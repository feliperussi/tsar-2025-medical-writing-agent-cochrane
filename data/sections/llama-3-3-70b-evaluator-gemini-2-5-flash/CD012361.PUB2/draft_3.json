  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation?\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term effects, benefits, and potential harms of using dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on breathing machines.\nWhat is this review about?\nNewborn babies who need a breathing machine often require sedation and pain relief to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a type of medicine that might be safer because it affects the body's blood circulation very little.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn babies?\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is a safe and effective way to provide pain relief and sedation for newborn babies on breathing machines, when compared to other medicines or a placebo (a dummy treatment). We looked at how well dexmedetomidine works for sedation and pain relief, and if it has any side effects.\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or a placebo in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. We did not limit our search to any particular language or date.\nWhat were the eligibility criteria?\nWe included studies that involved newborn babies (less than or equal to 28 days old) on invasive ventilation and reported at least one clinical outcome, such as duration of ventilation or sedation scores. We excluded studies that used non-pharmacologic comparators or lacked a control group.\nHow did we select and extract data?\nTwo reviewers independently screened study titles and abstracts, retrieved full texts, and extracted data using a predefined form. We resolved any discrepancies by consensus or with the help of a third reviewer.\nHow did we assess the risk of bias?\nWe evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, which covers randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting.\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine's efficacy and safety in the future.\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nBecause we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of dexmedetomidine. We have very low confidence in the evidence.\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and factually accurate, but it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is the inclusion of excessive methodological detail that is not relevant to the key finding that no studies were found. This makes the summary longer and more complex than necessary. Additionally, some phrasing in the limitations section is confusing, and several sentences could be more direct by using verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Condense the overly detailed methods section.**\n*   **Problem:** The sections on eligibility criteria, data selection, and risk of bias are too technical and unnecessary for a review that found no studies. This information does not help the reader understand the main outcome.\n*   **Quote:** \"What were the eligibility criteria? We included studies that involved newborn babies... What did we find? We found no eligible studies for inclusion.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Combine all the methods into a single, simpler paragraph. For example: \"**How did we do this review?** We searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives, pain relief medicines, or a placebo in newborn babies on breathing machines. We planned to combine the results of the studies and assess our confidence in the evidence, but we found no studies that met our criteria.\"\n\n**2. Clarify the 'Limitations' section.**\n*   **Problem:** The statement 'We have very low confidence in the evidence' is confusing when there is no evidence to have confidence in. This is technical jargon from the GRADE system that doesn't make sense in this context.\n*   **Quote:** \"Because we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of dexmedetomidine. We have very low confidence in the evidence.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to state the situation more directly. For example: \"**What are the limitations of this evidence?** Because we found no relevant studies, there is an absence of evidence. We cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of using dexmedetomidine for newborn babies on breathing machines.\"\n\n**3. Use more direct verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations).**\n*   **Problem:** Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy and abstract because they use nouns to describe actions. Using verbs makes the writing clearer and more engaging.\n*   **Quote:** \"We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, which covers randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** This sentence can be removed as part of simplifying the methods (see point 1). If a similar concept were needed, it should be rephrased with active verbs, such as: \"We planned to check how the studies were conducted to see if we could trust the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 16 of 18 metrics (89%) falling into the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This aligns with editorial feedback suggesting that some sentences could be more direct by using verbs instead of abstract nouns."
