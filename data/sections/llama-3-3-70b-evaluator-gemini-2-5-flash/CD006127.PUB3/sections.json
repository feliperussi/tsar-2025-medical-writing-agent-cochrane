  "key_messages": [
    "Controlling blood pressure (the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries) may help prevent diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness), especially in people with high blood pressure (hypertension) and type 2 diabetes, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about slowing the progression of the disease or its effects on vision loss.",
    "The benefits of blood pressure control for preventing diabetic retinopathy seem to be greater for people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes than for those without high blood pressure, but more research is needed to understand the effects in different groups of people and to find out whether controlling blood pressure can prevent the need for treatments for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy and other important outcomes, such as quality of life and costs, and should explore the benefits and harms of different approaches to controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes, to provide more reliable and applicable evidence for decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems. Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly, and it can lead to various health issues, including diabetic retinopathy. Controlling blood sugar levels is crucial to prevent the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy."

      "subheading": "What are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how does blood pressure control fit in?",
      "content": "While controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. High blood pressure can further damage the blood vessels in the retina, exacerbating the condition. Therefore, controlling blood pressure is often recommended as part of the treatment plan for diabetic retinopathy, in addition to managing blood sugar levels and other lifestyle changes."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about blood pressure control and diabetic retinopathy?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to investigate the effect of blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, as well as its impact on preserving visual acuity, reducing adverse events, and improving quality of life. They also wanted to examine the costs associated with blood pressure control in the context of diabetic retinopathy. By summarizing the existing evidence, the authors sought to provide a clearer understanding of the benefits and potential drawbacks of blood pressure control in managing diabetic retinopathy."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies, while nine studies received support from other sources. The studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, who were assigned to more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, or to blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention on blood pressure. The interventions and comparisons varied among the included trials, with some studies comparing different classes of antihypertensive medication. Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, quality of life, and costs."
