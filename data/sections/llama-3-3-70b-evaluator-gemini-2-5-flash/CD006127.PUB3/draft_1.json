  "draft": "# Keeping blood pressure under control can reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy and slow its progression\n**Key Messages**\n- Keeping blood pressure under control (reducing the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries) can help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness) and may slow its progression, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure (hypertension), but the evidence is not strong enough to confirm its effect on slowing progression in people without hypertension.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear benefit of blood pressure control on other outcomes such as preserving visual acuity (the sharpness of vision), quality of life, or costs, and it highlights the need for more research, particularly in people with normal blood pressure, to fully understand the effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy, focus on diverse populations, including those with type 1 diabetes, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets and treatment strategies to provide more definitive answers and guide clinical practice.\n**Introduction**\n### What is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems. Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly, and it can lead to various health issues, including diabetic retinopathy. Controlling blood sugar levels is crucial to prevent the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n### What are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how does blood pressure control fit in?\nWhile controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. High blood pressure can exacerbate the condition, making it worse. Therefore, controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended alongside blood sugar management. The goal is to reduce the risk of vision problems and slow down the progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about blood pressure control and diabetic retinopathy?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the effect of blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes. They wanted to know whether controlling blood pressure could help prevent diabetic retinopathy, slow down its progression, or improve vision outcomes. They also looked at the potential benefits and harms of blood pressure control in people with diabetes, including the risk of adverse events such as hypotension.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing blood pressure control methods in diabetics, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand its effect on diabetic retinopathy.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies, while nine studies received support from other sources. The studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, who were assigned to more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, or to blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention on blood pressure. The types of interventions and comparisons varied among the included trials, with some trials comparing different classes of antihypertensive medication. Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and incomplete coverage of the full range of people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.",

Furthermore, the text contains numerous long and complex sentences, and uses overly technical or academic vocabulary, making it difficult for the target audience to understand.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns. While the word count is within limits, a substantial portion of the metrics (12 out of 18, or 66.7%) fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 ranges, suggesting the text is considerably more complex than typical Plain Language Summaries. Specifically, readability indices such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.13), Automated Readability Index (16.63), Gunning Fog Index (19.43), LIX (62.03), RIX (9.46), and SMOG Index (16.00) are all very high, indicating a high educational attainment is required to understand the text. This is primarily driven by long sentences (average 27.07 words per sentence, P90) and complex vocabulary, as evidenced by high counts of nominalizations (22.0, P90), nouns (263.0, BEYOND_P90), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words (322.0, BEYOND_P90), complex words (163.0, BEYOND_P90), and long words (265.0, BEYOND_P90).
