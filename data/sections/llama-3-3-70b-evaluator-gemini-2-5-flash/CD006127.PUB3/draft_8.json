  "draft": "Can controlling blood pressure help with diabetic eye problems? \n- Keeping blood pressure under control probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure.\n- The evidence does not show that blood pressure control slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n- We need more research to understand the long-term effects of blood pressure control, especially for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy? \nDiabetic retinopathy is an eye problem that can cause vision loss and blindness in people with diabetes. It happens when high blood sugar damages the blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina).\n\nWhy did we do this review? \nWe wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure can help people with diabetes avoid or slow down diabetic retinopathy. While controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. High blood pressure can make the condition worse. Therefore, controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended alongside blood sugar management.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 29 studies that included 27,185 people with diabetes. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. We found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, the evidence does not show that it slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies we found were very different from one another. They included different types of people, used various methods to control blood pressure, and some studies were quite small. This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions, especially for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure. The evidence is up to date to September 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check for factual accuracy, which is the most important issue to resolve. There are also a few areas where clarity and structure could be improved to better help the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the finding on disease progression.**\nThe draft makes a definitive statement that is not supported by the source evidence.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence does not show that blood pressure control slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This statement is too strong and contradicts the nuance in the source material, which indicates the evidence is uncertain, not definitively negative. This could mislead a patient into believing there is no potential benefit, when the reality is that we don't know for sure.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"It is uncertain whether blood pressure control slows the progression of existing retinopathy. The evidence was not strong enough to be sure.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the purpose of the review.**\nThe 'Why we did this review' section includes findings, which can confuse the reader about what was already known versus what this review discovered.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"While controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence presents a conclusion in the section that should be explaining the question the review set out to answer. It preempts the results and disrupts the logical flow.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Replace the last two sentences of this section with a clearer statement of purpose, like: \"We wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure, in addition to blood sugar, can help people with diabetes avoid or slow down diabetic retinopathy.\"\n\n3. **Improve the structure by separating methods from results.**\nThe draft mixes information about the studies found (methods) with the actual findings (results) under one heading.\n- **Problematic section:** The \"What did we find?\" section begins by describing the number, location, and duration of the studies.\n- **Why it's a problem:** For clarity, it's better to first tell the reader *what studies you looked at* before telling them *what those studies found*. Combining them can make the results section feel cluttered.\n- **Suggested structure:** Create a new subheading like \"What studies did we review?\" and move the first three sentences from the \"What did we find?\" section under it. This will create a clearer separation between the methods and the results.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Key readability metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.77) and words per sentence (15.96) are in the best quartile (P25), indicating the text is generally easy to read. The use of active voice and personal pronouns is also strong. However, these positive metrics do not capture the critical factual inaccuracy and structural issues identified in the editorial review, which must be addressed before approval."
