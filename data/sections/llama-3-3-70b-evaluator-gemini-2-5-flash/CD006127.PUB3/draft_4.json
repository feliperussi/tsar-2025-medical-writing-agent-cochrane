  "draft": "Can keeping blood pressure under control reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy? \nWe found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. \nFor every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. \nHowever, the evidence does not show that it slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem? \nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. \nIt occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how does blood pressure control fit in? \nWhile controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHigh blood pressure can make the condition worse. \nTherefore, controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended alongside blood sugar management.\n\nHow did we conduct this review? \nWe searched for studies comparing blood pressure control methods in diabetics. \nWe found 29 studies that included 27,185 people with diabetes. \nThe studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. \nThe lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly. \nFor every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. \nHowever, we are uncertain if this intervention slows the progression of existing retinopathy or affects other outcomes like vision loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies we found were very different from one another. \nThey included different types of people with diabetes and used various methods to control blood pressure. \nThis makes it difficult to compare their results directly.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.\n\nKey messages:\n- Keeping blood pressure under control probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. \n- The evidence does not show that blood pressure control slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy, focus on diverse populations, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets and treatment strategies.",

      "feedback": "This draft has a strong, readable foundation but requires revisions for factual completeness and structural consistency before approval. The most critical issue is the omission of a key finding regarding which patient group benefits most from the intervention. Additionally, a subheading violates the required question-based format.\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the key finding about who benefits most.** The summary currently misses a crucial detail from the original review. The benefit of blood pressure control was most apparent for a specific group, and readers need this context.\n   - **Problem:** The draft states, \"We found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly.\" This is too general.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please add the nuance from the original abstract. In the 'What did we the find?' section, revise the sentence to: \"We found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure.\"\n\n2. **Rephrase the 'Key messages' subheading as a question.** All other subheadings are correctly phrased as questions, creating a consistent, easy-to-follow Q&A format. The final subheading breaks this important pattern.\n   - **Problem:** The subheading \"Key messages:\" is not a question and the bullet points are not dashes as required by the style guide.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change the subheading to: \"What are the key messages of this review?\" and ensure the list items begin with a dash (-).\n\n3. **Make the 'Limitations' section more specific.** The current explanation is generic. Adding more detail from the source material will help readers better understand the certainty of the evidence.\n   - **Problem:** The sentence \"They included different types of people with diabetes and used various methods to control blood pressure\" is vague.\n   - **Suggestion:** Consider expanding this to be more informative, for example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is a limited because the studies we found were very different from one another. They included different types of people, used various methods to control blood pressure, and some studies were quite small. This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions, especially for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical or best quartiles for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the average words per sentence (16.07) and use of passive voice (4 instances) are in the best 25% of our corpus. This indicates a strong structural foundation. However, the editorial review identified issues with factual completeness and nuance, which metrics alone cannot assess."
