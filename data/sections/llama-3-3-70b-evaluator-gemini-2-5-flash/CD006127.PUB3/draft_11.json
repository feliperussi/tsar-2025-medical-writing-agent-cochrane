  "draft": "Does controlling blood pressure help prevent or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness)?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Controlling blood pressure (the force of blood pushing against artery walls) may help prevent diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness. This benefit is especially true for people with high blood pressure (hypertension) and type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about slowing the disease's progression or its effects on vision loss.\n- The benefits of blood pressure control for preventing diabetic retinopathy seem to be greater for people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes than for those without high blood pressure. But more research is needed to understand the effects in different groups of people and to find out whether controlling blood pressure can prevent the need for treatments for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy and other important outcomes, such as quality of life and costs. They should also explore the benefits and harms of different approaches to controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes, to provide more reliable and applicable evidence for decision-making.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems. Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly, and it can lead to various health issues, including diabetic retinopathy. Controlling blood sugar levels is crucial to prevent the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n### What are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how does blood pressure control fit in?\nWhile controlling blood sugar is essential, research also shows that managing blood pressure is vital to prevent diabetic retinopathy from worsening. High blood pressure can further damage the blood vessels in the retina, exacerbating the condition. Therefore, controlling blood pressure is often recommended as part of the treatment plan for diabetic retinopathy, in addition to managing blood sugar levels and other lifestyle changes.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out about blood pressure control and diabetic retinopathy?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the effect of blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, as well as its impact on preserving visual acuity, reducing adverse events, and improving quality of life. They also wanted to examine the costs associated with blood pressure control in the context of diabetic retinopathy. By summarizing the existing evidence, the authors sought to provide a clearer understanding of the benefits and potential drawbacks of blood pressure control in managing diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing blood pressure control methods in diabetics, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand its effect on diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies, while nine studies received support from other sources. The studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, who were assigned to more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, or to blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention on blood pressure. Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, quality of life, and costs.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence has limitations because the studies included different groups of people and used various ways to control blood pressure. Some studies also had very few participants, and the research didn't cover all the types of people, treatments, comparisons, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.",

      "feedback": "The PLS is not approved. It contains a factual error and several areas where the language is too complex for a lay audience, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the description of the study participants.** The current text misstates who was included in the research.\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence \"We found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy\" is incorrect. The studies included people with diabetes, not all of whom already had retinopathy; a key goal was to see if the intervention could prevent the condition.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change this to: \"We found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetes.\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical and abstract language.** Many sentences use jargon and complex nouns instead of simple, direct language. This makes the text difficult to understand.\n    *   **Problem:** A sentence like, \"The review authors aimed to investigate the effect of blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, as well as its impact on preserving visual acuity...\" uses multiple technical terms without explanation.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this to be more direct. For example: \"We wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure could prevent diabetic retinopathy from starting (incidence) or slow it down if it had already begun (progression). We also looked at whether it helped people keep their eyesight.\"\n\n3. **Replace wordy, formal phrases with simpler alternatives.** The summary often uses formal phrasing that can be shortened and clarified.\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase \"By summarizing the existing evidence, the authors sought to provide a clearer understanding of the benefits and potential drawbacks...\" is unnecessarily complex.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please use simpler phrasing, such as: \"We reviewed the evidence to better understand the good and bad effects...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These clarity issues are confirmed by the linguistic analysis, which found that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns for vocabulary. The scores for complex words (`complex_words`: 164), long words (`long_words`: 270), and the SMOG index (16.0) are all well beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics are 'Beyond P90', including `smog_index` (16.0), `complex_words_dc` (315.0), `complex_words` (164.0), `long_words` (270.0), and `nouns` (255.0). This indicates the text uses substantially more complex, long, and technical words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, making it difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
