  "draft": "Can keeping blood pressure under control reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy? \nWe found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure. \nFor every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. \nHowever, the evidence does not show that it slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem? \nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. \nIt occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems. \nDiabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly, and it can lead to various health issues, including diabetic retinopathy.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how does blood pressure control fit in? \nWhile controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHigh blood pressure can exacerbate the condition, making it worse. \nTherefore, controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended alongside blood sugar management.\n\nHow did we conduct this review? \nWe searched for studies comparing blood pressure control methods in diabetics. \nWe found 29 studies that included 27,185 people with diabetes. \nThe studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. \nThe lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure. \nFor every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. \nHowever, we are uncertain if this intervention slows the progression of existing retinopathy or affects other outcomes like vision loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies we found were very different from one another. \nThey included different types of people, used various methods to control blood pressure, and some studies were quite small. \nThis makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions, especially for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review? \n- Keeping blood pressure under control probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure.\n- The evidence does not show that blood pressure control slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy, focus on diverse populations, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets and treatment strategies.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and factually accurate. With a few revisions to improve its structure and simplify some language, it can be even better for readers. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Reduce Repetition of the Main Finding:** The main result is stated in nearly identical words in the introduction, the 'What did we find?' section, and the 'Key messages'.\n    *   **Quote:** 'We found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly... For every 100 people... intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases...' (appears in both intro and results).\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Repeating the same detailed finding makes the summary feel disorganized and can cause readers to skip sections they think they've already read.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Keep the detailed finding in the 'What did we find?' section. Rewrite the introduction to be a simpler, higher-level summary. For example: 'This review looked at whether controlling blood pressure can help people with diabetes avoid or slow down an eye problem called diabetic retinopathy. We found it probably helps prevent the problem from starting, but the evidence did not show it helps slow the problem down if you already have it.'\n\n2. **Simplify Complex Vocabulary:** The summary uses some words that may be unfamiliar to a general audience. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing higher-than-usual counts for complex and long words.\n    *   **Quote:** 'High blood pressure can **exacerbate** the condition, making it worse.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Exacerbate' is a technical term. While you define it immediately, it's better to use the simpler word from the start.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'High blood pressure can **worsen** the condition.' or 'High blood pressure can **make the condition worse**.'\n\n3. **Use Consistent Language for Certainty:** The summary uses different phrases to describe the evidence about disease progression, which could be confusing.\n    *   **Quote:** In the results, you say, 'we are **uncertain** if this intervention slows the progression'. In the key messages, you say, 'The evidence **does not show** that blood pressure control slows the progression'.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Uncertain' suggests a lack of evidence, while 'does not show' implies that evidence was examined and found to show no benefit. The original abstract supports the second phrasing. Using consistent language helps the reader build a clear understanding.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Use the more direct and accurate phrasing in both places. Change the sentence in the 'What did we find?' section to: 'However, the evidence **does not show** that this intervention slows the progression of existing retinopathy...'\n\nThe evaluation shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics in the best quartile for readability, such as sentence length and active voice. However, it deviates from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. The SMOG index (13.82), complex word count (116), long word count (180), and noun count (165) are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than over 75% of summaries in the corpus. This supports the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure.",
