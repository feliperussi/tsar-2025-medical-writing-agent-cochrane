  "draft": "Can controlling blood pressure help with diabetic eye problems?\n- Keeping blood pressure under control probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure.\n- The evidence does not show that blood pressure control slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy, focus on diverse populations, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets and treatment strategies.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems. Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly, and it can lead to various health issues, including diabetic retinopathy.\n\nWhy we did this review\nWe wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure can help people with diabetes avoid or slow down diabetic retinopathy. While controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. High blood pressure can make the condition worse. Therefore, controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended alongside blood sugar management.\n\nWhat we found\nWe found 29 studies that included 27,185 people with diabetes. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. We found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, the evidence does not show that it slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies we found were very different from one another. They included different types of people, used various methods to control blood pressure, and some studies were quite small. This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions, especially for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure. The evidence is up to date to September 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and has good readability scores, but it is not approved because it fails to meet a key requirement of the style guide. Specifically, two subheadings are not phrased as questions. Additionally, there are opportunities to improve clarity for a lay audience by simplifying a key message and making definitions more concise.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Two subheadings currently do not meet this rule.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Why we did this review\" and \"What we found\".\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change them to \"Why did we do this review?\" and \"What did we find?\".\n\n2.  **Simplify the third key message.** The final key message is written for researchers, not patients. It's long and lists abstract concepts like 'diverse populations' and 'treatment strategies'.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy, focus on diverse populations, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets and treatment strategies.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase it to be more meaningful for a patient, for example: \"We need more research to understand the long-term effects of blood pressure control, especially for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure.\"\n\n3.  **Make the definition of diabetic retinopathy more direct.** The explanation in the first section is a bit circular and could be more concise for easier understanding.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems. Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels properly, and it can lead to various health issues, including diabetic retinopathy.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Combine these ideas into a more direct explanation, such as: \"Diabetic retinopathy is an eye problem that can cause vision loss and blindness in people with diabetes. It happens when high blood sugar damages the blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All metrics fall within acceptable ranges, with 10 out of 18 features (55.6%) in the best quartile for readability and clarity. For example, the average words per sentence (18.73) and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (11.70) are both in the best 25% of the corpus, indicating strong readability. The feedback provided focuses on style guide adherence and minor clarity improvements rather than addressing statistical deviations, as none were significant."
