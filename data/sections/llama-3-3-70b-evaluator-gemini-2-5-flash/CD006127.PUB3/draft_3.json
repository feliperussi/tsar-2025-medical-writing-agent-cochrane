  "draft": "Can keeping blood pressure under control reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy and slow its progression? \nWe found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. \nFor every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. \nHowever, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem? \nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can cause visual impairment and blindness. \nIt occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how does blood pressure control fit in? \nWhile controlling blood sugar levels is essential, research has also shown that managing blood pressure is vital in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHigh blood pressure can make the condition worse. \nTherefore, controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended alongside blood sugar management.\n\nHow did we conduct this review? \nWe searched for studies comparing blood pressure control methods in diabetics, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand its effect on diabetic retinopathy.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetes. \nThe studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. \nThe lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. \nEight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies, while nine studies received support from other sources. \nThe studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, who were assigned to more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, or to blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention on blood pressure. \nThe types of interventions and comparisons varied among the included trials, with some trials comparing different classes of antihypertensive medication. \nIntervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. \nFor every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. \nHowever, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence has some limitations - the studies were quite different from each other, the number of participants in some studies was small, and not all relevant outcomes were reported. \nThis means that we cannot be certain about the effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021. \n\nKey messages:\n- Keeping blood pressure under control can help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy and may slow its progression, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear benefit of blood pressure control on other outcomes such as preserving visual acuity, quality of life, or costs.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy, focus on diverse populations, including those with type 1 diabetes, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure targets and treatment strategies.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions for factual accuracy and clarity before it can be approved. The most critical issue is a key message that misrepresents the review's findings on disease progression. Additionally, the results section is dense and mixes methods with findings, making it hard for readers to grasp the main takeaways.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Misleading Key Message on Progression:** The first key message overstates the evidence for slowing the progression of retinopathy.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Keeping blood pressure under control can help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy and may slow its progression...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is factually inaccurate. The review's main results found no clear evidence that blood pressure control slows progression (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12). Stating it \"may slow its progression\" gives readers false hope and misrepresents the findings.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Keeping blood pressure under control probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. However, the evidence does not show that it slows the progression of existing retinopathy.\"\n\n2. **Clarify and Restructure the 'What did we find?' Section:** This section currently begins with a long, dense paragraph of methodological details, burying the actual results.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetes. The studies were conducted in several countries... The studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants... The types of interventions and comparisons varied... Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers have to get through five sentences of study characteristics before reaching the main finding. This structure reduces clarity and impact.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Split the information. Move the study details to the 'How did we conduct this review?' section and lead the 'Results' section with the key findings.\n     - **Add to 'Methods':** \"We found 29 studies that included 27,185 people with diabetes.\"\n     - **Rewrite 'Results' to start with:** \"We found that controlling blood pressure probably reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, we are uncertain if this intervention slows the progression of existing retinopathy or affects other outcomes like vision loss.\"\n\n3. **Make the Limitations More Specific:** The explanation of the evidence's limitations is too vague.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence has some limitations - the studies were quite different from each other, the number of participants in some studies was small, and not all relevant outcomes were reported.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a generic list that doesn't help the reader understand the specific issues with this body of evidence. It lacks context.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies we found were very different from one another. They included different types of people with diabetes and used various methods to control blood pressure. This makes it difficult to compare their results directly.\"\n\nAddressing these points will also help improve the vocabulary complexity scores, which are currently higher than typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with excellent use of active voice (P75) and personal pronouns (P75). However, the draft shows significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, SMOG index, complex words (both types), and long words—are in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for this format. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify dense paragraphs and replace technical phrasing with more direct, everyday language."
