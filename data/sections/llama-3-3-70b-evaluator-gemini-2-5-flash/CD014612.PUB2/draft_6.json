  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\n– Gastric bypass surgery is a weight-loss procedure. During this surgery, closing holes (defects) in the tissue might help prevent internal hernias (where an organ bulges through a weak spot). However, the evidence for this is not strong.\n– Closing defects may reduce internal hernias, but it might not affect postoperative complications (problems after surgery) or mortality (death).\n– Future research needs to be well-designed and include enough participants to provide more reliable evidence.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a type of weight-loss surgery. RYGB involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems. The risk of internal hernia is a significant concern for people undergoing RYGB, and finding ways to prevent it is crucial.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during RYGB surgery can help prevent internal hernia. They wanted to assess the benefits and harms of defect closure compared to not closing the defects. Specifically, they looked at the incidence of internal hernia, postoperative complications, mortality, and other outcomes to determine the effectiveness of defect closure in preventing internal hernia after RYGB.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The population characteristics included people with obesity, defined as a body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m². The studies did not report on the age, gender, or severity of condition of the participants. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The types of interventions included non-absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non-absorbable running sutures in two studies. The funding sources were not dedicated, as this Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft is not approved. While it passes all critical checks for structure and completeness, there are three key areas that need improvement to ensure clarity for a lay audience.\n\n1. **The results section contains unexplained technical jargon.** This makes it difficult for readers to understand the key details of the studies.\n    *   **Problem:** 'The types of interventions included non-absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non-absorbable running sutures in two studies.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** This level of technical detail is not necessary for a plain language summary. Remove this sentence and other unnecessary details (e.g., about funding, unreported demographics) to focus on the main findings. A simpler approach would be: 'We found 3 studies with 3010 people who had weight-loss surgery. The studies compared closing the tissue holes with not closing them.'\n\n2. **The limitations of the evidence are described inaccurately.** The draft misidentifies the primary limitation, which could confuse readers about the state of the evidence.\n    *   **Problem:** 'The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** The total number of participants (3010) is large. The main limitation noted in the abstract is the small *number of studies*. Please rewrite this to be more accurate: 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only three relevant studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings.'\n\n3. **The first key message is too long and complex.** It tries to combine a main finding with multiple definitions, reducing its impact and clarity.\n    *   **Problem:** '– Gastric bypass surgery is a weight-loss procedure. During this surgery, closing holes (defects) in the tissue might help prevent internal hernias (where an organ bulges through a weak spot). However, the evidence for this is not strong.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Simplify and split this into two distinct messages. For example: '– Closing small holes in the tissue during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent a complication called an internal hernia.' followed by '– However, we have low confidence in the evidence, and more research is needed.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the text has a high number of nouns, long words, and complex words for a plain language summary, particularly in the results section.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with low sentence length (19.25 words) and minimal passive voice (7 instances). However, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for nouns (164), Dale-Chall complex words (235), and long words (177) are all in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a PLS. This suggests a need to simplify technical terms and replace long words with shorter, more common alternatives."
