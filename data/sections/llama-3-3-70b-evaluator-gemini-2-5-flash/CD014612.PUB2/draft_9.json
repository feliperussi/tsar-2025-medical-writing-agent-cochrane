  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\nKey messages\n- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent internal hernias, but the evidence is not strong.\n- Closing these defects may reduce the risk of internal hernias, but it probably makes little to no difference to the risk of complications or death after surgery.\n- More high-quality research is needed to provide more certain evidence.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after gastric bypass surgery?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after gastric bypass surgery. It happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after gastric bypass surgery?\nWe aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during gastric bypass surgery can help prevent internal hernia. We looked at how often internal hernias, complications after surgery, and deaths occurred. This helped us understand if closing the defects was effective and safe.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after gastric bypass surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with 3010 people who had weight-loss surgery. The studies compared closing the holes with not closing them. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only three relevant studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-written draft that is very close to approval. However, I am recommending a few revisions to improve clarity for the reader before it is finalized. My main concern is that the primary condition, 'internal hernia', is mentioned in the key messages without a simple definition, which could confuse readers right from the start. I have outlined three specific suggestions below to address this and other minor consistency issues. Once these are addressed, the summary should be ready for publication.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Define \"Internal Hernia\" in the Key Messages**\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent internal hernias, but the evidence is not strong.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The term \"internal hernia\" is central to the review but is not explained in the key messages where it first appears. A patient might not know what this is, making this key takeaway less meaningful until they read further.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** We suggest adding a brief, simple definition in parentheses. For example: \"- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent internal hernias (where part of the intestine bulges through a hole), but the evidence is not strong.\"\n\n**2. Explain the Limitation More Clearly**\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only three relevant studies.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This statement is correct but doesn't explain *why* a small number of studies is a limitation. Explaining the reasoning helps build reader trust and understanding of evidence certainty.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Please explain the implication of this limitation. For example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited mainly because it is based on only three studies. When findings come from a small number of studies, we are less certain about the results.\"\n\n**3. Use Consistent Terminology for the Surgery**\n*   **Problematic Text:** The text uses \"gastric bypass surgery\" in some sections but switches to \"weight-loss surgery\" in the results (\"...3010 people who had weight-loss surgery.\").\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Switching between a general term (\"weight-loss surgery\") and the specific term used elsewhere (\"gastric bypass surgery\") can create minor confusion. Sticking to one term improves readability.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** For clarity, please use the term \"gastric bypass surgery\" consistently. For example, change the sentence in the results section to: \"We found 3 studies with 3010 people who had **gastric bypass surgery**.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the expected median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent readability and structural quality. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is low at 9.5, and the use of passive voice is minimal (3 instances). The metrics confirm the draft is well-structured; the recommended edits focus on improving content clarity and consistency for the reader."
