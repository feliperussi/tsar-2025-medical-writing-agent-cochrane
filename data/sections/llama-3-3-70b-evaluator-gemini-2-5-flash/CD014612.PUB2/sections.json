  "key_messages": [
    "Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery, a procedure known as gastric bypass surgery (a type of surgery that helps with weight loss by changing how the stomach and small intestine handle food), may help prevent internal hernias (a condition where part of an organ bulges through a weakened area in the muscle or tissue that normally holds it in place), but the evidence is not strong.",
    "The closure of defects may reduce the incidence of internal hernias, but it may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery) or mortality (death).",
    "Future research should focus on designing trials with low risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others) and adequate sample size (the number of people participating in a study) to provide more certain evidence."

      "subheading": "What is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?",
      "content": "Internal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a type of weight-loss surgery. RYGB involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems. The risk of internal hernia is a significant concern for people undergoing RYGB, and finding ways to prevent it is crucial."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during RYGB surgery can help prevent internal hernia. They wanted to assess the benefits and harms of defect closure compared to not closing the defects. Specifically, they looked at the incidence of internal hernia, postoperative complications, mortality, and other outcomes to determine the effectiveness of defect closure in preventing internal hernia after RYGB."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The population characteristics included people with obesity, defined as a body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m². The studies did not report on the age, gender, or severity of condition of the participants. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The types of interventions included non-absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non-absorbable running sutures in two studies. The funding sources were not dedicated, as this Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.",
