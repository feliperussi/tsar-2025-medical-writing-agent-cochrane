  "draft": "# Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n**Key Messages**\n- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery (a type of weight-loss surgery) may help prevent internal hernias (a complication where part of the intestine bulges through a weakened area), but the evidence is not very certain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The closure of defects may not make a big difference in the overall complications or death rate after surgery, but it might lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, although the evidence for this is very uncertain.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of closing defects during gastric bypass surgery and should be designed to provide more reliable evidence to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best approach for this type of surgery.\n**Introduction**\n## What is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for weight loss. RYGB is a type of bariatric surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine to this pouch. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other serious health issues. This complication can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly treated.\n## What did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of closing mesenteric defects (weaknesses in the abdominal wall) during RYGB surgery to prevent internal hernia. They wanted to determine whether closing these defects reduces the risk of internal hernia and its associated complications, such as bowel obstruction, and if it affects other outcomes like postoperative complications, mortality, and hospital stay length. The authors also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and decision-making.\n**Methods**\n## Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of defect closure for preventing internal hernia.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The population characteristics included people with obesity, defined as a body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m². The studies did not report on the age, gender, or severity of condition of the participants. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The interventions used non-absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non-absorbable running sutures in two studies. The studies did not report on the funding sources, but the review had no dedicated funding. The review did not find any studies that reported on the long-term outcomes of the interventions. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of overall complications, mortality, or intraoperative complications. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the outcomes, resulting in low confidence.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

Specifically, 'words_per_sentence' (28.00) and 'long_words' (210.00) are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating excessively long sentences and too many long words. Metrics such as 'nouns' (197.00), 'automated_readability_index' (15.43), 'gunning_fog_index' (19.65), 'lix' (60.61), 'rix' (9.13), 'smog_index' (14.09), 'complex_words_dc' (270.00), and 'complex_words' (136.00) are all in the P90 range, suggesting the text is noun-heavy, uses too many complex and unfamiliar words, and is generally much harder to read than typical PLS texts."
