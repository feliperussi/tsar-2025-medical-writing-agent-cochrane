  "draft": "# Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n**Key Messages**\n- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery, a procedure known as gastric bypass surgery (a type of surgery that helps with weight loss by changing how the stomach and small intestine handle food), may help prevent internal hernias (a condition where part of an organ bulges through a weakened area in the muscle or tissue that normally holds it in place), but the evidence is not strong.\n- The closure of defects may reduce the incidence of internal hernias, but it may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery) or mortality (death).\n- Future research should focus on designing trials with low risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others) and adequate sample size (the number of people participating in a study) to provide more certain evidence.\n**Introduction**\n### What is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a type of weight-loss surgery. RYGB involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems. The risk of internal hernia is a significant concern for people undergoing RYGB, and finding ways to prevent it is crucial.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during RYGB surgery can help prevent internal hernia. They wanted to assess the benefits and harms of defect closure compared to not closing the defects. Specifically, they looked at the incidence of internal hernia, postoperative complications, mortality, and other outcomes to determine the effectiveness of defect closure in preventing internal hernia after RYGB.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The population characteristics included people with obesity, defined as a body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m². The studies did not report on the age, gender, or severity of condition of the participants. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The types of interventions included non-absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non-absorbable running sutures in two studies. The funding sources were not dedicated, as this Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to failing a critical check regarding subheading format and containing several significant clarity and style issues that would hinder patient understanding. The linguistic analysis supports these observations, indicating higher-than-typical sentence length and vocabulary complexity for a Plain Language Summary.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions, which violates the `MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE` requirement for subheadings to be questions.\n\n**Top 5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Overly long and complex sentence in Key Message 1:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery, a procedure known as gastric bypass surgery (a type of surgery that helps with weight loss by changing how the stomach and small intestine handle food), may help prevent internal hernias (a condition where part of an organ bulges through a weakened area in the muscle or tissue that normally holds it in place), but the evidence is not strong.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is 68 words long, contains redundant information, and uses nested parenthetical definitions, making it extremely difficult to read and understand. It attempts to define \"gastric bypass surgery\" and \"internal hernias\" within a single, already complex sentence.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Gastric bypass surgery is a weight-loss procedure. During this surgery, closing holes (defects) in the tissue might help prevent internal hernias (where an organ bulges through a weak spot). However, the evidence for this is not strong.\"\n\n2.  **Jargon and lengthy definitions in Key Message 3:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Future research should focus on designing trials with low risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others) and adequate sample size (the number of people participating in a study) to provide more certain evidence.\"\n    *   **Problem:** While definitions are provided, they are long and interrupt the flow of the key message. \"Risk of bias\" is technical, and its detailed definition is too much for a key message. \"Adequate sample size\" is also defined unnecessarily.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Future research needs to be well-designed and include enough participants to provide more reliable evidence.\"\n\n3.  **Wordiness and nominalization:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"The closure of defects may reduce the incidence of internal hernias, but it may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery) or mortality (death).\"\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase \"incidence of\" is repeated and \"make a difference in the incidence of\" is wordy. This contributes to a higher noun count and less direct language.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Closing defects may reduce internal hernias, but it might not affect postoperative complications (problems after surgery) or mortality (death).\"\n\n4.  **Subheading Format (reiteration for improvement):**\n    *   **Problem:** As noted in the critical issues, the subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Rephrase these subheadings as questions. For example:\n        *   \"Methods\" → \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n        *   \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of this evidence?\"\n        *   \"Currency\" → \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n5.  **Formatting of bullet points and white space:**\n    *   **Problem:** The key messages use hyphens (-) instead of dashes (–) for bullet points, and there are missing blank lines between headings and paragraphs, making the text appear dense.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Use a dash (–) for bullet points in the Key Messages section. Add a blank line after the main title, after the 'Key Messages' section, and after each subheading to improve readability and visual separation.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like passive voice, active voice, pronouns, and nominalization are within or close to typical ranges, several key metrics deviate significantly. The average sentence length (words_per_sentence: 25.96, P90) is notably higher than typical PLS texts, indicating sentences are too long. Vocabulary complexity metrics (nouns: 195.00, P90; complex_words_dc: 268.00, P90; complex_words: 126.00, P90; long_words: 197.00, P90) are also higher, suggesting the use of more difficult or longer words than ideal for a plain language summary. Readability indices like SMOG (13.68, P90) and RIX (8.21, P90) further confirm the text's higher-than-average reading difficulty. These deviations align with the identified clarity issues, particularly the long, complex sentences and the use of jargon."
