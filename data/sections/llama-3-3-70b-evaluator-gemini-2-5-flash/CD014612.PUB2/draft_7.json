  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\n– Closing small holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery, a procedure known as gastric bypass surgery (a type of surgery that helps with weight loss by changing how the stomach and small intestine handle food), may help prevent internal hernias (a condition where part of an organ bulges through a weakened area in the muscle or tissue that normally holds it in place).\n– However, we have low confidence in the evidence, and more research is needed.\n– The closure of defects may reduce the incidence of internal hernias, but it may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery) or mortality (death).\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a type of weight-loss surgery. RYGB involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems. The risk of internal hernia is a significant concern for people undergoing RYGB, and finding ways to prevent it is crucial.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during RYGB surgery can help prevent internal hernia. They wanted to assess the benefits and harms of defect closure compared to not closing the defects. Specifically, they looked at the incidence of internal hernia, postoperative complications, mortality, and other outcomes to determine the effectiveness of defect closure in preventing internal hernia after RYGB.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with 3010 people who had weight-loss surgery. The studies compared closing the tissue holes with not closing them. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only three relevant studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is strong and factually accurate, but it needs a few key revisions to improve clarity for readers before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas to focus on:\n\n1. **Simplify the first key message.** This sentence is the first thing many people will read, but its length and structure make it very hard to understand.\n    *   **The issue:** The sentence is 63 words long and contains multiple nested definitions: '– Closing small holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery, a procedure known as gastric bypass surgery (a type of surgery that helps with weight loss by changing how the stomach and small intestine handle food), may help prevent internal hernias (a condition where part of an organ bulges through a weakened area in the muscle or tissue that normally holds it in place).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter, more focused sentences. For example: 'Gastric bypass is a type of weight-loss surgery. During this procedure, closing small holes in internal tissue (called defects) may help prevent a serious complication called an internal hernia.'\n\n2. **Remove redundant information and jargon from the introduction.** The introduction re-defines terms and uses a technical acronym that isn't necessary for a plain language summary.\n    *   **The issue:** The text defines gastric bypass surgery in the key messages and then again in the first paragraph: '...Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a type of weight-loss surgery. RYGB involves creating a small stomach pouch...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Avoid repeating definitions. Also, avoid using the acronym 'RYGB'. Sticking to the full term, 'gastric bypass surgery', is clearer for a lay audience. Consider this rewrite: 'Internal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after a weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.'\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology for the main concept.** The summary uses several different terms for the 'defects', which could confuse readers.\n    *   **The issue:** The text refers to 'holes in the tissue (defects)', 'defects in the abdominal wall', and 'tissue holes'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Choose the clearest term and use it consistently. 'Closing small holes in the tissue (defects)' is a good, descriptive option. Once defined, you can simply use 'closing the holes' or 'defect closure' throughout the rest of the text.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. An impressive 78% of the metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and simplicity (e.g., low passive voice, high active voice). The average sentence length (20.83 words) is well within the target range. However, this average score obscures the impact of a few overly long and complex sentences, such as the first key message, highlighting the importance of editorial review alongside metric analysis."
