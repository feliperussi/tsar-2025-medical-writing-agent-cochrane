  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\n- Closing these holes during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent internal hernias. However, the evidence is not very certain, and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Closing defects may not make a big difference in overall complications or death rate after surgery. But it might lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, although the evidence for this is very uncertain.\n- Future studies should look at the long-term effects of closing these holes. This research will give doctors and patients better evidence to help them decide on the best surgical approach.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for weight loss. RYGB is a type of bariatric surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine to this pouch. After this surgery, small gaps or holes (called 'mesenteric defects') can be left in the tissue that holds the intestines in place. An internal hernia happens when part of the intestine pushes through one of these holes, which can cause a dangerous blockage.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these holes ('mesenteric defects') during surgery to prevent internal hernias. We aimed to determine whether closing these defects reduces the risk of internal hernia and its associated complications, such as bowel obstruction.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared closing the holes with not closing them in people who had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of overall complications, mortality, or intraoperative complications. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the outcomes, resulting in low confidence.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",
