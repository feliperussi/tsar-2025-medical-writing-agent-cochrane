  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\n- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery (a type of weight-loss surgery) may help prevent internal hernias (a complication where part of the intestine bulges through a weakened area), but the evidence is not very certain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The closure of defects may not make a big difference in the overall complications or death rate after surgery, but it might lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, although the evidence for this is very uncertain.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of closing defects during gastric bypass surgery and should be designed to provide more reliable evidence to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best approach for this type of surgery.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for weight loss. RYGB is a type of bariatric surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine to this pouch. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other serious health issues.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of closing mesenteric defects (weaknesses in the abdominal wall) during RYGB surgery to prevent internal hernia. They wanted to determine whether closing these defects reduces the risk of internal hernia and its associated complications, such as bowel obstruction, and if it affects other outcomes like postoperative complications, mortality, and hospital stay length.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared closing the holes with not closing them in people who had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of overall complications, mortality, or intraoperative complications. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the outcomes, resulting in low confidence.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. All critical checks passed. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on three main improvements before approval.\n\n1. **Break up long sentences to make them easier to follow.** Some sentences combine multiple ideas, which can be difficult for readers to process. Aiming for one main idea per sentence improves clarity.\n    *   **For example:** \"Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of closing defects during gastric bypass surgery and should be designed to provide more reliable evidence to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best approach for this type of surgery.\"\n    *   **Consider this rewrite:** \"Future studies should look at the long-term effects of closing these holes. This research will give doctors and patients better evidence to help them decide on the best surgical approach.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the main technical term ('mesenteric defect') earlier and more simply.** The summary explains what an internal hernia is, but the explanation of the 'defect' itself could be clearer and more consistent for a lay audience.\n    *   **For example:** The text currently says an internal hernia is when the \"intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall\". This is a bit general.\n    *   **Consider this rewrite in the 'What is internal hernia...' section:** \"After this surgery, small gaps or holes (called 'mesenteric defects') can be left in the tissue that holds the intestines in place. An internal hernia happens when part of the intestine pushes through one of these holes, which can cause a dangerous blockage.\"\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language.** Some sentences are a bit formal and wordy. Using simpler phrasing and the active voice makes the text more accessible and aligns with style guidelines.\n    *   **For example:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of closing mesenteric defects (weaknesses in the abdominal wall) during RYGB surgery to prevent internal hernia.\"\n    *   **Consider this rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these holes ('mesenteric defects') during surgery to prevent internal hernias.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the average sentence length is on the higher end for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile. However, the 'words_per_sentence' metric is in the P75 range (24.48 words), indicating that sentences are longer on average than in most PLS texts. This statistical finding supports the editorial recommendation to shorten complex sentences to improve reader comprehension."
