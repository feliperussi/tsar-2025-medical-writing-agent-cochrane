  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias\n\nGastric bypass is a type of weight-loss surgery. During this procedure, closing small holes in internal tissue, called defects, may help prevent a serious complication called an internal hernia. However, we have low confidence in the evidence, and more research is needed. The closure of defects may reduce the incidence of internal hernias, but it may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or mortality.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after gastric bypass surgery\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight-loss surgery. It happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems. The risk of internal hernia is a significant concern for people undergoing gastric bypass surgery, and finding ways to prevent it is crucial.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after gastric bypass surgery\nThe review authors aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during gastric bypass surgery can help prevent internal hernia. They wanted to assess the benefits and harms of defect closure compared to not closing the defects. Specifically, they looked at the incidence of internal hernia, postoperative complications, mortality, and other outcomes to determine the effectiveness of defect closure in preventing internal hernia after gastric bypass surgery.\n\nHow did we conduct this review\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after gastric bypass surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find\nWe found 3 studies with 3010 people who had weight-loss surgery. The studies compared closing the holes with not closing them. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only three relevant studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and structure for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add a 'Key messages' Section for Scannability:** The first paragraph combines all the main findings into a dense block of text. This makes it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the most important takeaways. \n   - **Problem:** \"Does closing holes in the tissue during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias. Gastric bypass is a type of weight-loss surgery. During this procedure, closing small holes in internal tissue, called defects, may help prevent a serious complication called an internal hernia. However, we have low confidence in the evidence, and more research is needed. The closure of defects may reduce the incidence of internal hernias, but it may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or mortality.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace this paragraph with a dedicated heading and bullet points, as provided in the source material. This makes the main conclusions much easier to find and read.  \n     **Key messages**\n     - Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent internal hernias, but the evidence is not strong.\n     - Closing these defects may reduce the risk of internal hernias, but it probably makes little to no difference to the risk of complications or death after surgery.\n     - More high-quality research is needed to provide more certain evidence.\n\n2. **Simplify Definitions and Remove Redundancy:** The text sometimes repeats information or defines terms in a wordy way, which can slow the reader down.\n   - **Problem:** In the section 'What is internal hernia...', the text says: \"...after gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight-loss surgery.\" The first paragraph has already established that gastric bypass is weight-loss surgery.\n   - **Suggestion:** Remove the repeated definition. Simply write: \"Internal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after gastric bypass surgery.\"\n\n3. **Break Up Long, Complex Sentences:** Some sentences are too long and contain multiple ideas, making them difficult to follow. The linguistic analysis shows the average sentence length is on the higher side for a Plain Language Summary.\n   - **Problem:** \"Specifically, they looked at the incidence of internal hernia, postoperative complications, mortality, and other outcomes to determine the effectiveness of defect closure in preventing internal hernia after gastric bypass surgery.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Break this 33-word sentence into two shorter, more direct sentences. For example: \"We looked at how often internal hernias, complications after surgery, and deaths occurred. This helped us understand if closing the defects was effective and safe.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling in the best quartile. There are no significant statistical deviations. However, the 'words_per_sentence' metric is in the P75 range (22.16 words), indicating that sentences are longer than is typical for a PLS. This quantitative finding supports the qualitative feedback to shorten and simplify complex sentences to improve readability for a lay audience."
