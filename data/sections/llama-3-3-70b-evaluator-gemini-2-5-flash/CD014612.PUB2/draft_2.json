  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\n- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery (a type of weight-loss surgery) may help prevent internal hernias (a complication where part of the intestine bulges through a weakened area), but the evidence is not very certain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The closure of defects may not make a big difference in the overall complications or death rate after surgery, but it might lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, although the evidence for this is very uncertain.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of closing defects during gastric bypass surgery and should be designed to provide more reliable evidence to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best approach for this type of surgery.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for weight loss. RYGB is a type of bariatric surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine to this pouch. Internal hernia happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other serious health issues.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after RYGB?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of closing mesenteric defects (weaknesses in the abdominal wall) during RYGB surgery to prevent internal hernia. They wanted to determine whether closing these defects reduces the risk of internal hernia and its associated complications, such as bowel obstruction, and if it affects other outcomes like postoperative complications, mortality, and hospital stay length.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of overall complications, mortality, or intraoperative complications. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the outcomes, resulting in low confidence.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile. The use of active voice, pronouns, and control of nominalizations are all excellent. However, there are significant deviations in two key areas that impact readability. The average sentence length ('words_per_sentence') is 25.9 words, placing it in the 90th percentile and indicating that sentences are longer than is typical for a PLS. Similarly, the long word density ('rix') is also in the 90th percentile. These metrics support the editorial feedback to shorten complex sentences to improve clarity for the reader."
