  "draft": "Does allowing family members to be present during a patient's resuscitation help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\nKey messages:\n- Family presence during resuscitation does not have enough evidence to support its benefits or harms on relatives' psychological outcomes, including stress and anxiety.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the effects of family presence during resuscitation on patient morbidity and mortality are unclear.\n- Future research should focus on conducting sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trials to investigate the effects of family presence during resuscitation on relatives' psychological outcomes and patient care.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation refers to the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. This practice involves a relationship between healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient, where the presence of relatives can impact all three groups. Family presence during resuscitation is based on the principle that patients and their relatives often want to be actively involved in treatment decisions, even during critical care situations like resuscitation.\n\nWhy is family presence during resuscitation a significant issue?\nThe health condition in question is the psychological and emotional well-being of relatives who witness a resuscitation attempt, as well as the potential impact on patient care and healthcare professionals. Relatives who are present during resuscitation may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event - related symptoms, anxiety - a feeling of worry or nervousness, depression - a mood disorder characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest, and complicated grief. On the other hand, family presence during resuscitation may also have benefits, such as improved patient and relative satisfaction, better communication, and more empathetic care. However, there is a need to balance the needs and well-being of all parties involved.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the effects of offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation on the occurrence of PTSD-related symptoms, other psychological outcomes, and patient morbidity - diseases or conditions that affect a patient - and mortality - death rate. They also wanted to investigate the impact of family presence during resuscitation on medical treatment and care during resuscitation, as well as the personal stress and attitudes of healthcare professionals towards family presence during resuscitation.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies examining the effects of family presence during resuscitation, using databases such as PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL with keywords and MeSH terms related to \"family presence\", \"resuscitation\", and \"psychological outcomes\". We also checked references and citations of eligible studies using Scopus, and searched for relevant systematic reviews using Epistomonikos. Furthermore, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry for ongoing trials; OpenGrey for grey literature; and Google Scholar for additional trials.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for around 1 year, with one study being a cluster-randomized trial and the other a small pilot study. The interventions compared were the systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) - a medical procedure that combines chest compressions with rescue breaths to help restore blood circulation and breathing in a person who has stopped breathing or whose heart has stopped beating - with the traditional practice. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of PTSD-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This summary is factually accurate and complete, but it is not ready for publication. The language is too academic and dense for a general audience, making it difficult to understand. The main problems are overly long sentences, complex vocabulary, and the use of passive, noun-heavy phrasing. To improve the summary, please focus on the top 3 improvements listed below.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Break down long, complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones.**\nMany sentences are over 30 words long and contain multiple ideas, which can confuse readers. Aim for one main idea per sentence.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The review authors aimed to investigate the effects of offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation on the occurrence of PTSD-related symptoms, other psychological outcomes, and patient morbidity - diseases or conditions that affect a patient - and mortality - death rate.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** At 46 words, this sentence is too long and packed with technical terms. It forces the reader to hold too much information in their head at once.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out what effect offering family members the choice to be present during resuscitation had on them. Specifically, we looked for effects on their mental health, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We also looked at the effects on the patient's health and survival.\"\n\n**2. Replace complex and formal language with everyday words.**\nThe summary often uses formal phrasing and jargon where simpler words would be clearer.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The interventions compared were the systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) - a medical procedure that combines chest compressions with rescue breaths to help restore blood circulation and breathing in a person who has stopped breathing or whose heart has stopped beating - with the traditional practice.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 51-word sentence buries a helpful definition of CPR inside a very complex structure. Phrases like \"systematic offer\" and \"traditional practice\" are vague for a lay reader.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared two approaches. In one group, family members were always offered the choice to be present during CPR. (CPR is an emergency procedure to restart someone's heart and breathing). In the other group, families were treated in the usual way, which often meant they were not invited to be present.\"\n\n**3. Use active voice and strong verbs instead of passive voice and nouns.**\nThe summary has many instances of passive voice and nominalizations (turning verbs into nouns, e.g., \"make a decision\" instead of \"decide\"), which makes the text feel indirect and academic.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Family presence during resuscitation is based on the principle that patients and their relatives often want to be actively involved in treatment decisions, even during critical care situations like resuscitation.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is passive and wordy. Using active verbs makes the writing more direct and engaging.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We know that patients and their families often want to be involved when doctors decide on treatments. This can be true even in emergencies, like during a resuscitation.\"\n\nBy addressing these key areas, you will significantly improve the clarity and readability of the summary for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 15 of 18 metrics falling outside the median range. Readability scores are very low (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease is 24.64, below the 10th percentile), indicating the text is difficult for a lay audience to read. This is driven by very long sentences (25 words on average), a high number of complex and long words (173 and 265 respectively), and excessive use of passive voice (21 instances) and nominalizations (58 instances)."
