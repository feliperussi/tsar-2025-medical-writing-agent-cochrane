  "draft": "Does allowing family members to be present during a patient's resuscitation help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\nKey messages:\n- Family presence during resuscitation does not have enough evidence to support its benefits or harms on relatives' psychological outcomes, including stress and anxiety.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the effects of family presence during resuscitation on patient morbidity and mortality are unclear.\n- Future research should focus on conducting sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trials to investigate the effects of family presence during resuscitation on relatives' psychological outcomes and patient care.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation refers to the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. This practice involves a relationship between healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient, where the presence of relatives can impact all three groups. We know that patients and their families often want to be involved when doctors decide on treatments. This can be true even in emergencies, like during a resuscitation.\n\nWhy is family presence during resuscitation a significant issue?\nThe health condition in question is the psychological and emotional well-being of relatives who witness a resuscitation attempt, as well as the potential impact on patient care and healthcare professionals. Relatives who are present during resuscitation may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event, anxiety - a feeling of worry or nervousness, depression - a mood disorder characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest, and complicated grief. On the other hand, family presence during resuscitation may also have benefits, such as improved patient and relative satisfaction, better communication, and more empathetic care. However, there is a need to balance the needs and well-being of all parties involved.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what effect offering family members the choice to be present during resuscitation had on them. Specifically, we looked for effects on their mental health, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We also looked at the effects on the patient's health and survival.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies examining the effects of family presence during resuscitation, using databases such as PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL with keywords and MeSH terms related to \"family presence\", \"resuscitation\", and \"psychological outcomes\". We also checked references and citations of eligible studies using Scopus, and searched for relevant systematic reviews using Epistomonikos. Furthermore, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry for ongoing trials; OpenGrey for grey literature; and Google Scholar for additional trials.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for around 1 year, with one study being a cluster-randomized trial and the other a small pilot study. The studies compared two approaches. In one group, family members were always offered the choice to be present during CPR (CPR is an emergency procedure to restart someone's heart and breathing). In the other group, families were treated in the usual way, which often meant they were not invited to be present. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of PTSD-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are overly complex sentences and technical vocabulary.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences:** Many sentences are built around abstract nouns instead of active verbs, which makes them hard to understand. This is often called 'nominalization'.\n   - **Example:** 'The health condition in question is the psychological and emotional well-being of relatives who witness a resuscitation attempt...'\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is long and abstract. It's difficult for a reader to quickly grasp the main point.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite using simple, active verbs. For example: 'This review looks at the mental and emotional health of family members who witness a resuscitation.'\n\n2. **Define or Replace Technical Terms:** The summary uses medical terms without explaining them, which can alienate readers, especially in the Key Messages.\n   - **Example:** '...the effects of family presence during resuscitation on patient morbidity and mortality are unclear.'\n   - **Problem:** 'Morbidity' and 'mortality' are jargon. A lay reader may not know what they mean.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace the terms or define them simply. For example: '...it is unclear how having family present affects the patient's health, recovery, or survival.'\n\n3. **Reduce Wordiness and Unnecessary Detail:** Some sentences contain details that are not essential for a plain language summary and make the text harder to read.\n   - **Example:** 'We performed a systematic search for studies examining the effects of family presence during resuscitation, using databases such as PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL with keywords and MeSH terms...'\n   - **Problem:** This is too technical. The specific database names and terms like 'MeSH terms' are unnecessary for this audience.\n   - **Suggestion:** Simplify to focus on the action. For example: 'We searched major medical databases for studies that looked at the effects of having family members present during a resuscitation.'\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. The rates of **nominalization** (46 instances), **complex words** (149), and **total nouns** (212) are all well beyond the 90th percentile, confirming the need to simplify sentence structure and vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The summary shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 39% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in key areas of vocabulary and sentence structure. Five metrics are 'Beyond P90', including those for nominalization (46 vs. median <13), complex words (149 vs. median <84), and the SMOG index (15.6 vs. median <12.1), indicating the text is too noun-heavy and uses vocabulary that is too complex for a lay audience."
