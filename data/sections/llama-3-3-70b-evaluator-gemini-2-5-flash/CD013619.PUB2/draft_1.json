  "draft": "# Does allowing family members to be present during a patient's resuscitation (when medical staff are trying to save the patient's life) help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n**Key Messages**\n- Family presence during resuscitation (when medical staff are trying to save a patient's life) does not have enough evidence to support its benefits or harms on relatives’ psychological outcomes, including stress and anxiety (a feeling of worry or nervousness).\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the effects of family presence during resuscitation on patient morbidity (diseases or conditions that affect a patient) and mortality (death rate) are unclear.\n- Future research should focus on conducting sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trials (a type of scientific study that compares the outcomes of two or more groups) to investigate the effects of family presence during resuscitation on relatives’ psychological outcomes and patient care.\n**Introduction**\n### What is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation (FPDR) refers to the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. This practice involves a triangular relationship between the healthcare professionals, the relatives, and the patient and the patient, where the presence of relatives can impact all three groups. FPDR is based on the principle that patients and their relatives often want to be actively involved in treatment decisions, even during critical care situations like resuscitation.\n### Why is family presence during resuscitation a significant issue?\nThe health condition in question is the psychological and emotional well-being of relatives who witness a resuscitation attempt, as well as the potential impact on patient care and healthcare professionals. Relatives who are present during resuscitation may experience post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)‑related symptoms, anxiety, depression, and complicated grief. On the other hand, FPDR may also have benefits, such as improved patient and relative satisfaction, better communication, and more empathetic care. However, there is a need to balance the needs and well‑being of all parties involved.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the effects of offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation on the occurrence of PTSD‑related symptoms, other psychological outcomes, and patient morbidity and mortality. They also the impact of FPDR on medical treatment and care during resuscitation, as well as the personal stress and attitudes of healthcare professionals towards FPDR. The authors sought to synthesize the available evidence from randomized controlled trials to inform practice and policy decisions.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies examining the effects of family presence during resuscitation, using databases such as PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL with keywords and MeSH terms related to \"family presence\", \"resuscitation\", and \"psychological outcomes\".\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nFor each eligible study we extracted data on relatives' psychological outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD) and any reported impact on patient care. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when appropriate, pooled using meta‑analytic techniques.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe applied the GRADE framework to assess our confidence in the evidence, evaluating risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias for each outcome.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for around 1 year, with one study being a cluster-randomized trial and the other a small pilot study. The interventions compared were the systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with the traditional practice. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
