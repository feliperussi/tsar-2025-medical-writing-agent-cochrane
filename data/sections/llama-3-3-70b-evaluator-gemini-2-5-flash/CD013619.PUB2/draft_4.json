  "draft": "Does allowing family members to be present during a patient's resuscitation help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\nKey messages:\n- Family presence during resuscitation does not have enough evidence to support its benefits or harms on relatives' psychological outcomes, including stress and anxiety (a feeling of worry or nervousness).\n- It is unclear how having family present affects the patient's health, recovery, or survival.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to investigate the effects of family presence during resuscitation on relatives' psychological outcomes and patient care.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nWe look at the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. This involves a relationship between healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient, where the presence of relatives can impact all three groups. Patients and their families often want to be involved in treatment decisions, even during critical care situations like resuscitation.\n\nWhy is family presence during resuscitation a significant issue?\nThis review looks at the mental and emotional health of family members who witness a resuscitation. Relatives who are present during resuscitation may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event, anxiety, depression - a mood disorder characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest, and complicated grief. On the other hand, family presence during resuscitation may also have benefits, such as improved patient and relative satisfaction, better communication, and more empathetic care.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what effect offering family members the choice to be present during resuscitation had on them. Specifically, we looked for effects on their mental health, such as PTSD. We also looked at the effects on the patient's health and survival.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies that looked at the effects of having family members present during a resuscitation. We checked references and citations of eligible studies and searched for relevant systematic reviews.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for around 1 year, with one study being a cluster-randomized trial and the other a small pilot study. The interventions compared were the systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with the traditional practice. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of PTSD-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the frequent use of abstract nouns instead of active verbs (a style known as 'nominalization') and complex vocabulary, which makes the text feel dense and difficult to understand. By focusing on using more direct verbs and simpler words, you can make the summary much more accessible. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences less direct. This is the most important change to improve readability.\n   - **Problem:** \"This involves a relationship between healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient, where the presence of relatives can impact all three groups.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The word \"relationship\" is abstract. It's clearer to describe what people are *doing*.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"This means healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient all interact with each other. The relatives' presence can affect everyone involved.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex phrases and technical terms.** Some phrases are unnecessarily formal or complex for a plain language summary.\n   - **Problem:** \"The interventions compared were the systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with the traditional practice.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** \"Systematic offer\" and \"traditional practice\" are vague terms that don't clearly explain what happened in the studies.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"The studies compared two approaches: one where staff always offered relatives the choice to be present for CPR, and another where this was not routinely offered (the usual practice).\"\n\n3. **Make definitions simpler and more integrated.** While it's great that you define terms, the definitions themselves can be simplified.\n   - **Problem:** \"...depression - a mood disorder characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The definition uses clinical language (\"mood disorder characterized by\") which can be simplified.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...depression (feeling very sad and losing interest in things you usually enjoy)...\"\n\nAddressing these points will significantly improve the clarity and readability of your summary for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length (18.8 words) and active voice use are excellent (P75), there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure. Six key metrics fall outside the typical range. Most notably, the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and the text scores in the P90 range for nouns, SMOG index, and the number of complex and long words. This data supports the editorial feedback, indicating that the primary areas for improvement are simplifying vocabulary and converting abstract nouns back into active verbs to make the text more direct and easier to read."
