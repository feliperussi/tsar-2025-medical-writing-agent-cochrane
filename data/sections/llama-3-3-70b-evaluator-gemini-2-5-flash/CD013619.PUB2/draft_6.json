  "draft": "Does allowing family members to be present during a patient's resuscitation help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not have enough evidence to know if allowing family members to be present during resuscitation helps or harms them psychologically, including their stress and anxiety levels.\n- We are also unsure how family presence affects the patient's health and survival.\n- Future studies should investigate how family presence during resuscitation affects family members' psychological well-being and patient care.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation means that relatives are allowed to be with the patient while medical staff are trying to save the patient's life. This usually happens in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. When relatives are present, it can affect the patient, the family, and the healthcare professionals.\n\nWhy is family presence during resuscitation a significant issue?\nWe want to understand how family presence during resuscitation affects the mental and emotional health of family members who witness it. Witnessing a resuscitation can be a traumatic event. Afterwards, family members may experience mental health issues like:\n- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can cause flashbacks or nightmares.\n- Anxiety, which is a strong feeling of worry or fear.\n- Depression, which is feeling very sad and losing interest in things you usually enjoy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how offering family members the choice to be present during resuscitation affects them. Specifically, we looked at the effects on their mental health, such as PTSD. We also looked at the effects on the patient's health and survival.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies that looked at the effects of having family members present during resuscitation. We checked references and citations of eligible studies and searched for relevant systematic reviews.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for around 1 year, with one study being a cluster-randomized trial and the other a small pilot study. The studies compared two approaches: one where staff always offered relatives the choice to be present when a patient's heart stopped and they needed help to restart it (called cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR), and another where this was not routinely offered (the usual practice). Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of PTSD-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, a few key improvements to sentence structure and word choice will make it much easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the long, complex sentence in the results.**\n   - **The sentence:** \"The studies compared two approaches: one where staff always offered relatives the choice to be present when a patient's heart stopped and they needed help to restart it (called cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR), and another where this was not routinely offered (the usual practice).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 48 words, this sentence is very long and tries to do too much at once. It combines the main comparison with a definition of CPR, which can be confusing for readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Break this into shorter, more focused sentences. For example: \"The studies compared two approaches. In the first, staff always offered relatives the choice to be present during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which is when medical staff try to restart a patient's heart. In the second, staff followed the usual practice and did not routinely offer this choice.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).**\n   - **The sentence:** \"Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"no information available\" are indirect and wordy. The linguistic analysis shows a pattern of this throughout the draft, making the text feel less active and more academic.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Use a more direct, active verb. For example: \"The studies did not report their funding sources.\"\n\n3. **Make the key messages more concise.**\n   - **The sentence:** \"We do not have enough evidence to know if allowing family members to be present during resuscitation helps or harms them psychologically, including their stress and anxiety levels.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The main title of the summary already asks specifically about stress and anxiety. Repeating it in the first key message is redundant and makes the sentence longer than necessary.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** You can make this message punchier by removing the repetition: \"We do not have enough evidence to know if allowing family members to be present during resuscitation helps or harms them psychologically.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 72% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in three key areas related to vocabulary and style: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, and both 'nouns' and 'long_words' are in the 90th percentile range. This suggests the text is less direct and uses more complex vocabulary than a typical PLS, which could impact overall readability for a lay audience."
