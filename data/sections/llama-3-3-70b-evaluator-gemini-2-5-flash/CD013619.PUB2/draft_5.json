  "draft": "Does allowing family members to be present during a patient's resuscitation help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not have enough evidence to know if allowing family members to be present during resuscitation helps or harms them psychologically, including their stress and anxiety levels.\n- We are also unsure how family presence affects the patient's health and survival.\n- Future studies should investigate how family presence during resuscitation affects family members' psychological well-being and patient care.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation means that relatives are allowed to be with the patient while medical staff are trying to save the patient's life. This usually happens in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. Healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient all interact with each other, and the relatives' presence can affect everyone involved.\n\nWhy is family presence during resuscitation a significant issue?\nWe want to understand how family presence during resuscitation affects the mental and emotional health of family members who witness it. Family members who are present during resuscitation may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event, anxiety, or depression (feeling very sad and losing interest in things you usually enjoy). On the other hand, family presence during resuscitation may also have benefits, such as improved patient and relative satisfaction, better communication, and more empathetic care.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how offering family members the choice to be present during resuscitation affects them. Specifically, we looked at the effects on their mental health, such as PTSD. We also looked at the effects on the patient's health and survival.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies that looked at the effects of having family members present during resuscitation. We checked references and citations of eligible studies and searched for relevant systematic reviews.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for around 1 year, with one study being a cluster-randomized trial and the other a small pilot study. The studies compared two approaches: one where staff always offered relatives the choice to be present for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and another where this was not routinely offered (the usual practice). Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the included studies. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of PTSD-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are overly complex vocabulary and the use of abstract nouns instead of active verbs, which makes the text feel dense and academic.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use active verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).** This makes your writing more direct and easier to understand. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing an unusually high number of nominalizations.\n   - **For example:** \"Healthcare professionals, relatives, and the patient all interact with each other, and the relatives' presence can affect everyone involved.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The noun 'presence' is less direct than using a verb. The sentence is also wordy.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"When relatives are present, it can affect the patient, the family, and the healthcare professionals.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex terms and definitions.** Some medical terms and explanations are too technical or are grouped together in long, complex sentences. The analysis shows that the number of complex and long words is higher than in typical plain language summaries.\n   - **For example:** \"Family members who are present during resuscitation may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event, anxiety, or depression (feeling very sad and losing a lot of interest in things you usually enjoy).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence introduces three different conditions at once, which can be overwhelming.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Witnessing a resuscitation can be a traumatic event. Afterwards, family members may experience mental health issues like:\n     - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can cause flashbacks or nightmares.\n     - Anxiety, which is a strong feeling of worry or fear.\n     - Depression, which is feeling very sad and losing interest in things you usually enjoy.\"\n\n3. **Explain technical procedures in simpler language.** Instead of just naming a procedure, briefly describe what it is.\n   - **For example:** \"...one where staff always offered relatives the choice to be present for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** While many people have heard of CPR, using the full technical name first is intimidating. A simple description is more helpful.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared two approaches. In one, staff always offered relatives the choice to be present when a patient's heart stopped and they needed help to restart it (called cardiopportunity, or CPR).\"\n\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and use of active voice are good (P25 and P75 respectively), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary and word choice. Six metrics fall into the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. The most significant deviation is in 'nominalization' (BEYOND_P90), showing a heavy reliance on abstract nouns instead of verbs. Metrics for complex words ('smog_index', 'complex_words', 'long_words') are also high (P90), confirming that the vocabulary is too technical for a lay audience."
