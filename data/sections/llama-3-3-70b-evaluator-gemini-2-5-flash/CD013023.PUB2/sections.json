  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of different dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, including standard polyurethane (a type of plastic dressing) and tissue adhesive (a type of glue), bordered polyurethane (a type of plastic dressing with a border), sutureless securement devices (devices that hold the catheter in place without stitches), and integrated securement dressings (dressings that have a built-in securement device), in reducing infection (when germs enter the body and cause harm) and dislodgement (when the catheter is accidentally pulled out) risk are unclear.",
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if one type of dressing or securement device is better than another in preventing complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (infections that occur when germs enter the bloodstream through the catheter) or adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects).",
    "Future research in this area should focus on comparing the effectiveness of different dressings and securement devices, including their potential benefits and harms, and should prioritize studies that are well-designed and large enough to provide reliable results, in order to reduce uncertainty and provide clearer guidance for healthcare professionals."

      "content": "Peripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are small tubes inserted into an artery in the arm or leg to measure blood pressure or take blood samples. They are commonly used in hospitals, especially in intensive care units or during surgery, to closely monitor patients' blood pressure and oxygen levels. However, these catheters can sometimes fail or become dislodged, leading to complications such as infection or bleeding."

      "subheading": "What are the problems associated with peripheral arterial catheters?",
      "content": "Despite their importance, peripheral arterial catheters can fail, requiring reinsertion, and may lead to complications like infection. To prevent these issues, dressings and securement devices are used to maintain the catheter's function and prevent complications."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different dressing and securement devices in preventing the failure and complications of peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalised people. They aimed to compare various products, such as standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, tissue adhesive, and integrated securement dressings, to determine which ones work best in reducing catheter failure, infection, and other adverse events."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found five studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. The studies were conducted in various settings, including anaesthesia and intensive care units, and compared different dressing and securement devices for the stabilisation of arterial catheters. The total duration of the studies is not specified in the abstract. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not reported. The studies compared standard polyurethane (SPU) plus tissue adhesive (TA) with SPU, bordered polyurethane (BPU) with SPU, SPU plus sutureless securement devices (SSD) with SPU, and integrated securement dressings with SPU. No information is available on the funding sources of the studies. The use of different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters may make little or no difference in the risk of catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, or adverse events. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023."
