  "draft": "Do dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters reduce infection and dislodgement risk? We don’t have enough strong evidence to know the benefits and risks of different dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters. These devices include standard polyurethane (a plastic dressing), tissue adhesive (a type of glue), bordered polyurethane (another plastic dressing), sutureless securement devices (which hold the catheter without stitches), and integrated securement dressings (which have a built-in securement device). It is unclear if they reduce the risk of infection (when germs enter the body and cause harm) or dislodgement (when the catheter is accidentally pulled out). We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if one type of dressing or securement device is better than another in preventing complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (infections that occur when germs enter the bloodstream through the catheter) or adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects). Future research in this area should focus on comparing the effectiveness of different dressings and securement devices, including their potential benefits and harms, and should prioritize studies that are well-designed and large enough to provide reliable results, in order to reduce uncertainty and provide clearer guidance for healthcare professionals.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial catheterisation and why is it important? Peripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are small tubes inserted into an artery in the arm or leg to measure blood pressure or take blood samples. They are commonly used in hospitals, especially in intensive care units or during surgery, to closely monitor patients’ blood pressure and oxygen levels. However, these catheters can sometimes fail or become dislodged, leading to complications such as infection or bleeding.\n\nWhat are the problems associated with peripheral arterial catheters? Despite their importance, peripheral arterial catheters can fail, requiring reinsertion, and may lead to complications like infection. To prevent these issues, dressings and securement devices are used to maintain the catheter’s function and prevent complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different dressing and securement devices in preventing the failure and complications of peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalised people. They aimed to compare various products, such as standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, tissue adhesive, and integrated securement dressings, to determine which ones work best in reducing catheter failure, infection, and other adverse events.\n\nHow did we do this review? We searched for studies comparing different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? We found five studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. The studies were conducted in various settings, including anaesthesia and intensive care units, and compared different dressing and securement devices for the stabilisation of arterial catheters. The studies had several limitations. They involved very few participants, and it’s possible that participants knew which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding). Also, the studies were quite different from each other in terms of the people involved and how the treatments were given.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nHow up to date is this review? The evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it is not ready for publication. The language is too complex and academic for a lay audience, which will prevent many readers from understanding the key messages. The main issues are overly long sentences, use of technical jargon without clear explanation, and a reliance on abstract noun phrases instead of simple, direct verbs. To improve the summary, the focus should be on simplifying vocabulary and breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, more digestible ones.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Simplify long, complex sentences.** Many sentences contain multiple ideas, making them hard to follow. Breaking them into shorter sentences will significantly improve clarity.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Future research in this area should focus on comparing the effectiveness of different dressings and securement devices, including their potential benefits and harms, and should prioritize studies that are well-designed and large enough to provide reliable results, in order to reduce uncertainty and provide clearer guidance for healthcare professionals.\"\n    *   **Reason:** This 55-word sentence is too long and complex for a plain language summary.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"Future studies should be larger and better designed. This will help us learn the true benefits and harms of these devices and give clearer advice to healthcare professionals.\"\n\n2.  **Replace technical terms and abstract nouns with simpler language.** The summary uses several terms and noun-heavy phrases that are common in research but confusing for patients.\n    *   **Problem:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\"\n    *   **Reason:** Words like 'heterogeneity', 'participant characteristics', and 'intervention delivery methods' are jargon. This is supported by the very high 'nominalization' score, which indicates an overuse of noun forms instead of active verbs.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"The evidence is not strong for a few reasons. The studies included were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. The studies also differed in the types of people they included and how they gave the treatments.\"\n\n3.  **Use a more direct and active voice.** Some sentences are wordy and could be made more direct and engaging for the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** \"The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different dressing and securement devices in preventing the failure and complications of peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalised people.\"\n    *   **Reason:** This phrasing is indirect. Using 'we' is more personal and aligns with style guidelines.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"We wanted to find out how well different dressings and devices work to stop these catheters from failing or causing problems for people in the hospital.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation results confirm that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, making it difficult for a lay audience to read. Although the word count is within limits, 14 of the 18 linguistic metrics fall outside the typical range for a PLS. The readability scores are a key concern, with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 14.6 and a Gunning Fog Index of 19.9, suggesting a university-level reading ability is required. The vocabulary is also far too complex, as shown by the 'BEYOND_P90' ratings for nominalization (36 instances), complex words (168), and long words (237). These metrics strongly support the need to simplify sentence structure and word choice to improve clarity."
