  "draft": "What are the best dressings and securement devices to prevent complications in people with peripheral arterial catheters (small tubes used to monitor blood and give medicine)?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the best dressings and securement devices to prevent complications in people with peripheral arterial catheters. \n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot conclude whether one type of dressing or securement device is better than another in reducing complications. \n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that compare different dressings and securement devices.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial catheterisation and why is it important?\nPeripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are small tubes inserted into an artery in the arm or leg to collect blood samples or monitor blood pressure in people who are critically ill or undergoing surgery. \nThey are commonly used in intensive care units and operating rooms. \nHowever, these catheters can sometimes become dislodged or blocked, which can lead to serious complications.\n\nWhat are the problems with peripheral arterial catheters?\nDespite their importance, peripheral arterial catheters often fail, requiring reinsertion. \nThis can be due to various reasons such as infection, blockage, or dislodgement. \nThese complications can lead to serious health issues, including infection, bleeding, or nerve damage.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices in preventing complications associated with peripheral arterial catheters. \nThey aimed to compare the effectiveness of various products, including standard polyurethane dressings, bordered polyurethane dressings, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. \nThe studies were conducted in various settings, including anaesthesia and intensive care. \nMost studies compared different dressing and securement devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, and heterogeneity in study populations and intervention delivery methods. \nAll of which increase uncertainty about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's a good start and is generally easy to read. However, it needs a few key improvements before it can be approved. I've focused on the 3 most important changes to improve its completeness and clarity for readers.\n\n1. **CRITICAL ISSUE: Add the missing 'Methods' section.**\nThe summary is missing a section explaining how the review was done. Readers need this context to understand and trust the results. Please add a new section with a question-based heading like 'How did we conduct the review?' and include the simple explanation from the source material: 'We searched for studies comparing different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n2. **CRITICAL ISSUE: Complete the 'Results' section.**\nThe 'What did we find?' section is incomplete. It states the number of studies and people involved but omits the main finding of the review, leaving the reader to guess the outcome.\n- **Problematic text:** \"We found 5 studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. The studies were conducted in various settings, including anaesthesia and intensive care. Most studies compared different dressing and securement devices.\"\n- **Suggested addition:** Please add the main finding to this section. For example: \"...Most studies compared different dressing and securement devices. **We found that using different devices may make little to no difference to the risk of catheter failure, infection, or other problems. However, the evidence is limited, so we need more research to be certain.**\"\n\n3. **CLARITY: Use more direct verbs instead of complex nouns.**\nSome sentences use noun forms of verbs (like 'evaluation' instead of 'evaluate'), which can make them sound formal and less direct. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of these 'nominalizations'.\n- **Problematic text:** \"The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices in preventing complications associated with peripheral arterial catheters.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"**We wanted to find out how well different dressings and securement devices prevent problems with peripheral arterial catheters.**\"\n\nAddressing these three points, especially the two critical content omissions, will make the summary much more complete and useful for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of features falling within the median or best quartile ranges. Readability scores are good. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs) is in the P90 range, indicating the text is less direct than a typical PLS. The suggested improvements focus on addressing this stylistic issue as well as critical content omissions that the metrics do not capture."
