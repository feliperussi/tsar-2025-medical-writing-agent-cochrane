  "draft": "# Can exercise help people with chronic venous insufficiency (a condition where veins have problems returning blood to the heart) manage their symptoms?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether exercise can help people with chronic venous insufficiency (a condition where veins have problems returning blood to the heart, which can lead to symptoms such as swelling, pain, and skin changes) manage their symptoms, and no harmful effects of exercise were reported in the studies.\n- The current evidence does not provide a clear answer to whether exercise improves symptoms or quality of life for people with chronic venous insufficiency, highlighting the need for more research in this area.\n- Future research should focus on investigating the effects of different types of exercise (such as intensity, frequency, and duration) on chronic venous insufficiency symptoms and quality of life, as well as addressing key limitations such as small sample sizes and variability in study methods to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n**Introduction**\n### What is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not work properly, which can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and skin changes. It can also increase the risk of developing venous leg ulcers. CVI is a common problem that can affect people of all ages and can have a significant impact on their quality of life.\n### Why is it important to find effective treatments for chronic venous insufficiency?\nCVI can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, causing pain, discomfort, and mobility problems. Current treatments for CVI include compression stockings, elevation of the legs, and in some cases, surgery. However, these treatments may not be effective for everyone, and some people may experience side effects or complications. Therefore, it is essential to find effective and safe treatments for CVI to improve the quality of life for people with this condition.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether physical exercise programmes are effective in reducing the symptoms of CVI and improving quality of life for people with this condition. They also wanted to assess the potential harms of physical exercise programmes for people with CVI. The authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programmes compared to no exercise or standard treatment for people with non-ulcerated CVI.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies comparing exercise programmes with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n### Inclusion Criteria\nOnly studies that directly compared an exercise programme to no exercise in this patient population were eligible for inclusion.\n### Data Synthesis\nThe results of the included studies were summarized to assess the effects of exercise on outcomes related to chronic venous insufficiency.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the body of evidence using appropriate methodological criteria.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that involved 146 people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. The studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise programme. The exercise protocols differed between studies. The studies were conducted over various durations, with some reporting outcomes at 6 months and others at 8 weeks. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not consistently reported across the studies. The types of interventions and comparisons varied, with different exercise protocols and outcome measures used. Overall, the included studies provided limited information on the main characteristics of the participants, settings, and interventions. It is unclear if physical exercise has an effect on the intensity of signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, or ankle mobility in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. We do not know if physical exercise has an effect on these outcomes.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

Additionally, it exhibits significant clarity and style issues, supported by multiple linguistic metrics indicating deviations from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. The text is generally too complex, with overly long sentences, frequent nominalization, and a high density of complex and long words, making it challenging for a lay audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. While active voice (P75) and pronoun usage (P75) are strong, readability indices such as Flesch Reading Ease (P25) are low, suggesting the text is harder to read. Several grade-level metrics (Automated Readability Index, Gunning Fog Index, LIX, RIX, SMOG Index) are in the P90 or Beyond P90 range, indicating a higher reading level than typical PLS. This is further supported by the average words per sentence (27.78, Beyond P90), which is too high. Vocabulary complexity is also a major concern, with high counts for nominalization (25.00, P90), nouns (232.00, Beyond P90), complex words (159.00, Beyond P90), and long words (258.00, Beyond P90). These deviations collectively point to a text that is less clear, less concise, and more challenging to read than typical PLS documents."
