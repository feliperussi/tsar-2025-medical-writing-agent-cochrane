  "draft": "Can exercise help people with chronic venous insufficiency (a condition where veins have problems returning blood to the heart) manage their symptoms?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if exercise helps people with chronic venous insufficiency manage their symptoms due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show if exercise improves symptoms or quality of life for people with chronic venous insufficiency.\n- Future research should investigate how different types of exercise affect chronic venous insufficiency symptoms and quality of life.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not work properly. This can lead to symptoms like pain, swelling, and skin changes. CVI can increase the risk of developing venous leg ulcers and affects people of all ages, impacting their quality of life.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for chronic venous insufficiency?\nCVI significantly impacts a person's quality of life, causing pain, discomfort, and mobility problems. Current treatments include compression stockings, elevating the legs, and sometimes surgery. However, these may not work for everyone and can have side effects. So, finding effective and safe treatments for CVI is crucial to improve the quality of life for those with this condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know if physical exercise programs reduce CVI symptoms and improve quality of life. They also aimed to assess the potential harms of these programs. The goal was to evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise compared to no exercise or standard treatment for people with non-ulcerated CVI.\n\nHow did the authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing exercise programs with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria?\nOnly studies directly comparing an exercise program to no exercise in this patient population were included.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 5 studies involving 146 people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. These studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise program. The exercise protocols differed, and the studies were conducted over various durations. It is unclear if physical exercise affects the intensity of signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, or ankle mobility in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but requires a few revisions to improve clarity and adhere to style guidelines before approval. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make pronoun use consistent.** The text switches between third-person ('the authors') and first-person ('we'), which can be confusing. The style guide requires using 'we' for the review authors.\n    *   **Example:** 'What did the review authors want to find out? The authors wanted to know...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change this to 'What did we want to find out? We wanted to know...' and apply this change throughout the text.\n\n2. **Simplify the summary of findings.** The results section contains a long, technical list of outcomes that may be difficult for a lay reader to understand.\n    *   **Example:** 'It is unclear if physical exercise affects the intensity of signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, or ankle mobility...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more accessible, for example: 'The studies looked at whether exercise improved symptoms, quality of life, muscle strength, and how well veins pumped blood. For all of these outcomes, the evidence was not clear enough to show a benefit from exercise.'\n\n3. **Improve the 'Methods' subheadings.** The subheadings for the search and inclusion criteria are repetitive, and one is not phrased as a question, which violates the style guide.\n    *   **Example:** 'How did the authors search for evidence? ... What were the inclusion criteria?'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Combine these two short sections under a single, clear question, such as: 'How did we find the evidence?'\n\nSupporting Evidence: The linguistic analysis shows the draft is strong overall. However, the number of long words is higher than typical for a Plain Language Summary (in the 90th percentile). Simplifying the technical terms in the results section, as suggested above, will help address this.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72.2% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability and sentence structure scores are excellent. The primary deviation is the 'long_words' metric, which is in the 90th percentile, suggesting the vocabulary could be simplified where possible to improve reader accessibility."
