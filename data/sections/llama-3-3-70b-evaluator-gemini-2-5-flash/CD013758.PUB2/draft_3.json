  "draft": "Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n\nWe have three key messages:\n- We are unsure if feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula affects undernutrition (when a person does not get enough nutrients), overweight, or obesity because the evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure.\n- Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on adverse events like diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements), vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk) because the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research should focus on the long-term effects of high-protein versus standard-protein formula on infant health, including undernutrition, overweight, obesity, and adverse events, to provide clearer guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is the health problem of protein intake in formula-fed term infants?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth. Some formulas have a high protein content to accelerate weight gain during the first year of life. However, the risk-benefit balance of these formulas is unclear. We need to understand the effects of different protein levels in infant formula on the health of formula-fed term infants.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants. They aimed to find out if feeding healthy term infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has an effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there is a difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing higher and lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. We looked at studies from high-income countries that lasted up to 11 years.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants. The studies compared high-protein formula against standard-protein formula and standard-protein formula against low-protein formula in healthy, formula-fed term infants. Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula. Additionally, feeding healthy infants standard-protein formula compared to low-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with standard-protein formula versus those fed with low-protein formula.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, had very small sample sizes, were likely unblinded, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of unexplained technical terms in the 'Limitations' section, a very long and complex sentence in the 'Aims' section, and a dense, repetitive 'Results' section that is difficult to read. Addressing these three areas will significantly improve the summary's readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain technical terms in the 'Limitations' section.** Readers are unlikely to understand terms like 'heterogeneous' or 'unblinded'. These need to be explained in simple language.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, had very small sample sizes, were likely unblinded, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Heterogeneous populations' and 'unblinded' are research jargon. Readers won't know that 'heterogeneous' means the infants in the studies were very different from each other, or that 'unblinded' means the researchers and parents likely knew which formula the baby was receiving, which could influence the results.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited for several reasons. The groups of infants studied were very different from each other, the studies were small, and in many cases, the researchers and parents likely knew which formula was being used, which could have biased the results. The studies also did not report on all the health outcomes we were interested in.\"\n\n2. **Break up the long, complex sentence in the 'Aims' section.** One sentence currently combines two distinct research questions, making it hard to follow.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"They aimed to find out if feeding healthy term infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has an effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there is a difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This 49-word sentence is too long and complex. It forces the reader to hold two separate ideas in their mind at once.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The review authors wanted to find out two main things. First, does using a high-protein formula instead of a standard one affect an infant's risk of undernutrition, overweight, or obesity? Second, is there a difference in the risk of side effects (like diarrhea or vomiting) between the two types of formula?\"\n\n3. **Make the 'Results' section easier to read.** The main findings are presented in a dense paragraph with a repetitive structure. Using bullet points would make the information much easier to digest.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula. Additionally, feeding healthy infants standard-protein formula compared to low-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with standard-protein formula versus those fed with low-protein formula.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This paragraph repeats the same sentence structure four times, which is monotonous and makes it difficult for readers to distinguish between the different comparisons being made.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our main findings were:\n   - **High-protein vs. standard-protein formula:** We found this may have little to no effect on an infant's risk of undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There was also likely little to no difference in the risk of side effects.\n   - **Standard-protein vs. low-protein formula:** We found this may have little to no effect on an infant's risk of undernutrition. There was also likely little to no difference in the risk of side effects.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has a high number of long words and complex words compared to typical Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with most metrics falling in the median (44.4%) or best quartile (33.3%) ranges. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics are in the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex than 90% of summaries in the corpus. These are 'nouns' (183), 'lix' (59.14), 'complex_words_dc' (225), and 'long_words' (207). This statistical evidence supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical jargon and replace long, complex words with more common alternatives to improve readability."
