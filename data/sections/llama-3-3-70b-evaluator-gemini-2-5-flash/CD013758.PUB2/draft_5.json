  "draft": "Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n\nWe have three key messages:\n- We are unsure if feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula affects undernutrition (when a person does not get enough nutrients), overweight, or obesity because the evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure.\n- Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on adverse events like diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements), vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk) because the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research should focus on the long-term effects of high-protein versus standard-protein formula on infant health, including undernutrition, overweight, obesity, and adverse events, to provide clearer guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\n\nWhy is the amount of protein in baby formula important?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth. Some formulas have a high protein content to accelerate weight gain during the first year of life. However, the risk-benefit balance of these formulas is unclear. We need to understand the effects of different protein levels in infant formula on the health of formula-fed term infants.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a high-protein formula instead of a standard one affects a healthy infant's risk of:\n- undernutrition, overweight, or obesity\n- side effects like diarrhea or vomiting\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing higher and lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. We looked at studies from high-income countries that lasted up to 11 years.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main findings were:\n- High-protein vs. standard-protein formula: We are not sure if using this formula affects an infant's risk of undernutrition, overweight, or obesity because the evidence was not strong enough. For side effects, there may be little to no difference between the formulas.\n- Standard-protein vs. low-protein formula: We found this may have little to no effect on an infant's risk of undernutrition. There was also likely little to no difference in the risk of side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons. The groups of infants studied were very different from each other, the studies were small, and in many cases, the researchers and parents likely knew which formula was being used, which could have biased the results. The studies also did not report on all the health outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity for the reader before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break up the overly long sentence in the 'Limitations' section.** This sentence is difficult to follow because it combines four distinct ideas.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited for several reasons. The groups of infants studied were very different from each other, the studies were small, and in many cases, the researchers and parents likely knew which formula was being used, which could have biased the results.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 39 words, this sentence forces readers to hold too much information in their head at once. Breaking it up makes the limitations much clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited for several reasons:\\n    - The groups of infants in the studies were very different from each other.\\n    - The studies were small.\\n    - In many cases, researchers and parents likely knew which formula was being used, which could have biased the results.\"\n\n2. **Simplify a technical phrase in the introduction.** The term 'risk-benefit balance' may not be clear to all readers.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"However, the risk-benefit balance of these formulas is unclear.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a common phrase in research but can be simplified for a lay audience.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, it is unclear if the benefits of these formulas outweigh the potential risks.\"\n\n3. **Make the phrasing for 'uncertainty' consistent in the key messages.** Using slightly different wording for the same concept can be confusing.\n   - **Original phrases:** \"...because the evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure\" and \"...because the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This minor inconsistency can make readers wonder if there is a subtle difference in meaning. Using one clear, consistent reason for the uncertainty is better.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** In both key messages, use a consistent phrase like, \"...because of a lack of strong evidence.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, showing the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 67% of metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and style, with all scores being within acceptable ranges. The average sentence length of 20.65 words is good, but this overall score masks the presence of a few specific sentences that are too long (e.g., 39 words) and negatively impact clarity. Addressing these specific sentences as noted in the feedback will resolve the main readability issue."
