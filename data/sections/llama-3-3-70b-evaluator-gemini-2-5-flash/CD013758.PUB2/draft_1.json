  "draft": "# Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n**Key Messages**\n- We are unsure if feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has an effect on undernutrition: undernutrition (when a person does not get enough nutrients), overweight, or obesity, due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little or no effect on the occurrence of adverse events such as diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements), vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk), but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research in this area should focus on the long-term effects of high-protein versus standard-protein formula on infant health, including undernutrition, overweight, obesity, and adverse events, to provide clearer guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the health problem of protein intake in formula-fed term infants?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth, and some formulas have a high protein content to accelerate weight gain during the first year of life. However, the risk-benefit balance of these formulas is unclear, and it is important to understand the effects of different protein levels in infant formula on the health of formula-fed term infants.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants. They aimed to find out if feeding healthy term infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has an effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there is a difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies comparing higher and lower protein intake in formula‑fed term infants.\n### Data Synthesis\nWe summarized and combined the results of the identified studies using appropriate meta‑analysis methods.\n### Evidence Assessment\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of different protein levels.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants. The studies were conducted in high-income countries and lasted for up to 11 years. The included studies compared high-protein formula against standard-protein formula, and standard-protein formula against low-protein formula, in healthy, formula-fed term infants. The population characteristics included infants of any sex or ethnicity who were fed infant formula for at least three consecutive months at any time from birth. No information on study funding sources was provided. Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula. Feeding healthy infants standard-protein formula compared to low-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with standard-protein formula versus those fed with low-protein formula.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, had very small sample sizes, were likely unblinded, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

Additionally, the text contains multiple long, complex sentences and an overuse of passive voice and nominalizations, which significantly reduce readability for a lay audience. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows significant deviations from typical Plain Language Summary patterns in sentence length, passive voice, noun count, and vocabulary complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the word count limit. However, the linguistic analysis indicates moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 9 out of 18 features deviating from the typical ranges. Notably, the text shows significant deviations in sentence length (words_per_sentence at P90), passive voice (BEYOND_P90), nominalization (P90), noun count (BEYOND_P90), and overall vocabulary complexity (complex_words_dc, complex_words, long_words, lix, rix all at P90 or BEYOND_P90). These deviations suggest the text is harder to read and less direct than typical Plain Language Summaries."
