  "draft": "Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n\nWe have three key messages:\n- We are unsure if high-protein formula affects undernutrition, overweight, or obesity in healthy infants due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- High-protein formula may have little to no effect on adverse events like diarrhea, vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity, but the evidence is not strong.\n- Future research should focus on the long-term effects of high-protein versus standard-protein formula on infant health.\n\nWhat is the health problem of protein intake in formula-fed term infants?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth. Some formulas have high protein content to accelerate weight gain. However, the risk-benefit balance of these formulas is unclear. We need to understand the effects of different protein levels in infant formula on the health of formula-fed term infants.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants. They aimed to find out if feeding healthy term infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula affects undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there is a difference in the risk of adverse effects.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing higher and lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. We looked at studies from high-income countries that lasted up to 11 years.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants. The studies compared high-protein formula against standard-protein formula and standard-protein formula against low-protein formula in healthy, formula-fed term infants. Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, had very small sample sizes, were likely unblinded, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is NOT_APPROVED. While the readability scores are excellent, there are critical issues with content accuracy and clarity that must be addressed before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Missing Key Findings:** The 'What did the review authors find?' section omits the results for the 'standard-protein versus low-protein formula' comparison. This is a major factual omission that makes the summary incomplete and misleading.\n    - **Suggestion:** Restructure the results section to clearly present findings for both comparisons mentioned in the source material: 'high-protein vs. standard-protein' and 'standard-protein vs. low-protein' formulas.\n\n2. **Undefined Technical Terms:** The summary uses terms like 'undernutrition' and 'milk hypersensitivity' without providing the simple definitions that were included in the source material. This makes the text harder for a lay audience to understand.\n    - **Quote:** \"...affects undernutrition, overweight, or obesity...\" and \"...diarrhea, vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity...\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Add the simple parenthetical definitions from the source text, for example: 'undernutrition (when a person does not get enough nutrients)' and 'milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk)'.\n\n3. **Vague Wording in Key Messages:** The reasons for uncertainty are stated with phrases like 'lack of robust evidence' and 'the evidence is not strong'. This language is slightly jargony and could be made more direct for readers.\n    - **Quote:** \"...due to a lack of robust evidence.\" and \"...but the evidence is not strong.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Rephrase to be more direct and consistent, for example: \"We are uncertain because the evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure.\" or \"...because the evidence is of low quality.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.33) and Words Per Sentence (17.57) are excellent, indicating the text is structurally simple and easy to read. However, these strong statistical results do not reflect the critical content issues, such as the omission of key findings and the use of undefined technical terms, which significantly impact the summary's overall clarity and accuracy."
