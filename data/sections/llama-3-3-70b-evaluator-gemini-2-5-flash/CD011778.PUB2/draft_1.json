  "draft": "# Is using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n**Key Messages**\n- Using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning may have some benefits for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it is better than deep cleaning alone, and any benefits may be too small to be clinically important (clinically important means the difference is large enough to be noticed by patients).\n- The current evidence does not show any harmful effects from using light therapy, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects, especially for people with infections around dental implants, as there is very little evidence available for this group.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects over longer periods of time and in different patient groups.\n**Introduction**\n### What are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They aimed to compare the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### Reason for Termination\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without producing a final answer.\n### Next Steps\nConsider increasing the iteration limit, simplifying the task, or breaking it into smaller sub‑tasks.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because many studies were unblinded, lacked complete outcome data, involved heterogeneous populations and delivery methods, and had very small sample sizes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

Additionally, several subheadings do not follow the required question format, and the overall readability is significantly lower than typical Plain Language Summaries, characterized by overly long and complex sentences and vocabulary.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Missing Results Section:** The 'Results' section is entirely absent, replaced by an agent error message. This is a critical omission of the review's core findings, rendering the summary incomplete and uninformative.\n2.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, violating the 'MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE'.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Complete the Results Section:** The most urgent improvement is to populate the 'Results' section with the actual findings of the review, including the number of studies, the certainty of the evidence, and the main conclusions regarding the effectiveness of adjunctive aPDT, as detailed in the 'ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT'.\n2.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity:** Many sentences are excessively long and contain complex clauses, making them difficult for a lay audience to follow.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is 35 words long and combines two complex descriptions with technical terms, making it very challenging to understand.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"If not treated, periodontitis slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Peri-implant diseases affect the tissues around dental implants, causing inflammation and bone loss.\"\n3.  **Simplify Vocabulary and Reduce Nominalization:** The text frequently uses technical terms and noun-form verbs that could be replaced with simpler, more direct language.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults.\"\n    *   **Problem:** Phrases like \"assess the effects of using\" are wordy and use nominalization. \"Adjunctive treatment\" and \"subgingival instrumentation\" are technical terms that, while defined, contribute to the overall complexity.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) works when added to deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation or SI) for adults with gum disease and infections around dental implants.\"\n4.  **Reformat Subheadings as Questions:** Adhere to the style guide by rephrasing subheadings as questions.\n    *   **Quote:** \"### Methods\", \"### Limitations\", \"### Currency\"\n    *   **Problem:** These subheadings are not phrased as questions, which goes against the 'MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE'.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        *   \"### How did we do the review?\"\n        *   \"### What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   \"### How up to date is this review?\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Only 33.3% of features fall within the best quartile, and 38.9% are beyond the 90th percentile, suggesting substantial readability issues. Key metrics showing significant deviation include:\n-   **Readability Indices:** Flesch Reading Ease (25.99, P10), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (18.47, BEYOND_P90), Automated Readability Index (20.56, BEYOND_P90), Gunning Fog Index (22.90, BEYOND_P90), LIX (71.92, BEYOND_P90), RIX (12.93, BEYOND_P90), and Dale-Chall Readability (8.74, BEYOND_P90) all indicate the text is much harder to read than typical PLS documents.\n-   **Sentence Structure:** Words per sentence (35.57, BEYOND_P90) is significantly higher than typical, confirming that sentences are too long.\n-   **Vocabulary Complexity:** Complex words (Dale-Chall) (220.00, P90), Long words (181.00, P90), and Nominalization (21.00, P90) are all higher than typical, indicating an overuse of unfamiliar, lengthy, and noun-form words. These metric deviations strongly support the need for simplification in sentence structure and vocabulary to improve clarity and readability for patients."
