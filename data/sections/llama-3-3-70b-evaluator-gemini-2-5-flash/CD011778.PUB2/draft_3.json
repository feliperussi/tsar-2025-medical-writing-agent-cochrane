  "draft": "Is using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n\nKey Messages\n- Adding light therapy to deep cleaning may offer small benefits for gum disease. However, the evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain. Any benefits are likely too small for patients to notice a difference.\n- The current evidence does not show any harmful effects from using light therapy, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects, especially for people with infections around dental implants, as there is very little evidence available for this group.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects over longer periods of time and in different patient groups.\n\nWhat are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. If not treated, periodontitis slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Peri-implant diseases affect the tissues around dental implants, causing inflammation and bone loss. To treat these conditions, dentists often clean the pockets around the teeth, help patients improve their brushing and flossing, advise them on risks like smoking, and sometimes perform surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) works when added to deep cleaning for adults with gum disease and infections around dental implants. We compared the outcomes of deep cleaning with adjunctive aPDT versus deep cleaning alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on key signs of gum health, like how deep the pockets around the teeth were, how much the gums bled, and how well the gums were attached to the teeth. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 50 randomised controlled trials with 1407 participants. Most studies used a split-mouth study design; only 18 studies used a parallel-group design.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe are very uncertain whether adding aPDT to deep cleaning leads to improvement in any clinical outcomes at six months when compared to deep cleaning alone. The evidence suggests that any improvements may be too small to be clinically important. We found no studies including people with peri-implantitis, and only one study including people with peri-implant mucositis, but this very small study reported no data at six months.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because many studies were unblinded, lacked complete outcome data, involved heterogeneous populations and delivery methods, and had very small sample sizes. The certainty of the evidence is very low, and we cannot be sure if adjunctive aPDT leads to improved clinical outcomes during the active or supportive treatment of periodontitis.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024. We will continue to monitor new research and update the review as necessary. Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and structure. However, it is not yet ready for publication because it uses several technical terms and complex phrases that will be difficult for a lay audience to understand. The main areas for improvement are simplifying the vocabulary and explaining research concepts in plain language.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain or remove technical research terms.** The summary mentions research designs and limitations using jargon that is not explained.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Most studies used a split-mouth study design; only 18 studies used a parallel-group design.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Patients won't know what 'split-mouth' or 'parallel-group' means. This detail isn't essential, but if included, it needs a simple explanation.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In most studies, dentists treated one side of a person's mouth with light therapy and the other side without it to compare the results. In other studies, one group of people received the light therapy and another group did not.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and formal language.** Some sentences use clinical language when simpler, more direct words would be clearer.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Periodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Chronic inflammatory conditions\" is medical jargon. While accurate, it's less accessible than describing the problem in everyday terms.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Gum disease (periodontitis) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases) are long-term conditions that cause swelling and damage in the mouth.\"\n\n3. **Make the 'Limitations' section more meaningful.** The limitations are listed as a series of technical flaws without explaining why they matter to the reader.\n   - **Original Text:** \"The evidence is limited because many studies were unblinded, lacked complete outcome data, involved heterogeneous populations and delivery methods, and had very small sample sizes.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'unblinded' and 'heterogeneous populations' are unclear. The reader needs to understand how these issues affect our confidence in the results.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. In many studies, the dental team knew which treatment patients were getting, which could have biased the results. Many studies were also very small, and the way light therapy was used varied between them, making the results less certain.\"\n\nThese changes will make the summary much easier for patients and the public to read and understand. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that the draft uses more long words and unfamiliar words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling in the median or best quartile ranges. However, three vocabulary-related metrics deviate significantly from the norm (P90 range): 'nouns' (162), 'complex_words_dc' (246), and 'long_words' (187). This indicates that while sentence structure is good, the choice of words is often too complex or formal for a lay audience, supporting the need for vocabulary simplification."
