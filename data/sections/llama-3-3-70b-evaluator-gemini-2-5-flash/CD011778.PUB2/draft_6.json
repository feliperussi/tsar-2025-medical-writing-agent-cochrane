  "draft": "Is using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n\nKey Messages\n- For people with gum disease, adding light therapy to deep cleaning might provide small benefits, but the evidence we found is very uncertain.\n- The current evidence does not show any harmful effects from using light therapy, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects, especially for people with infections around dental implants, as there is very little evidence available for this group.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies to provide clearer evidence on this treatment.\n\nWhat are gum disease and infections around dental implants?\nGum disease (periodontitis) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases) are long-term conditions that cause swelling and damage in the mouth. If not treated, both conditions can slowly damage the gums and bone that hold teeth or implants in place. To treat these conditions, dentists often clean the pockets around the teeth or implants, help patients improve their brushing and flossing, advise them on risks like smoking, and sometimes perform surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well light therapy works when added to deep cleaning for adults with gum disease and infections around dental implants. We compared the outcomes of deep cleaning with light therapy versus deep cleaning alone or with placebo light therapy, focusing on key signs of gum health, like how deep the pockets around the teeth were, how much the gums bled, and how well the gums were attached to the teeth. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing light therapy with standard treatment for gum disease and infections around dental implants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 50 studies with 1407 participants. In most studies, dentists treated one side of a person's mouth with light therapy and the other side without it to compare the results. In other studies, one group of people received the light therapy and another group did not.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nAfter six months, we are very uncertain if adding light therapy improves gum health more than deep cleaning by itself. The evidence suggests that any improvements may be too small to be clinically important. We found no studies including people with infections around dental implants that reported results at six months.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. In many studies, the dental team knew which treatment patients were getting. This knowledge could have unintentionally influenced how they measured the results. Many studies were also very small, and the way light therapy was used varied between them, making the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024. We will continue to monitor new research and update the review as necessary. Future research should focus on large, well-designed studies to provide clearer evidence on this treatment.",

However, it is not approved because 3 specific improvements are needed to maximize clarity and precision for the reader. 1. The first key message slightly misrepresents the review's main finding. Phrasing it as 'might provide small benefits' is less accurate than the original conclusion that any benefits are likely 'too small to be clinically important'. 2. The term 'placebo light therapy' is introduced without any explanation, which could confuse a lay reader. This term should be briefly defined or removed for simplicity. 3. The call for future research is stated verbatim in both the 'Key Messages' and the final 'Currency' section. This repetition should be removed from the 'Currency' section to improve conciseness.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 77.8% of metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, indicating excellent structural and vocabulary choices. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (10.4) and low use of passive voice (9 instances) are in the top 25% of PLS texts, making the summary easy to read. All other metrics are within the median range, with no statistical deviations noted. The suggested edits focus on nuanced content clarity rather than fixing broad metric-based issues."
