  "draft": "Is using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n\nKey Messages\n- Using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning may have some benefits for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it is better than deep cleaning alone, and any benefits may be too small to be clinically important (clinically important means the difference is large enough to be noticed by patients).\n- The current evidence does not show any harmful effects from using light therapy, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects, especially for people with infections around dental implants, as there is very little evidence available for this group.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects over longer periods of time and in different patient groups.\n\nWhat are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. If not treated, periodontitis slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Peri-implant diseases affect the tissues around dental implants, causing inflammation and bone loss. Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) works when added to deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation or SI) for adults with gum disease and infections around dental implants. We compared the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 50 randomised controlled trials with 1407 participants. Most studies used a split-mouth study design; only 18 studies used a parallel-group design.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe are very uncertain whether adjunctive aPDT during active treatment of periodontitis leads to improvement in any clinical outcomes at six months when compared to SI alone. The evidence suggests that any improvements may be too small to be clinically important. We found no studies including people with peri-implantitis, and only one study including people with peri-implant mucositis, but this very small study reported no data at six months.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because many studies were unblinded, lacked complete outcome data, involved heterogeneous populations and delivery methods, and had very small sample sizes. The certainty of the evidence is very low, and we cannot be sure if adjunctive aPDT leads to improved clinical outcomes during the active or supportive treatment of periodontitis.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024. We will continue to monitor new research and update the review as necessary. Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants.",

However, the language is too complex for a lay audience, making it difficult to understand the key takeaways. The main issues are overly long sentences and unexplained technical terms. Focusing on simplifying these will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break up long sentences to improve clarity.** The first key message is 49 words long and contains multiple clauses, which can overwhelm readers.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning may have some benefits for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it is better than deep cleaning alone, and any benefits may be too small to be clinically important (clinically important means the difference is large enough to be noticed by patients).\"\n   - **Problem:** This single sentence combines the intervention, the potential benefit, the lack of evidence, the uncertainty, the small effect size, and a definition. It's too much information to process at once.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Adding light therapy to a deep cleaning *may* offer small benefits for gum disease. However, the evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain. Any benefits are likely too small for patients to notice a difference.\"\n\n2. **Explain technical medical terms in simple language.** The summary lists several clinical outcomes without explaining what they mean for a patient's health.\n   - **Original Text:** \"...focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\"\n   - **Problem:** Patients are unlikely to know what 'probing pocket depth' or 'clinical attachment level' are, making it hard to understand what the review actually measured.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...we focused on key signs of gum health, like how deep the pockets around the teeth were, how much the gums bled, and how well the gums were attached to the teeth. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\"\n\n3. **Use stronger, more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** Some sentences are written in a passive, academic style that can be simplified.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions.\"\n   - **Problem:** The sentence is built around a list of noun phrases ('improving', 'controlling', 'interventions'), which feels static. Using active verbs makes it more direct and easier to read.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To treat these conditions, dentists often clean the pockets around the teeth, help patients improve their brushing and flossing, advise them on risks like smoking, and sometimes perform surgery.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation results confirm that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 10 of 18 metrics falling into the P90 range or beyond. The primary issues are related to sentence and word complexity. Key metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (25.0), 'long_words' (209), and 'complex_words' (131) are all in the highest percentiles, indicating sentences are too long and use difficult vocabulary. This is reflected in the high-grade-level readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 14.4), making the text challenging for a general audience."
