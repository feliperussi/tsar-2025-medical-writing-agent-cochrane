  "draft": "Is using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n\nKey Messages\n- Adding light therapy to deep cleaning may offer small benefits for gum disease. However, the evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain. Any benefits are likely too small for patients to notice a difference.\n- The current evidence does not show any harmful effects from using light therapy, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects, especially for people with infections around dental implants, as there is very little evidence available for this group.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects over longer periods of time and in different patient groups.\n\nWhat are gum disease and infections around dental implants?\nGum disease (periodontitis) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases) are long-term conditions that cause swelling and damage in the mouth. If not treated, gum disease slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Infections around dental implants cause inflammation and bone loss around the implant. To treat these conditions, dentists often clean the pockets around the teeth or implants, help patients improve their brushing and flossing, advise them on risks like smoking, and sometimes perform surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well light therapy works when added to deep cleaning for adults with gum disease and infections around dental implants. We compared the outcomes of deep cleaning with light therapy versus deep cleaning alone or with placebo light therapy, focusing on key signs of gum health, like how deep the pockets around the teeth were, how much the gums bled, and how well the gums were attached to the teeth. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing light therapy with standard treatment for gum disease and infections around dental implants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 50 studies with 1407 participants. In most studies, dentists treated one side of a person's mouth with light therapy and the other side without it to compare the results. In other studies, one group of people received the light therapy and another group did not.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe are very uncertain whether adding light therapy to deep cleaning leads to improvement in any clinical outcomes at six months when compared to deep cleaning alone. The evidence suggests that any improvements may be too small to be clinically important. We found no studies including people with infections around dental implants that reported results at six months.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. In many studies, the dental team knew which treatment patients were getting, which could have biased the results. Many studies were also very small, and the way light therapy was used varied between them, making the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024. We will continue to monitor new research and update the review as necessary. Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's a solid start and passes all our critical checks for completeness and accuracy. I have 3 main suggestions to make it even clearer and more accessible for patients.\n\n1. **Simplify technical descriptions and define clinical terms.** Some descriptions are a bit clinical and could be more direct for a lay audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"If not treated, gum disease slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Infections around dental implants cause inflammation and bone loss around the implant.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Structures that hold teeth in place\" is abstract. \"Inflammation\" is a common but important term that benefits from a simple definition.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"If not treated, gum disease slowly damages the gums and bone that hold teeth in place. Infections around dental implants cause swelling (inflammation) and damage to the bone around the implant.\"\n\n2. **Explain research jargon instead of just stating it.** Terms that are common in research can be confusing for patients.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"In many studies, the dental team knew which treatment patients were getting, which could have biased the results.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term \"biased the results\" doesn't explain *how* the results were affected.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In many studies, the dental team knew which treatment patients were getting. This knowledge could have unintentionally influenced how they measured the results.\"\n\n3. **Avoid repeating long, complex sentences.** The summary uses the same 49-word sentence in two different sections, which makes the text feel dense and repetitive.\n   - **Original sentence (appears in Key Messages and at the end):** \"Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more certain evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects over longer periods of time and in different patient groups.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Repeating a long sentence verbatim is unnecessary. The final section should be a concise conclusion.\n   - **Suggested rewrite (for the final sentence of the summary):** \"Future research should focus on large, well-designed studies to provide clearer evidence on this treatment.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help address the high number of long and complex words noted in the linguistic analysis, improving readability for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 50% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis identified significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The counts for nouns (176), Dale-Chall complex words (232), and long words (185) are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more dense and uses more unfamiliar vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and jargon."
