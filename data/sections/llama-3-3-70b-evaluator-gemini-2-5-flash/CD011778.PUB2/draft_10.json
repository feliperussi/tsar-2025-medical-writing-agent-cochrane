  "draft": "Is using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n\nKey messages:\n- Light therapy uses light to kill bacteria. When added to deep cleaning, it might offer some benefits for gum disease and dental implant infections. However, we lack strong evidence to say if it's better than deep cleaning alone. Any benefits might also be too small to make a real difference to patients (this is what 'clinically important' means).\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers about the effectiveness of light therapy for these conditions, partly because most studies were small and had methodological limitations (methodological limitations refer to problems in the way the studies were designed or conducted that can affect the reliability of the results), and no studies reported on patient satisfaction or quality of life (quality of life refers to a person's overall well-being, including their physical, emotional, and social health).\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of light therapy for gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects on patient satisfaction and quality of life, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about treatment options.\n\nWhat are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. If not treated, periodontitis slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Peri-implant diseases cause swelling around dental implants, which can lead to bone loss. Doctors can treat these problems by helping people improve their oral hygiene, manage risks like smoking, and sometimes perform surgery. The usual non-surgical treatment involves a deep cleaning to remove bacteria from below the gum line.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They compared the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes like probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe included 50 studies with 1407 participants. Most studies used a split-mouth study design; only 18 studies used a parallel-group design. Studies were small, ranging from 10 participants to 88. Adjunctive aPDT was given in a single session in 39 studies, in multiple sessions (between two and four sessions) in 11 studies, and one study included both single and multiple sessions. We are very uncertain whether adjunctive aPDT during active treatment of periodontitis leads to improvement in any clinical outcomes at six months when compared to SI alone. Any apparent differences between adjunctive aPDT and SI alone were not judged to be clinically important. Twenty-four studies (639 participants) observed no adverse effects related to aPDT. No studies reported pocket closure at six months, participant satisfaction, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias), the studies were very small, and they involved different types of participants or used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, to make it clearer and more accessible for patients, I recommend focusing on three key areas before approval.\n\n1. **Simplify technical language and maintain a consistent tone.** The summary starts well with plain terms like 'light therapy' and 'deep cleaning', but some sections switch to technical language that can be confusing for readers. Using 'we' consistently for the review authors will also make it more direct and easier to follow.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if using light therapy (aPDT) after a deep cleaning (SI) is better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease in adults.\"\n\n2. **Use stronger verbs instead of complex noun phrases.** Some sentences are long and rely on abstract nouns, which makes them harder to understand. Rewriting them with more direct verbs will improve clarity.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of light therapy... to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about treatment options.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Future research should use large, well-designed studies to get more reliable evidence. This will help doctors and patients decide on the best treatment.\"\n\n3. **Streamline in-line definitions.** The parenthetical definitions are a bit repetitive and clunky. They can be integrated more smoothly into the sentences.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...most studies were small and had methodological limitations (methodological limitations refer to problems in the way the studies were designed or conducted that can affect the reliability of the results)...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...most studies were small and had problems in their design or how they were conducted, which can affect how reliable the results are.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the text has a high number of long, complex words and noun-heavy phrases compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and voice are within acceptable ranges, vocabulary complexity metrics are high. The draft is in the 90th percentile or beyond for `long_words`, `complex_words`, `complex_words_dc`, `smog_index`, `nominalization`, and `nouns`, indicating the language is more technical and less direct than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
