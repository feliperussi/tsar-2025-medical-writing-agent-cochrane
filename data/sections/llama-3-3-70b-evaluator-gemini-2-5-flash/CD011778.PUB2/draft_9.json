  "draft": "# Is using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning better than deep cleaning alone for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants?\n**Key Messages**\n- Using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning may have some benefits for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it is better than deep cleaning alone, and any benefits may be too small to be clinically important (clinically important means the difference is large enough to be noticeable and to make a real difference to patients).\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers about the effectiveness of light therapy for these conditions, partly because most studies were small and had methodological limitations (methodological limitations refer to problems in the way the studies were designed or conducted that can affect the reliability of the results), and no studies reported on patient satisfaction or quality of life (quality of life refers to a person's overall well-being, including their physical, emotional, and social health).\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of light therapy for gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects on patient satisfaction and quality of life, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about treatment options.\n**Introduction**\n### What are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases cause inflammation in the tissues around dental implants, leading to the loss of supporting bone. These conditions can be treated with methods such as improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors like smoking, and surgical interventions. Standard non-surgical treatment typically involves removing the subgingival biofilm using subgingival instrumentation.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They compared the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes like probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### Cause of Termination\nThe agent stopped because it exceeded the maximum allowed iterations, which is a safeguard to prevent infinite loops.\n### Next Steps\nYou can restart the process, increase the iteration limit, or adjust the task to avoid hitting the limit.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias), the studies were very small, and they involved different types of participants or used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues and significant deviations from Plain Language Summary guidelines. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Missing and Incorrect Results Section:** The 'Results' section contains an internal error message ('Cause of Termination', 'Next Steps') instead of the actual findings of the review. This is a critical omission of the most important information for readers and a factual inaccuracy.\n2.  **Subheading Format:** Most subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Populate the 'Results' Section with Actual Findings:**\n    *   **Problem:** The current 'Results' section is an error message and provides no information about the review's findings. This leaves the reader completely uninformed about the study's conclusions.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** The 'Results' section must be completely rewritten to summarize the main findings from the `ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT` and `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH`. It should clearly state the number of studies and participants, the very low certainty of the evidence, and the lack of clinically important benefits for adjunctive aPDT, as well as any reported adverse effects. For example, it could start with a subheading like 'What did the review find?' and then explain the main outcomes.\n\n2.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning may have some benefits for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it is better than deep cleaning alone, and any benefits may be too small to be clinically important (clinically important means the difference is large enough to be noticeable and to make a real difference to patients).\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is 59 words long, making it extremely difficult to read and comprehend for a lay audience. The embedded definition further complicates it. The `words_per_sentence` metric (37.33) is significantly beyond typical PLS patterns.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Light therapy uses light to kill bacteria. When added to deep cleaning, it might offer some benefits for gum disease and dental implant infections. However, we lack strong evidence to say if it's better than deep cleaning alone. Any benefits might also be too small to make a real difference to patients (this is what 'clinically important' means).\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Technical Jargon and Noun-Heavy Phrases:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases cause inflammation in the tissues around dental implants, leading to the loss of supporting bone. These conditions can be treated with methods such as improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors like smoking, and surgical interventions. Standard non-surgical treatment typically involves removing the subgingival biofilm using subgingival instrumentation.\"\n    *   **Problem:** Phrases like \"tooth-supporting apparatus,\" \"subgingival biofilm,\" and \"subgingival instrumentation\" are technical and not easily understood by a general audience. The text is also quite noun-heavy, which reduces readability. Metrics for `nominalization`, `nouns`, `complex_words`, and `long_words` are all in the P90/Beyond P90 range.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"If not treated, periodontitis slowly damages the structures that hold teeth in place. Peri-implant diseases cause swelling around dental implants, which can lead to bone loss. Doctors can treat these problems by helping people improve their oral hygiene, manage risks like smoking, and sometimes perform surgery. The usual non-surgical treatment involves a deep cleaning to remove bacteria from below the gum line.\"\n\n4.  **Reformat Subheadings as Questions:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"\n    *   **Problem:** These subheadings do not follow the Master Style Guide's requirement to be phrased as questions.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        *   \"Methods\" → \"How did the review authors find the evidence?\"\n        *   \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   \"Currency\" → \"How up to date is this review?\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The PLS evaluation results strongly support the need for these improvements. The text significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with only 11.1% of features in the best quartile and 38.9% beyond the 90th percentile. Specifically, the `words_per_sentence` (37.33, BEYOND_P90) highlights the issue with long sentences. All readability indices (`flesch_kincaid_grade` 19.22, `automated_readability_index` 21.43, `gunning_fog_index` 24.08, `flesch_reading_ease` 23.76) indicate the text is much harder to read than typical PLS, requiring a significantly higher education level. Furthermore, high `nominalization` (27.00, P90), `nouns` (160.00, P90), `complex_words_dc` (246.00, P90), `complex_words` (128.00, P90), and `long_words` (206.00, P90) confirm the need to simplify vocabulary and reduce noun-heavy constructions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Only 11.1% of features fall within the best quartile, while 38.9% are beyond the 90th percentile and 5.6% are below the 10th percentile. Key areas of deviation include sentence length (average 37.33 words per sentence, far exceeding the median of <22.1), and overall readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 19.22, significantly higher than the median of <13.2). Vocabulary complexity is also high, with elevated counts for nominalization, nouns, complex words, and long words, all falling into the P90 or Beyond P90 ranges. This suggests the text is much harder to read and understand for a lay audience than typical PLS documents."
