  "key_messages": [
    "Using light therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill bacteria) in addition to deep cleaning may have some benefits for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it is better than deep cleaning alone, and any benefits may be too small to be clinically important (clinically important means the difference is large enough to be noticeable and to make a real difference to patients).",
    "The current evidence does not provide clear answers about the effectiveness of light therapy for these conditions, partly because most studies were small and had methodological limitations (methodological limitations refer to problems in the way the studies were designed or conducted that can affect the reliability of the results), and no studies reported on patient satisfaction or quality of life (quality of life refers to a person's overall well-being, including their physical, emotional, and social health).",
    "Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of light therapy for gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects on patient satisfaction and quality of life, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about treatment options."

      "subheading": "What are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?",
      "content": "Periodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases cause inflammation in the tissues around dental implants, leading to the loss of supporting bone. These conditions can be treated with methods such as improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors like smoking, and surgical interventions. Standard non-surgical treatment typically involves removing the subgingival biofilm using subgingival instrumentation."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They compared the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes like probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and adverse effects related to aPDT."
