  "draft": "# Can psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life (an individual's overall sense of well‑being, including physical, emotional, and social aspects) in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.\n**Introduction**\n### What is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. They wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. The authors also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Keywords combined terms for myotonic dystrophy, hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and psychostimulant agents.\n### Study Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible trials and observational studies. Data on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow‑up duration were extracted into a standardized form.\n### Meta‑analysis and Evidence Synthesis\nExtracted results were pooled using a random‑effects model to calculate a summary effect size for the reduction in excessive daytime sleepiness. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of study design and drug class.\n### Confidence in the Evidence\nThe certainty of the evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and potential publication bias. Findings were graded as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross‑over design. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The types of interventions used were psychostimulants, and the comparisons were made against a placebo or no treatment. No information on study funding sources was available. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of psychostimulants in this group of people.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to multiple critical issues and significant deviations from Plain Language Summary guidelines and typical patterns. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement of the Master Style Guide. For example, 'Search Strategy', 'Study Selection and Data Extraction', 'Meta‑analysis and Evidence Synthesis', 'Confidence in the Evidence', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' should be rephrased as questions (e.g., 'How did we search for studies?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', 'How up to date is this review?').\n2.  **Factual Accuracy - Methods Section:**\n    *   **Search Strategy:** The description of the search strategy is too vague compared to the original abstract. The draft states, 'We performed a systematic search of electronic databases...', but the original abstract specifies the exact databases searched (e.g., Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and the search date (5 January 2023). The draft should include these specific details.\n    *   **Study Selection:** The draft states, 'Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible trials and observational studies.' This is factually incorrect. The original abstract clearly states, 'We considered all randomised controlled trials...', meaning observational studies were not included.\n    *   **Meta-analysis:** The draft's description of meta-analysis is generic and lacks specific details from the original abstract, such as how cross-over trials were handled and the use of 'generic inverse variance' for analysis.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This sentence is 49 words long and contains multiple clauses and definitions, making it very difficult to process for a lay audience. The `words_per_sentence` metric is in the P75 range, indicating longer sentences than typical.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Psychostimulants are medicines that increase alertness. They might help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition affecting muscle tone and causing muscle wasting). However, the evidence is not strong enough to be sure, and these medicines may increase the risk of unwanted effects like headaches or nausea.'\n2.  **Simplify Jargon and Technical Terms:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of study design and drug class.' and 'The certainty of the evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and potential publication bias.'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These sentences contain multiple technical terms (e.g., I² statistic, sensitivity analyses, GRADE framework, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias) that are not explained and are unlikely to be understood by a general audience. The high `complex_words`, `complex_words_dc`, and `smog_index` metrics support this.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite (for first quote):** 'We looked at how different the study results were from each other. We also did extra analyses to see if the study design or type of drug affected the results.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite (for second quote):** 'We used a system called GRADE to decide how confident we were in the evidence. This involved looking at factors like how well the studies were designed, if the results were consistent, and if there were enough participants.'\n3.  **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Data on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow‑up duration were extracted into a standardized form.'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** The passive construction 'were extracted' makes it unclear who performed the action. The `passive_voice` metric is in the P90 range, indicating a high number of passive constructions.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Two reviewers independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and dose of psychostimulant, measures of daytime sleepiness, and how long participants were followed.'\n4.  **Reduce Nominalization and Noun-Heavy Sentences:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Extracted results were pooled using a random‑effects model to calculate a summary effect size for the reduction in excessive daytime sleepiness.'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** Phrases like 'reduction in excessive daytime sleepiness' are noun-heavy. Using verbs makes the text more direct and easier to understand. The `nominalization` (P90) and `nouns` (Beyond P90) metrics strongly support this.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We combined the results to estimate how much psychostimulants might reduce excessive daytime sleepiness.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in several key areas. The `smog_index` (16.38), `complex_words_dc` (288.00), `complex_words` (167.00), and `long_words` (247.00) are all 'Beyond P90', indicating a high level of vocabulary complexity. The `passive_voice` (20.00) and `nominalization` (24.00) metrics are in the 'P90' range, and `nouns` (211.00) is 'Beyond P90', confirming the presence of excessive passive constructions and noun-heavy phrasing. These issues contribute to the lower `flesch_reading_ease` (37.17, P25) and higher `words_per_sentence` (22.29, P75), making the text more difficult to read than typical Plain Language Summaries."
