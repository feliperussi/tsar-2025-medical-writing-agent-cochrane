  "draft": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy? \n\nWe looked for studies called randomised controlled trials. These studies compared psychostimulants to a 'dummy' pill (placebo) or no treatment. The studies included adults with myotonic dystrophy whose condition was confirmed by doctors or genetic testing. Two of our researchers read the papers to decide which studies to include. They discussed any differences of opinion to reach an agreement.\n\nWe found six small studies with a total of 136 adults. The results suggested that psychostimulants might reduce sleepiness for some people, but the evidence was not very certain. The studies also showed that people taking these medicines might have more unwanted effects, like headaches or nausea.\n\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. They wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. The authors also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings. The evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\nKey messages: \n- Psychostimulants may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects.\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While the factual information is correct and the text is within the word limit, there are critical issues with structure and clarity that must be addressed. The sections are in a confusing order, and it is missing the required question-based subheadings which makes the summary difficult to follow. Key medical terms are also left undefined.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Reorder the sections and add subheadings.** The summary currently presents methods and results before explaining the medical condition. This is confusing for the reader. You must reorder the paragraphs to follow a logical flow and add question-based subheadings as required by the style guide.\n\n   - **Problem:** The paragraph explaining myotonic dystrophy appears after the results are mentioned. Readers need this context first.\n   - **Suggestion:** Restructure the summary in this order: 1. Background (What is myotonic dystrophy?), 2. Aims (What did we want to find out?), 3. Methods, 4. Results, 5. Limitations, 6. Key Messages. Use the question-based subheadings from the source material, for example: 'What is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?' and 'What did we want to find out?'.\n\n2. **Define key medical terms for the reader.** The summary uses technical terms like 'myotonic dystrophy' and 'psychostimulants' without explaining what they are. This can be a major barrier to understanding for a lay audience.\n\n   - **Problem:** \"Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add the simple, parenthetical definitions that were provided in the source material. For example: \"Can psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting)?\"\n\n3. **Use a more direct, first-person voice.** The style guide requires using 'we' to refer to the review authors, but the draft sometimes switches to a more distant, third-person voice.\n\n   - **Problem:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Change this to the active, first-person voice to be more direct and engaging. For example: \"We aimed to find out what effects psychostimulants have...\"\n\nAddressing these structural and clarity issues will make the summary much easier for patients and the public to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 17 of 18 metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. Sentence length (19.55 words) and passive voice count (10 instances) are well within acceptable limits. However, the Coleman-Liau Index (14.55) is high (P90), indicating that the text may be difficult to read due to long words or complex terminology. This metric supports the recommendation to add definitions for key medical terms to improve reader comprehension."
