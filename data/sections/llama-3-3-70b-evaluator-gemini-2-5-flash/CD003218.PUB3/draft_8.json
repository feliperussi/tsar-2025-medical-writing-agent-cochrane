  "draft": "Can psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting)? \n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem? \nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Doctors are increasingly using psychostimulants to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. We wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. We also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Two reviewers independently checked the studies to find all relevant ‘randomised controlled trials’. These are experiments where people are assigned to treatment groups by chance, which is the most reliable way to compare the effects of a treatment.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. In five of the studies, people took the psychostimulant for a period of time and a dummy pill (placebo) for another period. This ‘cross-over’ design allows for a more direct comparison of the treatment’s effects. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people and the studies themselves were very different from one another. This makes the results harder to combine and understand.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review? \n- Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life (an individual’s overall sense of well-being, including physical, emotional, and social aspects) in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets all critical requirements. However, it is not approved because the language is often too complex and formal for a lay audience, which could prevent patients from easily understanding the key messages. The feedback below focuses on simplifying word choices and sentence structures to improve clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace formal phrases with simpler, everyday language.** The text often uses academic phrasing where simpler words would be clearer for readers.\n   - **Example:** \"This can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"significantly impact\" and \"maintain social and professional relationships\" are formal and less direct.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"This can have a big effect on a person's life, making it hard to do daily activities or keep up with work and friends.\"\n\n2. **Break down long, technical sentences.** Some sentences, particularly in the methods section, are packed with too much information and jargon for a single sentence.\n   - **Example:** \"We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This long sentence combines multiple concepts (systematic search, databases, investigation) that can be difficult for a non-expert to process at once.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break it into two shorter sentences, like: \"We searched online medical databases for studies. We looked for trials that tested psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the definitions provided in parentheses.** While defining terms is good practice, the definitions themselves should be as simple as possible.\n   - **Example:** \"...quality of life (an individual’s overall sense of well-being, including physical, emotional, and social aspects) in people with myotonic dystrophy.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The definition is long and academic. The core concept can be conveyed more concisely.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...quality of life (a person's general well-being) in people with myotonic dystrophy.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** This feedback is supported by the linguistic analysis. While sentence structure is good, the draft has a high number of complex and long words, placing it in the top 10% for vocabulary complexity compared to other summaries (`smog_index`, `complex_words`, `long_words`). Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics into a more typical range and make the summary much easier to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good conformity with PLS patterns for sentence structure, with excellent scores for sentence length (P25) and use of active voice (P75). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics (`smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, `long_words`) are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses substantially more complex and long words than is typical for a PLS, which harms overall readability."
