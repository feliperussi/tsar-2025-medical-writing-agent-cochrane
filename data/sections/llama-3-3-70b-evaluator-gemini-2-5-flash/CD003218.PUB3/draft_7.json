  "draft": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy? \n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem? \nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Doctors are increasingly using psychostimulants to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. We wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. We also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Two reviewers independently checked the studies to identify relevant randomised controlled trials. For each study, we collected key information, such as details about the people involved, the medication and dose they received, and how their sleepiness was measured.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people and the studies themselves were very different from one another (for example, they used different medications or doses). This makes the results harder to combine and understand.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review? \n- Psychostimulants may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it is not approved because it uses key technical terms without explaining them, which could confuse readers. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer for a lay audience.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Explain the term 'cross-over design'.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Five trials had a cross-over design.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a technical research term that most people outside of science will not understand. It's important to either remove this detail if it's not essential, or explain it in simple terms.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In five of the studies, people took the psychostimulant for a period of time and a dummy pill (placebo) for another period. This 'cross-over' design allows for a more direct comparison of the treatment's effects.\"\n\n**2. Explain what a 'randomised controlled trial' is.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Two reviewers independently checked the studies to identify relevant randomised controlled trials.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** While common in research, this term is jargon to the public. Explaining it helps readers understand why these types of studies are important for reliable evidence.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Two reviewers independently checked the studies to find all relevant 'randomised controlled trials'. These are experiments where people are assigned to treatment groups by chance, which is the most reliable way to compare the effects of a treatment.\"\n\n**3. Add helpful definitions for key conditions and treatments.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The title and key messages are a missed opportunity to immediately clarify what these terms mean. The original source material provided helpful parenthetical definitions that were not included in the draft.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** We recommend adopting the definitions from the source material. For example, the title could be: \"Can psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting)?\" These definitions should also be added to the key messages.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns in sentence length and structure, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis also flags a high number of complex words (P90) and a high SMOG index (P90). This supports the editorial feedback, indicating that while the sentences are short, the choice of specific words—particularly unexplained technical terms like 'cross-over design' and 'randomised controlled trials'—is making the text harder to understand than it needs to be."
