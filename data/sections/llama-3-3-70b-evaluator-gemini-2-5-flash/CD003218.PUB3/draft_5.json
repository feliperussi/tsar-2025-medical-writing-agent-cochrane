  "draft": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. We wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. We also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Two reviewers independently checked the studies to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into different treatment groups). Data on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow-up duration were extracted into a standardized form.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people. The people in the studies were also very different from each other, which makes the results harder to combine and understand. The evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life (an individual's overall sense of well-being, including physical, emotional, and social aspects) in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are overly long sentences packed with definitions and some technical phrasing that could be simplified.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the first key message.** The first bullet point is long and hard to follow because it contains three definitions inside one sentence. This makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the main finding.\n   - **Current sentence:** \"Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Break this into a few shorter sentences. For example: \"This review looked at psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) for people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that causes muscle wasting). We found that these medications may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness, but the evidence is not strong. They may also increase the risk of unwanted effects, like headaches or nausea.\"\n\n2. **Make the methods section more direct and active.** The description of how you gathered information is a bit technical and uses passive language.\n   - **Current sentence:** \"Data on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow-up duration were extracted into a standardized form.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Use a more active and straightforward description. For example: \"For each study, we collected key information, such as details about the people involved, the medication and dose they received, and how their sleepiness was measured.\"\n\n3. **Add a separate subheading for the currency statement.** The date of the evidence is currently tacked on to the end of the 'limitations' paragraph. It should have its own standard subheading to make it easy for readers to find.\n   - **Current structure:** The sentence \"The evidence is up to date to January 2023.\" is the last sentence in the \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" section.\n   - **Suggested change:** Create a new subheading after the limitations section, such as \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\", and place the sentence there.\n\nThese changes will help make the summary clearer and easier for patients and their families to understand. The linguistic analysis supports these suggestions, noting that the draft has a high number of complex and long words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 61.1% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis flags higher-than-usual vocabulary complexity. Three metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns: the SMOG index (14.31), complex words (125), and long words (176) are all in the P90 range. This suggests that replacing technical terms and shortening some words would improve overall clarity."
