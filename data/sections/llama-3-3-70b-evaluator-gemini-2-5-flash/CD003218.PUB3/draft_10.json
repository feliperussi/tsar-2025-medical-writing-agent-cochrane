  "draft": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy? \nWe looked at the evidence to find out. \nMyotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects muscles and causes muscle wasting. \nOne common symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness, which can make daily life hard. \nWe wanted to know if psychostimulants, which are medications that increase alertness, can help.\n\n## Background\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. \nOne of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. \nThis can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. \nCurrently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n## Methods\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. \nKeywords combined terms for myotonic dystrophy, hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and psychostimulant agents. \nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible trials and observational studies. \nData on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow-up duration were extracted into a standardized form.\n\n## Results\nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. \nAll studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. \nFive trials had a cross-over design. \nThe studies were conducted in unspecified countries. \nThe types of interventions used were psychostimulants, and the comparisons were made against a placebo or no treatment. \nNo information on study funding sources was available. \nPsychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \nThey may also increase the risk of side effects.\n\n## Key Messages\n- Psychostimulants may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects.\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.\n\n## Evidence Currency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It has two critical issues: a required section is missing, and the subheadings do not follow the style guide. Additionally, several key sentences are too long and complex, which makes them difficult for a lay audience to understand. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Limitations of the evidence' section.** This section is essential for helping readers understand why the evidence is uncertain. It should be placed after the 'Results' section.\n   - **Suggested text (from source material):** \"The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings.\"\n\n2. **Rewrite all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader.\n   - **Instead of:** \"Background\"\n   - **Use:** \"What is myotonic dystrophy and why did we do this review?\"\n   - **Instead of:** \"Methods\"\n   - **Use:** \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n   - **Instead of:** \"Results\"\n   - **Use:** \"What did we find?\"\n\n3. **Break up long sentences in the 'Key Messages' section.** Two of the three key messages are over 35 words long, combining multiple ideas into a single sentence. This makes them hard to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Psychostimulants may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Psychostimulants may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy. Future studies should also try to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows that sentence length metrics (words_per_sentence, lix, rix) are higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, indicating the text is harder to read than it needs to be.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is statistically similar to many Plain Language Summaries, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly on metrics related to sentence length and complexity. The 'lix' and 'rix' scores are in the P90 range, and the average 'words_per_sentence' is in the P75 range. This confirms the editorial finding that several sentences are too long, which negatively impacts readability for a lay audience."
