  "draft": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychostimulants are medicines that increase alertness. They might help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure, and these medicines may increase the risk of unwanted effects like headaches or nausea.\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. They wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. The authors also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched several electronic databases, including the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP, on 5 January 2023. We also checked the bibliographies of identified papers and made enquiries of the authors of the papers.\n\nWhat studies did we include?\nWe considered all randomised controlled trials that have evaluated any type of psychostimulant in children or adults with myotonic dystrophy, confirmed by clinical and electromyographic diagnostic, or genetic testing, and hypersomnia.\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nTwo review authors independently scrutinised potentially relevant papers for study inclusion, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently performed data extraction. We obtained unpublished data from some study authors. We assessed the methodological quality of trials and applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. We judged five trials as being at low risk of bias. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of psychostimulants in this group of people.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it is not yet ready for publication. The primary issue is that several sections, particularly those describing the methods, are copied directly from the technical abstract and are not written in plain language. This makes them difficult for a general audience to understand. The vocabulary throughout the summary is also too complex. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the methods sections in plain language.** The sections 'How did we search for studies?', 'What studies did we include?', and 'How did we analyze the data?' are filled with technical jargon that is not suitable for a Plain Language Summary. The goal is to build trust by explaining the process simply, not to list technical criteria.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We considered all randomised controlled trials that have evaluated any type of psychostimulant in children or adults with myotonic dystrophy, confirmed by clinical and electromyographic diagnostic, or genetic testing, and hypersomnia.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We looked for studies called randomised controlled trials. These studies compared psychostimulants to a 'dummy' pill (placebo) or no treatment. The studies included adults with myotonic dystrophy whose condition was confirmed by doctors or genetic testing.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex words with simpler, everyday alternatives.** The summary uses many long and technical words that make it hard to read, even though the sentences are short.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Two review authors independently scrutinised potentially relevant papers for study inclusion, with any disagreements resolved by discussion.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Two of our researchers read the papers to decide which studies to include. They discussed any differences of opinion to reach an agreement.\"\n\n3. **Make the 'What did we find?' section more specific.** This section repeats the key messages without adding much new information. Avoid technical details like 'cross-over design' and instead, briefly explain the main findings in simple terms.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We found six studies that involved 136 people... Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found six small studies with a total of 136 adults. The results suggested that psychostimulants might reduce sleepiness for some people, but the evidence was not very certain. The studies also showed that people taking these medicines might have more unwanted effects, like headaches or nausea.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your own evaluation results confirm these issues. The SMOG index (a measure of complexity) is extremely high ('Beyond P90'), and the counts for complex and long words are also in the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more difficult than in a typical Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While sentence length and structure are excellent (most readability scores are in the best 25th percentile), the vocabulary is far too complex for a lay audience. The SMOG index, which is sensitive to multi-syllable words, is beyond the 90th percentile. Similarly, the counts for complex words (Dale-Chall and 3+ syllables) and long words (7+ characters) are all in the 90th percentile. This suggests the draft uses short sentences but fills them with technical jargon, which was the main reason for the 'NOT_APPROVED' grade."
