  "draft": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem? \nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. We wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. We also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Two reviewers independently checked the studies to identify relevant randomised controlled trials. For each study, we collected key information, such as details about the people involved, the medication and dose they received, and how their sleepiness was measured.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people. The people in the studies were also very different from each other, which makes the results harder to combine and understand.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review? \n- Psychostimulants, medications that increase alertness, may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, a condition that causes muscle wasting.\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.",

      "feedback": "This draft is very well-written and clear, but it cannot be approved because of a critical factual omission in the first key message. The message highlights a potential benefit without mentioning the significant uncertainty and risk of side effects found in the review, creating an unbalanced and potentially misleading summary for patients.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Balance the First Key Message:** The first key message is incomplete and overly positive. It must be revised to accurately reflect the review's findings on uncertainty and potential harm.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"- Psychostimulants, medications that increase alertness, may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This omits the crucial caveats that the evidence is not strong and that the drugs may cause side effects. This misrepresents the balance of the review's conclusions.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- Psychostimulants may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\"\n\n2. **Make the Limitations More Specific:** The explanation of the evidence's limitations is too vague.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"The people in the studies were also very different from each other, which makes the results harder to combine and understand.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** Readers don't know *how* the people or studies were different. Adding specific details makes the limitation easier to grasp.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people and the studies themselves were very different from one another (for example, they used different medications or doses). This makes the results harder to combine and understand.\"\n\n3. **Use Active Voice in the Introduction:** A sentence in the background section uses passive voice, which can be less direct for readers.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The active voice (\"Doctors are using...\") is more direct and easier to read, as recommended by the style guide.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Doctors are increasingly using psychostimulants to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Sentence length (17.7 words) and use of active voice are excellent. The only notable deviation is the SMOG index (grade level 13.8), which is slightly high. This is likely due to necessary medical terms like 'psychostimulants' and 'myotonic dystrophy', and is not a major concern as the overall readability remains strong."
