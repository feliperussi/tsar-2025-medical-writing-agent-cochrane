  "draft": "Can psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting)?\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. We wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. We also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible trials and observational studies. Data on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow-up duration were extracted into a standardized form.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects, such as headaches or nausea.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings. The evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).\n- The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life (an individual's overall sense of well-being, including physical, emotional, and social aspects) in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it fails on two critical checks: a subheading is not phrased as a question, and there is a factual inaccuracy in the methods section. Additionally, several sections use technical language that will be difficult for a lay audience to understand, which is reflected in the high complexity scores from the evaluation. The following 3 improvements are needed before this summary can be approved.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Rephrase all subheadings as questions.**\nThe style guide requires all subheadings to be questions. The final subheading does not follow this rule.\n- **Problematic Text:** `Key messages:`\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is a label, not a question. It breaks the conversational, question-and-answer flow of the summary.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `What are the key messages of this review?`\n\n**2. Correct the description of included studies.**\nThe methods section incorrectly states that the review included observational studies, but the source abstract confirms only randomised controlled trials were eligible.\n- **Problematic Text:** `Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible trials and observational studies.`\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is factually incorrect and misrepresents the type of evidence included in the review, potentially misleading the reader about the strength of the study designs.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `Two reviewers independently checked the studies to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into different treatment groups).`\n\n**3. Simplify technical language, especially in the limitations section.**\nThe summary uses jargon that is not explained, making it difficult for readers to understand the weaknesses of the evidence.\n- **Problematic Text:** `The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings.`\n- **Why it's a problem:** The term \"heterogeneous populations\" is technical jargon. The entire sentence is long and dense, making it hard to follow.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `Our confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people. The people in the studies were also very different from each other, which makes the results harder to combine and understand.`\n\nBy addressing these points, the summary will be more accurate, easier to read, and better aligned with Cochrane's plain language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that while the summary has good structural elements like active voice and pronoun use, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics, including `smog_index` (14.5), `complex_words` (129), and `long_words` (181), are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical jargon and replace difficult words with more common alternatives to improve readability for a lay audience."
