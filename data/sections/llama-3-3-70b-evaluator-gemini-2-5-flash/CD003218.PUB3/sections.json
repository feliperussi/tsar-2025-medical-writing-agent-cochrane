  "key_messages": [
    "Psychostimulants (medications that increase alertness) may be helpful in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful or unpleasant effects, such as headaches or nausea).",
    "The current evidence does not tell us about the long-term effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness or quality of life (an individual's overall sense of well‑being, including physical, emotional, and social aspects) in people with myotonic dystrophy.",
    "More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly in the long term, and to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest for this group of people."

      "subheading": "What is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and other systems in the body. One of the common symptoms of myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social and professional relationships. Currently, psychostimulants are being used to treat hypersomnia in people with myotonic dystrophy."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. They wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes in these individuals. The authors also sought to evaluate the safety of psychostimulants and the potential risk of adverse events in this population."

    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies investigating the use of psychostimulants in patients with myotonic dystrophy who experience hypersomnia. Keywords combined terms for myotonic dystrophy, hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and psychostimulant agents."

      "subheading": "Study Selection and Data Extraction",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible trials and observational studies. Data on participant characteristics, type and dose of psychostimulant, outcome measures of daytime sleepiness, and follow‑up duration were extracted into a standardized form."

    {
      "subheading": "Meta‑analysis and Evidence Synthesis",
      "content": "Extracted results were pooled using a random‑effects model to calculate a summary effect size for the reduction in excessive daytime sleepiness. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of study design and drug class."

      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "The certainty of the evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and potential publication bias. Findings were graded as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross‑over design. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The types of interventions used were psychostimulants, and the comparisons were made against a placebo or no treatment. No information on study funding sources was available. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also increase the risk of side effects. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of psychostimulants in this group of people."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods, which reduces confidence in the findings.",
