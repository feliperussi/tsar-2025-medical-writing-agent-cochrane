  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference in whether people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Overall, the evidence is uncertain, and we did not find a clear sign that masks reduce these infections.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza.\n- Future studies should test how well masks and hand washing work for different groups of people in various places. Researchers also need to study how well people follow these measures, especially those most likely to get very sick.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well physical measures work to stop or slow the spread of viruses that affect breathing. We looked at different types of physical interventions, including masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing. We also wanted to know which interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies in total. In this update, we added 11 new studies which included 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The included studies were very different from each other, with participants of different ages and settings. The risk of bias for the studies was mostly high or unclear. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because: the studies were very different from each other; some had very few people; and in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting (which can bias results). Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the effects of physical measures in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. We will continue to update our review as new evidence becomes available.",

It contains a critical factual error and several areas where clarity can be improved for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n*   **Factual Error:** The number of participants is misrepresented.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'We found 78 studies in total. In this is update, we added 11 new studies which included 610,872 people.'\n    *   **The problem:** This incorrectly states the total number of people across all studies. The source abstract clarifies this number is from the 11 new studies only.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found 78 studies in total. This update adds 11 new studies, which included 610,872 people.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex Vocabulary:** The text uses many technical and long words that make it difficult to read. This is supported by the high scores for complex and long words in the evaluation report.\n    *   **Example:** 'Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Words like 'respiratory', 'significant', 'epidemics', and 'pandemics' can be unfamiliar to many readers.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Viruses that affect breathing, like the flu and coronavirus, are a major threat to people's health around the world. These viruses can spread quickly and cause many people to get sick.'\n\n2.  **Clarify the Key Message on Masks:** The first key message is slightly repetitive and could be more direct.\n    *   **Example:** 'Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference in whether people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Overall, the evidence is uncertain, and we did not find a clear sign that masks reduce these infections.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence largely repeats the first, which can dilute the main point.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. We are uncertain about the effects of masks because the evidence is not clear.'\n\n3.  **Fix the Factual Error in the Results Section:** As noted in the critical issue, the reporting of participant numbers must be corrected to maintain accuracy.\n    *   **Example:** 'In this update, we added 11 new studies which included 610,872 people.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** It misrepresents the total evidence base of the review.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'This update adds 11 new studies, which included 610,872 people.'\n\nPlease address these points to ensure the summary is accurate and easy for a general audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows that the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, particularly in sentence structure. Metrics like words per sentence (16.39, P25) and active voice count (72, P75) are in the best quartile, indicating sentences are short and direct. However, the summary deviates significantly from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics are in the P90 range, indicating the text is harder to read than is typical for a PLS: SMOG Index (14.1), Dale-Chall complex words (224), complex words (118), and long words (182). This suggests a need to replace technical terms and long words with simpler, more common alternatives to improve readability for a lay audience."
