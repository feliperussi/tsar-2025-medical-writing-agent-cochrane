  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (influenza-like illness refers to symptoms similar to the flu) or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks, and there is uncertainty about the effects of face masks.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as masks and hand hygiene, in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of acute respiratory infections.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well physical measures work to stop or slow the spread of viruses that affect breathing. We looked at different types of physical interventions, including masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing. We also wanted to know which interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The included studies were heterogeneous, with participants of different ages and settings. The risk of bias for the studies was mostly high or unclear. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the effects of physical measures in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. We will continue to update our review as new evidence becomes available.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It contains a critical factual error and several areas where clarity can be significantly improved for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n\n1.  **Factual Error:** The summary incorrectly states the total number of participants.\n    *   **Your text:** 'We found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is inaccurate. The original abstract states that the 610,872 participants are from the 11 *new* studies added in this update, not the total from all 78 studies. This misrepresents the evidence base.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found 78 studies in total. In this update, we added 11 new studies which included 610,872 people.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex Language and Jargon:** The text uses some technical terms and dense phrasing that will be difficult for readers. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of complex and long words (SMOG index, complex_words, and long_words metrics are all in the 90th percentile).\n    *   **Example 1:** 'The included studies were heterogeneous...'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Heterogeneous' is jargon that a lay reader may not understand.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies we found were very different from each other.'\n    *   **Example 2:** 'Future research should focus on addressing the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as masks and hand hygiene, in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of acute respiratory infections.'\n    *   **Problem:** This 39-word sentence is noun-heavy ('effectiveness', 'interventions', 'impact', 'adherence') and hard to follow.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Future studies should test how well masks and hand washing work for different groups of people in various places. Researchers also need to study how well people follow these measures, especially those most likely to get very sick.'\n\n2.  **Improve Clarity in Key Messages:** The first key message is slightly repetitive and could be more direct.\n    *   **Your text:** 'Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (influenza-like illness refers to symptoms similar to the flu) or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks, and there is uncertainty about the effects of face masks.'\n    *   **Problem:** The final clause 'and there is uncertainty about the effects of face masks' repeats the idea of 'little or no difference'.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference in whether people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Overall, the evidence is uncertain, and we did not find a clear sign that masks reduce these infections.'\n\n3.  **Explain Technical Terms in the 'Limitations' Section:** The limitations are listed as a dense string of technical terms without explanation.\n    *   **Your text:** 'The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is a list of technical research terms. The source text includes a helpful parenthetical for 'blinding', which was omitted here and would benefit the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the results is limited because: the studies were very different from each other; some had very few people; and in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting (which can bias results). Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with sentence length (words_per_sentence) and active voice use falling in the best quartile. However, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, SMOG index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words—are in the 90th percentile range, indicating the text is denser and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests a need to simplify word choices and reduce noun-heavy phrasing to improve readability for a lay audience."
