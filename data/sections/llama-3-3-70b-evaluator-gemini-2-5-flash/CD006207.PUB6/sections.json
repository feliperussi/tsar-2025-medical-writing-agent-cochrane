  "key_messages": [
    "Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (influenza-like illness refers to symptoms similar to the flu) or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks, and there is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, with no clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with their use.",
    "Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza, and there were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators (N95/P2 respirators are a type of mask that filters out very small particles) in healthcare workers.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as masks and hand hygiene, in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of acute respiratory infections (acute respiratory infections refer to infections that affect the lungs and airways), to provide more definitive answers to these important questions."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of respiratory viruses?",
      "content": "Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses."

      "subheading": "What are physical interventions and how can they help?",
      "content": "Physical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. They wanted to determine which physical interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success. The authors also sought to identify any potential harms associated with these interventions."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway, with some studies taking place in suburban schools, hospital wards, and crowded inner city settings. The included studies were heterogeneous, with participants of different ages and settings, and the risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster-RCTs was mostly high or unclear. The studies compared different physical interventions, such as medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, and hand hygiene, to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We found no RCTs on gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports."

Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the objective outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection."
