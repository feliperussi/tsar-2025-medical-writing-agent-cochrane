These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. They wanted to determine which physical interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success. The authors also sought to identify any potential harms associated with these interventions.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway, with some studies taking place in suburban schools, hospital wards, and crowded inner city settings. The included studies were heterogeneous, with participants of different ages and settings, and the risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster-RCTs was mostly high or unclear. The studies compared different physical interventions, such as medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, and hand hygiene, to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We found no RCTs on gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports.\nMain results: Effects of physical interventions on respiratory virus transmission\nWearing masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the objective outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

Additionally, the 'Key Messages' section contains excessively long and complex sentences that hinder immediate understanding for a patient audience. The overall text also exhibits a high degree of vocabulary complexity and noun-heavy phrasing, as confirmed by the linguistic analysis. Significant revisions are needed to improve clarity and adherence to plain language principles.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate good overall conformity with PLS patterns for about 72% of features (9 features in the best quartile, 4 in the median range). However, 5 features (27.8%) deviate significantly from typical PLS patterns, falling 'Beyond P90'. Specifically, the text shows high complexity in its vocabulary and structure: the SMOG index (16.0), Dale-Chall complex words (301.0), general complex words (160.0), and long words (250.0) are all 'Beyond P90', suggesting the text is harder to read and uses more difficult vocabulary than typical PLS. The noun count (208.0) is also 'Beyond P90', indicating a noun-heavy writing style. These deviations highlight the need to simplify language, shorten sentences, and use more active verbs."
