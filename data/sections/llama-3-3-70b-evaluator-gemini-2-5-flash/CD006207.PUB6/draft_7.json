  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Our confidence in the results for masks is limited because of flaws in how the studies were conducted and because many people in the studies did not wear them consistently.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza.\n- Future studies should test how well masks and hand washing work for different groups of people in various places. Researchers also need to study how well people follow these measures, especially those most likely to get very sick.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza (the flu) and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well physical measures work to stop or slow the spread of viruses that affect breathing. We looked at different types of physical interventions, including masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing. We also wanted to know which interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies in total. This update adds 11 new studies, which included 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The included studies were very different from each other, with participants of different ages and settings. Many of the studies had flaws in their methods, which reduces our confidence in their results. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because the studies were very different from each other, some had very few people, and in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in. Most importantly, in many studies, people did not follow the instructions consistently, such as not wearing masks or washing hands as often as asked. This makes it difficult to know the true effect of these measures.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the effects of physical measures in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. We will continue to update our review as new evidence becomes available.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs revision to simplify clinical language and clarify key concepts for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of vague or technical phrases that reduce readability. Focusing on the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer for patients and the public.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace clinical jargon with simpler, everyday language.**\nSome phrases are too technical for a plain language summary. This makes the findings harder to understand.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"modestly reduce the burden\" is clinical jargon. A reader might not understand what \"burden\" means in this context.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Washing your hands may slightly reduce your chances of getting a respiratory illness.\"\n\n**2. Make the key messages more direct and specific.**\nThe first key message explains why your confidence is limited, but the reason is too vague.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Our confidence in the results for masks is limited because of flaws in how the studies were conducted and because many people in the studies did not wear them consistently.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"flaws in how the studies were conducted\" doesn't give the reader a clear reason for the uncertainty.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in this finding is limited. Some studies had design issues, and in many, people did not wear masks as instructed. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about how well masks work.\"\n\n**3. Clarify *why* study limitations matter.**\nThe limitations section mentions that people knew which treatment they were getting, but it doesn't explain why this is a problem.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"...in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is an attempt to explain the concept of 'blinding', but it doesn't tell the reader why this knowledge is a limitation.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...in many studies, people knew whether they were in the group asked to wear masks or not. Knowing this might have changed their other behaviors (like social distancing), which could affect the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that while the draft has good sentence length and structure, its vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Five metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating a high number of nouns (161), complex words (124), and long words (196). This aligns with the editorial feedback, suggesting that replacing clinical terms and jargon with simpler alternatives is the highest priority for improvement."
