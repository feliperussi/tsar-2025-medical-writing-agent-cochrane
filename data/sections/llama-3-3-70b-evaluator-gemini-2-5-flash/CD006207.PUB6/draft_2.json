  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as masks and hand hygiene, in multiple settings and populations.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. They wanted to determine which physical interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success. The authors also sought to identify any potential harms associated with these interventions.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway, with some studies taking place in suburban schools, hospital wards, and crowded inner city settings. The included studies were heterogeneous, with participants of different ages and settings, and the risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster-RCTs was mostly high or unclear. The studies compared different physical interventions, such as medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, and hand hygiene, to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We found no RCTs on gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nWearing masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the objective outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

Specifically, the number of participants is incorrect, the key messages omit crucial nuance about uncertainty and limitations, and the text uses unexplained technical jargon. These issues must be addressed to ensure the summary is accurate and clear for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in sentence structure, with appropriate sentence length (P25) and use of active voice (P75). However, the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, SMOG index, complex words (both types), and long words—are in the P90 range, indicating the text is much denser and uses more difficult vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical terms and reduce jargon."
