  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (influenza-like illness refers to symptoms similar to the flu) or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks, and there is uncertainty about the effects of face masks.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as masks and hand hygiene, in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of acute respiratory infections (acute respiratory infections refer to infections that affect the lungs and airways).\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. They wanted to determine which physical interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success. The authors also sought to identify any potential harms associated with these interventions.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway, with some studies taking place in suburban schools, hospital wards, and crowded inner city settings. The included studies were heterogeneous, with participants of different ages and settings, and the risk of bias for the RCTs (randomized controlled trials, which are studies where participants are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group) and cluster-RCTs (cluster randomized controlled trials, which are studies where groups of participants are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group) was mostly high or unclear. The studies compared different physical interventions, such as medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators (N95/P2 respirators are a type of mask that filters out very small particles), and hand hygiene, to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We found no RCTs on gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nWearing masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the objective outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is a critical factual error: the key messages are incomplete and missing important findings from the source material. Additionally, the summary's clarity is significantly reduced by extremely long sentences, complex vocabulary, and the use of long, disruptive parenthetical definitions. These issues make the text difficult for a lay audience to understand. The feedback below outlines the most important changes needed to improve accuracy and readability.\n\n### Critical Issue: Incomplete Key Messages\n\nThe second key message in the draft is missing a key finding mentioned in the source material.\n\n- **Original Draft:** \"Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza.\"\n- **Missing Information (from Source of Truth):** \"...and there were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators... in healthcare workers.\"\n- **Action:** Please revise the key message to include this important finding about N95 respirators.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Remove long definitions from sentences.**\n\nYour sentences defining technical terms are too long and break the flow of reading. This makes important information very hard to understand.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The included studies were heterogeneous, with participants of different ages and settings, and the risk of bias for the RCTs (randomized controlled trials, which are studies where participants are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group) and cluster-RCTs (cluster randomized controlled trials, which are studies where groups of participants are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group) was mostly high or unclear.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence is 76 words long. The definitions are so long that the reader forgets the main point. These definitions should be simplified and separated from the results.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The 78 studies we found were very different from each other. They included people of all ages in settings from schools to hospitals. The risk of bias in the studies was mostly high or unclear. (Bias is anything that might lead to a wrong result).\"\n\n**2. Shorten sentences and use simpler words.**\n\nThe summary uses many long, complex words and sentences that make it difficult to read. This is reflected in the high scores for `complex_words` and `smog_index`.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as masks and hand hygiene, in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of acute respiratory infections (acute respiratory infections refer to infections that affect the lungs and airways).\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 51-word sentence is filled with complex terms like 'addressing the effectiveness', 'interventions', 'populations', 'adherence', and 'acute respiratory infections'. The definition at the end makes it even longer.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Future studies should test how well measures like masks and hand washing work for different groups of people. It is also important to study whether people stick to these measures, especially those who are most likely to get sick from lung and airway infections.\"\n\n**3. Use more direct, active language.**\n\nMany sentences are written in a passive or noun-heavy style, which can feel indirect and academic. Using more verbs makes the text more engaging and easier to follow.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"assess the effectiveness\" is a nominalization (a noun-based phrase). Using a direct verb is clearer.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well physical measures work to stop or slow the spread of viruses that affect breathing.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mixed profile. While the draft conforms well on some plain language elements like pronoun use and active voice count (both in the best quartile), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in critical areas related to complexity and vocabulary. Five metrics are 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. These include `nouns` (214.0), `smog_index` (16.0), `complex_words_dc` (308.0), `complex_words` (162.0), and `long_words` (247.0). The high `passive_voice` count (20.0) also contributes to lower readability. These metrics support the editorial feedback, highlighting the need to simplify vocabulary, shorten sentences, and reduce passive constructions to improve clarity for the intended audience."
