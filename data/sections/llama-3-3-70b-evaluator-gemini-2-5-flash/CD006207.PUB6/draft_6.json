  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. We are uncertain about the effects of masks because the evidence is not clear.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza.\n- Future studies should test how well masks and hand washing work for different groups of people in various places. Researchers also need to study how well people follow these measures, especially those most likely to get very sick.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nViruses that affect breathing, like the flu and coronavirus, are a major threat to people's health around the world. These viruses can spread quickly and cause many people to get sick. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well physical measures work to stop or slow the spread of viruses that affect breathing. We looked at different types of physical interventions, including masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing. We also wanted to know which interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies in total. This update adds 11 new studies, which included 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The included studies were very different from each other, with participants of different ages and settings. The risk of bias for the studies was mostly high or unclear. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because the studies were very different from each other, some had very few people, and in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the effects of physical measures in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. We will continue to update our review as new evidence becomes available.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores, but it needs a few key revisions to ensure patients can fully understand the context and limitations of the evidence. The main issues are the use of unexplained technical terms and the omission of a critical limitation (low adherence) mentioned in the source abstract. Addressing these will significantly improve clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain the term 'risk of bias' in plain language.** Readers won't understand what this means or why it matters.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The risk of bias for the studies was mostly high or unclear.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Many of the studies had flaws in their methods (what researchers call 'risk of bias'), which reduces our confidence in their results.\"\n\n2. **Add the crucial limitation about low adherence.** The original abstract highlights that low adherence was a major issue, but this is missing from the draft's limitations section. This context is essential for understanding why the results are what they are.\n   - **Problematic section:** The section \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" does not mention adherence.\n   - **Suggested addition:** \"Most importantly, in many studies, people did not follow the instructions consistently (for example, they did not wear masks or wash hands as often as asked). This makes it difficult to know the true effect of these measures.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the wording in the key messages.** The second key message is slightly vague and could be more direct.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We are uncertain about the effects of masks because the evidence is not clear.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the results for masks is limited because of flaws in how the studies were conducted and because many people in the studies did not wear them consistently.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and structure are excellent. However, the analysis identified some vocabulary complexity issues, with the 'smog_index' (13.7), 'complex_words_dc' (214), and 'long_words' (174) metrics falling in the P90 range. This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice could be simpler, which supports the editorial recommendation to replace technical terms like 'risk of bias' with plain language explanations."
