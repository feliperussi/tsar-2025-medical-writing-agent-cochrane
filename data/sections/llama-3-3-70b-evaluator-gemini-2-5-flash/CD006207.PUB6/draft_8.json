  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Our confidence in this finding is limited. Some studies had design issues, and in many, people did not wear masks as instructed. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about how well masks work.\n- Washing your hands may slightly reduce your chances of getting a respiratory illness. \n- Future studies should test how well masks and hand washing work for different groups of people in various places. Researchers also need to study how well people follow these measures, especially those most likely to get very sick.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza (the flu) and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of recent outbreaks include the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, SARS in 2003, and COVID-19 in 2019. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and how can they help?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs, to help prevent the spread of illness. However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well physical measures work to stop or slow the spread of viruses that affect breathing. We looked at different types of physical interventions, including masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing. We also wanted to know which interventions are most effective, how they can be implemented, and what factors influence their success.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies in total. This update adds 11 new studies, which included 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The included studies were very different from each other, with participants of different ages and settings. Many of the studies had flaws in their methods, which reduces our confidence in their results. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Washing your hands may slightly reduce your chances of getting a respiratory illness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because the studies were very different from each other, some had very few people, and in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in. Most importantly, in many studies, people did not follow the instructions consistently, such as not wearing masks or washing hands as often as asked. This makes it difficult to know the true effect of these measures. In many studies, people knew whether they were in the group asked to wear masks or not. Knowing this might have changed their other behaviors (like social distancing), which could affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the effects of physical measures in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. We will continue to update our review as new evidence becomes available.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It has a clear structure and covers all the required sections. The use of questions for headings is excellent. However, it cannot be approved until a critical factual error is corrected and a few clarity issues are addressed to make it easier for a lay audience to understand.\n\n**Critical Issue (Must Fix)**\n\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy in Results:** The summary misrepresents the number of participants in the included studies.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We found 78 studies in total. This update adds 11 new studies, which included 610,872 people.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This implies the 610,872 participants are from all 78 studies. The source abstract clarifies this number is from the 11 *new* studies only. This is a significant misrepresentation of the evidence base.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found 78 studies in total. In this update, we added 11 new studies that included 610,872 people.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed for Clarity**\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex and Noun-Heavy Language:** Some paragraphs use technical-sounding words and phrasing that can be simplified for a general audience.\n    *   **Problematic Sentences:** \"Physical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and physical distancing, are measures that can be taken to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in combination with other measures... However, it is essential to understand the effectiveness of these interventions to ensure they are used effectively.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This section is dense with words like 'interventions', 'combination', and 'effectiveness'. It's noun-heavy and less direct than it could be.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Physical measures like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping a distance from others can help slow the spread of viruses. They can be used along with vaccines and antiviral drugs. It is important to know how well these measures work so we can use them in the best way.\"\n\n2.  **Make Key Messages More Direct:** The first key message is too long because it mixes the main finding with the limitations. Key messages should be brief and high-level.\n    *   **Problematic Bullet Point:** \"- Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Our confidence in this finding is limited. Some studies had design issues, and in many, people did not wear masks as instructed. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about how well masks work.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is four sentences long. The details about study limitations are important but belong in the 'Limitations of the evidence' section, not in the key messages at the very top.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"- Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. Our confidence in this finding is limited because of issues with how the studies were conducted.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify the Limitations:** The explanation of limitations uses jargon and could be clearer about why these issues matter.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Our confidence in the results is limited because the studies were very different from each other, some had very few people, and in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"knew which treatment they were getting\" is jargon for 'lack of blinding'. It doesn't explain to the reader *why* this is a problem.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the results is limited for several reasons. The studies were all very different, and some included only a few people. Most importantly, in many studies, people did not follow the instructions consistently (for example, not wearing masks as often as asked). Also, people knew whether they were in the group asked to wear masks or not. Knowing this might have changed their other behaviors, which could affect the results.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis**\nYour edits to simplify vocabulary will help address the issues flagged in the linguistic analysis. The report noted that while sentence structure is good, the draft has a higher-than-typical number of nouns, complex words, and long words (all in the P90 range), which makes the text more difficult to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has excellent structural readability, with short sentences and high use of active voice, placing it in the best quartile for 12 of 18 metrics. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—including the SMOG index, complex words, and long words—are in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests a need to simplify word choices."
