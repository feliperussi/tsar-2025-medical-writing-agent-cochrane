  "key_messages": [
    "Birth control pills containing drospirenone (a type of hormone) may help improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (a condition that causes physical and emotional symptoms before a woman's period), including functional impairments, but may also lead to more unwanted effects, such as breast pain and nausea, compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment).",
    "The evidence for the effectiveness of these pills is not very strong, and we do not know if they work for women with less severe symptoms or if they are better than other types of birth control pills, highlighting the need for more research in this area.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these pills, compare them to other treatments, and focus on outcomes that are important to women with premenstrual syndrome, such as quality of life and symptom relief, to provide more reliable and useful information for decision-making."

      "content": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem that affects many women. It is characterized by physical and emotional symptoms that occur in the premenstrual phase of a woman's cycle and can interfere with daily life. A more severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which can have a significant impact on a woman's quality of life. While some women may find relief from symptoms with lifestyle changes or other treatments, others may require more targeted interventions. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), which contain both progestin and oestrogen, have been explored as a potential treatment option for PMS."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COCs containing drospirenone in women with PMS. They wanted to determine whether these contraceptives can improve premenstrual symptoms, and what the potential risks and side effects might be. By examining the evidence from randomized controlled trials, the authors sought to provide a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of using COCs containing drospirenone for PMS treatment."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found five studies that involved 858 women with premenstrual syndrome, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The studies were randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone with placebo or with another combined oral contraceptive. The total duration of the studies is not specified in the abstract. The population characteristics include women with premenstrual syndrome, with most studies focusing on those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The study settings are not explicitly stated in terms of countries, but the search for studies included several international databases. The interventions used were combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol, and the comparisons were made against placebo or other combined oral contraceptives. The combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may improve overall premenstrual symptoms and functional impairment due to premenstrual symptoms, but it may also lead to more adverse effects compared to a placebo. For every 100 women taking this contraceptive, 10 to 16 may stop taking it due to adverse effects, compared to 3 who would stop taking a placebo. The contraceptive may also lead to more breast pain, nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and menstrual disorder, but its effect on nervousness, headache, asthenia, and pain is uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies varied in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, leading to heterogeneity.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2022."
