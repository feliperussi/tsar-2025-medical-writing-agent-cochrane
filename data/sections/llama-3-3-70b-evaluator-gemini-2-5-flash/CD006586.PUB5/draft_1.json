  "draft": "# Can birth control pills containing drospirenone (a type of hormone) help improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (a condition that causes physical and emotional symptoms before a woman's period)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Birth control pills containing drospirenone (a type of hormone) may help improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (a condition that causes physical and emotional symptoms before a woman's period), including functional impairments, but may also lead to more unwanted effects, such as breast pain and nausea, compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of these pills is not very strong, and we do not know if they work for women with less severe symptoms or if they are better than other types of birth control pills, highlighting the need for more research in this area.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these pills, compare them to other treatments, and focus on outcomes that are important to women with premenstrual syndrome, such as quality of life and symptom relief, to provide more reliable and useful information for decision-making.\n**Introduction**\n### What is premenstrual syndrome and why is it a problem?\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem that affects many women. It is characterized by physical and emotional symptoms that occur in the premenstrual phase of a woman's cycle and can interfere with daily life. A more severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which can have a significant impact on a woman's quality of life. While some women may find relief from symptoms with lifestyle changes or other treatments, others may require more targeted interventions. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), which contain both progestin and oestrogen, have been explored as a potential treatment option for PMS.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COCs containing drospirenone in women with PMS. They wanted to determine whether these contraceptives can improve premenstrual symptoms, and what the potential risks and side effects might be. By examining the evidence from randomized controlled trials, the authors sought to provide a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of using COCs containing drospirenone for PMS treatment.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found five studies that involved 858 women with premenstrual syndrome, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The studies were randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone with placebo or with another combined oral contraceptive. The total duration of the studies is not specified in the abstract. The population characteristics include women with premenstrual syndrome, with most studies focusing on those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The study settings are not explicitly stated in terms of countries, but the search for studies included several international databases. The interventions used were combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol, and the comparisons were made against placebo or other combined oral contraceptives. The combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may improve overall premenstrual symptoms and functional impairment due to premenstrual symptoms, but it may also lead to more adverse effects compared to a placebo. For every 100 women taking this contraceptive, 10 to 16 may stop taking it due to adverse effects, compared to 3 who would stop taking a placebo. The contraceptive may also lead to more breast pain, nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and menstrual disorder, but its effect on nervousness, headache, asthenia, and pain is uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies varied in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, leading to heterogeneity.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues in factual accuracy and adherence to style guidelines, as well as significant clarity and readability problems. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy:** The statement in the 'Results' section regarding withdrawal rates is incorrect. The original abstract states a risk of 6% to 16% for drospirenone plus EE, meaning '6 to 16 women' out of 100, not '10 to 16'.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"For every 100 women taking this contraceptive, 10 to 16 may stop taking it due to adverse effects, compared to 3 who would stop taking a placebo.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For every 100 women taking this contraceptive, 6 to 16 may stop taking it due to unwanted effects, compared to 3 who would stop taking a placebo.\"\n2.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide.\n    *   **Problematic Quotes:** \"### Methods\", \"### Limitations\", \"### Currency\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrites:** \"### How did we do the review?\", \"### What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"### How up to date is this review?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Reduce Passive Voice and Shorten Long Sentences:** The text frequently uses passive constructions and has many long, complex sentences, making it difficult to follow. This is supported by the metrics showing 'passive_voice' is 'BEYOND_P90' and 'words_per_sentence' is 'P90'.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"It is characterized by physical and emotional symptoms that occur in the premenstrual phase of a woman's cycle and can interfere with daily life.\" (Introduction)\n    *   **Why problematic:** Uses passive voice and is a long sentence (25 words) that could be more direct.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Women with PMS experience physical and emotional symptoms before their period that can interfere with daily life.\"\n2.  **Simplify Complex Vocabulary and Jargon:** Several technical terms are used without explanation, which would confuse a patient audience. This is strongly supported by multiple readability indices and vocabulary complexity metrics (e.g., 'smog_index', 'complex_words', 'long_words', 'flesch_kincaid_grade') being in the P90/BEYOND_P90 range.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies varied in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, leading to heterogeneity.\" (Limitations)\n    *   **Why problematic:** Phrases like 'treatment allocation', 'risk of bias due to lack of blinding', and 'heterogeneity' are jargon and are not explained, making the sentence very difficult for a lay reader.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, participants might have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect results. The studies also differed in who participated and how treatments were given, making it harder to combine their findings.\"\n3.  **Reduce Noun-Heavy Phrasing:** The text often uses noun forms where verbs would be more direct and concise, contributing to wordiness. The 'nouns' metric is 'P90'.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"By examining the evidence from randomized controlled trials, the authors sought to provide a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of using COCs containing drospirenone for PMS treatment.\" (Introduction)\n    *   **Why problematic:** This phrase is wordy and uses noun forms ('understanding') instead of more direct verbs.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"By examining evidence from randomised controlled trials, the authors aimed to clearly explain the benefits and drawbacks of using COCs with drospirenone for PMS.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Twelve out of eighteen evaluated features fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 percentile ranges, suggesting the text is considerably more complex than typical PLS documents. Specifically, readability indices such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (14.7), Automated Readability Index (16.2), Gunning Fog Index (19.8), and SMOG Index (15.3) are all well above the median for PLS texts, indicating a higher educational attainment is needed to understand the text. Sentence structure is problematic with a high average of 26.1 words per sentence and 24 instances of passive voice (BEYOND_P90). Vocabulary complexity is also high, with a large number of complex words (158) and long words (231), and a high Dale-Chall readability score (8.11), all contributing to the overall difficulty. These deviations suggest that the text is likely challenging for a lay audience to read and comprehend."
