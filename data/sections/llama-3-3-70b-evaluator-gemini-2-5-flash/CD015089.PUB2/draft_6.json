  "draft": "How accurate are tests of eye movement (the HINTS examination) for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness? We looked at how well these tests can identify the cause of severe dizziness. \n- The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for severe dizziness when performed by trained clinicians. However, the evidence is not very strong, so we are not very confident in these findings.\n- No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem? Acute vestibular syndrome is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. Acute vestibular syndrome can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome? Diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome can be challenging. Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests can find a 'central cause' (a problem in the brain) for severe dizziness. Finding the correct cause is important for getting the right treatment.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use? We searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? We found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central etiology for acute vestibular syndrome. When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test correctly identified a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome in about 94 out of 100 people who had one.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of overly technical vocabulary, an incomplete presentation of the main result, and some long, complex sentences that could be simplified. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much easier for patients and the public to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace Technical Terms with Simpler Words**\n\nSome words are too technical for a general audience. Using simpler, everyday language will make the text more accessible.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central **etiology** for acute vestibular syndrome.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Etiology' is medical jargon for 'cause'. The summary already uses the word 'cause' in other places, so introducing a technical synonym is confusing.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies looked at how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations could find a central **cause** for acute vestibular syndrome.\"\n\n**2. Provide a More Complete Picture of Test Accuracy**\n\nThe results section only explains how well the test identifies people who *have* a central cause (sensitivity), but not how well it rules out people who *don't* (specificity). Both are needed to understand a test's accuracy.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test correctly identified a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome in about 94 out of 100 people who had one.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This only tells half the story. Readers also need to know if the test correctly gives a negative result for people without the condition.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test:\n- Correctly identified a central cause in about 94 out of 100 people who had one.\n- Correctly ruled out a central cause in about 87 out of 100 people who did not have one.\"\n\n**3. Break Down Long, Complex Sentences**\n\nSome sentences contain multiple complex ideas, making them difficult to follow. Breaking them into shorter, more focused sentences improves readability.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long (38 words) and starts with a passive construction ('technique used is'). It packs the definition and the components of the test into one sentence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Clinicians can use the HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew) examination to check for a central cause. This test has three parts: checking how the eyes move when the head is turned, looking at involuntary eye movements, and seeing if the eyes are aligned.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with metrics like words_per_sentence (17.57) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.23) falling in the best quartile. However, the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics (SMOG index, complex words, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words) are in the P90 range, indicating the language is more technical and uses more long, complex words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the recommendation to simplify vocabulary."
