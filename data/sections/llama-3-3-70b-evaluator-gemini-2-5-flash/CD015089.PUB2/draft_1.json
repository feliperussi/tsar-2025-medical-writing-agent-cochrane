It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n### What are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome?\nDiagnosing the cause of AVS can be challenging. Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of AVS, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. The HINTS examination was assessed in 12 studies with 1890 participants, while the HINTS Plus examination was assessed in 5 studies with 451 participants. There was no information available on the duration of the studies, as this was a diagnostic test accuracy review. Additionally, there was no overview of study funding sources provided in the abstract. The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may help identify a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome. However, it is unclear if these examinations have an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

However, several key areas need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for a patient audience, aligning with Cochrane guidelines. The subheadings for 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions, which is a critical deviation from the style guide. Additionally, the text contains overly long and complex sentences, particularly in the Key Messages, and a high density of passive voice, nominalizations, and complex vocabulary.",

Metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns include: passive voice (25.0, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (26.0, P90), nouns (218.0, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.7, BEYOND_P90), Dale-Chall complex words (292.0, BEYOND_P90), complex words (167.0, BEYOND_P90), and long words (242.0, BEYOND_P90). These deviations suggest the text is more complex and less direct than typical Plain Language Summaries."
