  "draft": "How accurate are tests of eye movement (the HINTS examination) for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness? \nWe looked at how well these tests can identify the cause of severe dizziness. \n- The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for severe dizziness when performed by trained clinicians. \n- No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem? \nAcute vestibular syndrome is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. \nIt's a common reason for people to seek medical care. \nAcute vestibular syndrome can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. \nDetermining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome? \nDiagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome can be challenging. \nClinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. \nOne examination technique used is the HINTS examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests can find a 'central cause' (a problem in the brain) for severe dizziness. \nFinding the correct cause is important for getting the right treatment.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use? \nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. \nThe mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. \nMost studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. \nThe studies looked at how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations could find a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome. \nWhen performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test:\n- Correctly identified a central cause in about 94 out of 100 people who had one.\n- Correctly ruled out a central cause in about 87 out of 100 people who did not have one.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and easy to read, but it is not approved because it omits key findings from the review and contains some misleading phrasing. The most critical issue is that the results section only mentions the standard HINTS test, leaving out all findings related to the HINTS Plus and video-assisted examinations, which were a key part of the review's objectives. Additionally, the explanation of 'blinding' in the limitations is confusing for this type of study, and a key message about harms is phrased more strongly than the source material supports. Please see the detailed feedback for specific suggestions to address these points.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile (P25/P75), indicating excellent readability, simple sentence structure, and appropriate vocabulary choice. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 10.44 (P25) and the average words per sentence is 18.52 (P25). However, these strong metrics do not reflect the critical content omissions and clarity issues identified in the editorial review."
