  "draft": "How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations (tests that check how the eyes move and are aligned) for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\nWe looked at how well these tests can identify the cause of severe dizziness. \n- The HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations) and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause (a cause related to the central nervous system, such as a stroke) for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, a condition characterized by severe dizziness), especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department.\n- No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations in various situations.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome?\nDiagnosing the cause of AVS can be challenging. Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of AVS, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. The HINTS examination was assessed in 12 studies with 1890 participants, while the HINTS Plus examination was assessed in 5 studies with 451 participants.\n\nThe clinical HINTS examination was 94.0% sensitive and 86.9% specific, meaning it correctly identified a central cause in about 94 out of 100 people who had one and correctly ruled out a central cause in about 87 out of 100 people who did not have one. The video-assisted HINTS examination had a sensitivity of 85.0% to 100% and a specificity of 38.9% to 100%. The clinical HINTS Plus examination was 95.3% sensitive and 72.9% specific. The video-assisted HINTS Plus examination had a sensitivity of 85.0% to 93.8% and a specificity of 28.6% to 38.9%.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nFuture research should include more high-quality studies of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examination, assessment of inter-rater reliability across users, accuracy across different providers, specialties, and experience, and direct comparison with no HINTS or MRI to assess the effect on clinical care.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions for clarity and accuracy before it can be approved. The most critical issue is that the key messages do not mention that the evidence is of low certainty, which could mislead the reader about how much confidence we have in the findings. Additionally, the results section presents a dense block of statistics that is difficult for a lay audience to understand. Simplifying the vocabulary and sentence structure will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Add the low certainty of evidence to the key messages.** This is a critical omission that affects the reader's understanding of the review's conclusions.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The HINTS... and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause... for acute vestibular syndrome...\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** This statement sounds more confident than the evidence allows. The original review concluded the evidence was of 'low certainty', which is a crucial finding for the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The HINTS... and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause... for acute vestibular syndrome..., **but the evidence is of low certainty, which means we are not very confident in these findings.**\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the presentation of the results.** The current format is a dense block of statistics that is overwhelming for a non-technical reader.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The clinical HINTS examination was 94.0% sensitive and 86.9% specific... The video-assisted HINTS examination had a sensitivity of 85.0% to 100% and a specificity of 38.9% to 100%. The clinical HINTS Plus examination was 95.3% sensitive and 72.9% specific...\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** Presenting four sets of sensitivity and specificity data in one paragraph is confusing. It's better to focus on the main finding and summarize the rest.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The main test, called the clinical HINTS examination, gave an accurate result for most people.\n    - It correctly identified a central cause (like a stroke) in about 94 out of 100 people who had one.\n    - It correctly ruled out a central cause in about 87 out of 100 people who did not have one.\n    Adding a hearing test (HINTS Plus) or using video goggles gave similar, but more varied, results. However, we have less confidence in the evidence for these other tests.\"\n\n3.  **Replace complex, noun-heavy phrases with simpler, verb-focused language.** This will make the text more direct and easier to read.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations...\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** Phrases like \"diagnostic accuracy\" are jargon. Using a simpler verb makes the sentence more active and clear. This issue is reflected in the high `nominalization` and `complex_words` scores.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The review authors wanted to find out how accurately the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations can identify a central cause of AVS.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and structure metrics are within the median range, the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including `complex_words`, `long_words`, `nominalization`, and the `smog_index`, are beyond the 90th percentile. This indicates the text uses too many multi-syllable words, technical terms, and noun-based phrases for a lay audience, supporting the need to simplify the results and technical descriptions."
