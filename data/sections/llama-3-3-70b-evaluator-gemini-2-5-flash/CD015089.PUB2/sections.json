  "key_messages": [
    "The HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations) and HINTS Plus examinations, which are tests used to check how the eyes move and are aligned (nystagmus refers to involuntary eye movements, and test of skew refers to assessing whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned), seem to be good at identifying a central cause (a cause related to the central nervous system, such as a stroke) for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, a condition characterized by severe dizziness), especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department, but the evidence is not very strong, meaning we are not very confident in these findings.",
    "No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms, especially in different settings and with different types of healthcare providers.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations in various situations, such as in different healthcare settings, with different types of providers, and using video assistance, to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with acute vestibular syndrome."

      "subheading": "What is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central."

      "subheading": "What are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome?",
      "content": "Diagnosing the cause of AVS can be challenging. Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of AVS, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. The HINTS examination was assessed in 12 studies with 1890 participants, while the HINTS Plus examination was assessed in 5 studies with 451 participants. There was no information available on the duration of the studies, as this was a diagnostic test accuracy review. Additionally, there was no overview of study funding sources provided in the abstract. The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may help identify a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome. However, it is unclear if these examinations have an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.",
