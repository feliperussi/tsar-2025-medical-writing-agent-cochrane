  "draft": "How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\nWe looked at how well these tests can identify the cause of severe dizziness. \n- The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome, especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department. \n- No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms, especially in different settings and with different types of healthcare providers.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations in various situations.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome?\nDiagnosing the cause of AVS can be challenging. Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of AVS, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check for factual accuracy because it omits the main findings of the review (the diagnostic accuracy results) and the low certainty of the evidence, which are essential for reader understanding. Below are the 3 most important improvements needed to make the summary clear and accurate for patients.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Add the Low Certainty of Evidence to the Key Message**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at least identifying a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome, especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This statement is misleadingly positive. The original abstract and source material both emphasize that the evidence is of low certainty. Omitting this gives readers a false sense of confidence in the test's accuracy.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome (a cause related to the brain, such as a stroke), especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department. **However, the evidence is not very strong, so we are not very confident in these findings.**\"\n\n**2. Include the Main Findings in the Results Section**\n\n*   **Problematic Section:** The 'What did we find?' section describes the studies and participants but gives no information about how accurate the tests were. It states that the studies \"assessed the diagnostic accuracy\" but never presents the results of that assessment.\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is the most important part of the review. Readers want to know the results, not just that a study was conducted. Leaving this out makes the summary incomplete and unhelpful.\n*   **Suggested Addition:** You should add a simplified version of the main results. For example: \"When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test correctly identified a central cause of AVS in about 94 out of 100 people who had one. However, the test was less accurate at ruling out a central cause, and sometimes gave a false alarm.\"\n\n**3. Simplify Complex and Technical Language**\n\n*   **Problematic Phrases:** The text frequently uses technical terms and noun-heavy phrases like \"identifying a central etiology for AVS,\" \"examination findings,\" and \"involuntary eye movements.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This language is difficult for a lay audience to understand and makes the text feel dense and academic. The evaluation metrics confirm this, showing high scores for complex words, long words, and nouns.\n*   **Suggested Rewrites:**\n    *   Instead of \"...for identifying a central etiology for AVS,\" use \"...for identifying a central **cause** for AVS.\"\n    *   Instead of \"Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and the advanced imaging...\" try \"Doctors find the cause by looking at a person's medical history and risk factors, doing a physical exam, or using scans like an MRI.\"\n    *   In the title, add a simple explanation, as suggested by the source material: \"How accurate are the HINTS examinations **(tests that check how the eyes move)** for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\"\n\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with an average sentence length in the best quartile (19 words). However, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating the text has a higher number of nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical terms and rephrase noun-heavy sentences to improve readability for a lay audience."
