  "draft": "How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\nWe looked at how well these tests can identify the cause of severe dizziness. \n- The HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations) and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome, especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department.\n- No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?\nAcute vestibular syndrome is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. Acute vestibular syndrome can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome?\nDiagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome can be challenging. Clinicians use various methods, including risk factors, patient history, examination findings, and advanced imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the cause. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central etiology for acute vestibular syndrome. When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test correctly identified a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome in about 94 out of 100 people who had one.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some key improvements before it can be approved. The main issue is that a key message misrepresents the strength of the evidence by omitting the low certainty of the findings. Additionally, the summary uses complex and technical language that could be simplified for a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Add the low certainty of evidence to the key message.** The current version sounds more confident than the research supports. This is a crucial piece of information for readers.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- The HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations) and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome, especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause for severe dizziness when performed by trained clinicians. **However, the evidence is not very strong, so we are not very confident in these findings.**\"\n\n2. **Simplify the title and define technical terms earlier.** The title contains three technical terms without immediate explanation, which can be intimidating for readers.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"How accurate are tests of eye movement (the HINTS examination) for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\"\n\n3. **Reduce complex vocabulary and repetitive sentences.** Several sections use formal, multi-syllable words and repeat the same idea in consecutive sentences, making the text dense and difficult to read.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests can find a 'central cause' (a problem in the brain) for severe dizziness. Finding the correct cause is important for getting the right treatment.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft uses a high number of complex, long, and uncommon words, contributing to a high SMOG index (a measure of readability).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 72% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, SMOG index, complex words (Dale-Chall), complex words (3+ syllables), and long words—are in the P90 range, indicating the text is much denser and uses more difficult vocabulary than a typical Plain Language Summary."
