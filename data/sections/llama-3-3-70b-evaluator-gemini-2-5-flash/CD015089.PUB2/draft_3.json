  "draft": "How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations (tests that check how the eyes move and are aligned) for diagnosing the cause of severe dizziness?\nWe looked at how well these tests can identify the cause of severe dizziness. \n- The HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations) and HINTS Plus examinations seem to be good at identifying a central cause (a cause related to the brain, such as a stroke) for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, a condition characterized by severe dizziness), especially when performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department, but the evidence is not very strong, meaning we are not very confident in these findings.\n- No harmful effects of using these examinations were reported in the studies, but more research is needed to confirm their benefits and potential harms, especially in different settings and with different types of healthcare providers.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies to better understand the accuracy and usefulness of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations in various situations, such as in different healthcare settings, with different types of providers, and using video assistance, to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with acute vestibular syndrome.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) problems. Determining the cause is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the cause is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the challenges in diagnosing the cause of acute vestibular syndrome?\nDiagnosing the cause of AVS can be challenging. Doctors find the cause by looking at a person's medical history and risk factors, doing a physical exam, or using scans like an MRI. One examination technique used is the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination, which includes assessing eye movements in response to head turns, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with a central cause of AVS, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS test correctly identified a central cause of AVS in about 94 out of 100 people who had one. However, the test was less accurate at ruling out a central cause, and sometimes gave a false alarm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The language is often too academic, with long, complex sentences, excessive passive voice, and unnecessary jargon. This makes key sections, especially the 'Key Messages', difficult to understand. The high number of complex words and passive constructions, as confirmed by the linguistic analysis, creates a barrier for readers. To be approved, the summary must be revised to use shorter sentences, simpler words, and a more direct, active voice.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, but with significant deviations in key areas of complexity and style. While sentence length and basic readability scores are within the median range (P50), seven other metrics are in the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex and academic than a typical PLS. Specifically, the draft has a high number of passive voice constructions (20), nominalizations (22), complex words (143), and long words (206). These scores suggest the text would benefit from simplification of vocabulary and sentence structure to better meet the needs of a lay audience."
