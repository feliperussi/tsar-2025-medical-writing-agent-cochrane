  "draft": "How accurate are toe-brachial index (a test that compares blood pressure in the toes and arms) and toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure of blood in the toes) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced)?\n\nKey messages:\n- The accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future research should focus on determining the diagnostic test accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure with greater certainty, using robust methods and clear reporting.\n- Further studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits and potential harms of these diagnostic tests, particularly in different populations and settings.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPeripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced. This happens when the blood vessels (arteries) become narrow from a buildup of fatty plaque. Reduced blood flow can cause serious problems, including pain when walking (claudication), wounds that don't heal, or dead tissue (gangrene). It also increases the risk of other serious health problems (morbidity) and death (mortality).\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease accurately?\nWhen doctors diagnose PAD accurately and early, they can act to prevent complications. They can recommend treatments to slow the disease down or intervene with other procedures when needed.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of toe systolic blood pressure and toe-brachial index for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of these two tests, and investigate possible sources of differences in test accuracy.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure in detecting peripheral arterial disease. The search combined keywords, MeSH terms, and synonyms related to these tests, PAD, and diagnostic accuracy, without language or date restrictions.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that compared toe-brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure against a reference standard (e.g., angiography, duplex ultrasound) for PAD diagnosis. We only included studies that gave us enough information to judge how well the tests worked.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with peripheral arterial disease. Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as a reference standard. The evidence base to support the use of these tests to identify PAD is limited. Whilst both tests are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited due to generally low methodological quality of the studies, poor reporting of participant recruitment and blinding between index test and reference standard, and very small study sizes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions for factual accuracy and clarity before it can be approved. The main issues are a misleading statement about the study participants, overly complex vocabulary, and dense, noun-heavy sentences that make key messages difficult to understand. Focusing on these areas will significantly improve readability for patients and the public.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the description of study participants.** The current text incorrectly states that all participants had PAD, which is misleading for a review about diagnostic testing.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with peripheral arterial disease.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** In a diagnostic accuracy study, participants are people who are being tested *for* a condition; they do not all have it. This distinction is critical for readers to understand the purpose of the research.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found 18 studies in which these tests were used on a total of 2631 people to see if they had peripheral arterial disease.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and abstract language.** Several sentences use technical or formal language where simpler, more direct words would be clearer for a lay audience.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on determining the diagnostic test accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure with greater certainty, using robust methods and clear reporting.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"diagnostic test accuracy,\" \"greater certainty,\" and \"robust methods\" are jargon. This makes the conclusion hard to digest. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing the number of complex and long words is much higher than in typical summaries.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should use stronger methods and report their results clearly to find out how accurate these tests really are.\"\n\n3. **Rewrite noun-heavy sentences to be more direct.** Some sentences are difficult to read because they are built around abstract nouns instead of active verbs.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited due to generally low methodological quality of the studies, poor reporting of participant recruitment and blinding between index test and reference standard, and very small study sizes.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is dense and passive. Using verbs instead of nouns like \"reporting\" and \"recruitment\" makes the meaning clearer. The metrics confirm this is a pattern, with the `nouns` count being unusually high.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were not well-designed. For example, the researchers did not clearly report how they selected participants. Also, in some studies, the person interpreting the test may have known the results of other medical tests, which could have biased the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in terms of sentence length and structure (words_per_sentence is P25). However, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating the text has a much higher density of nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This results in a high SMOG index (P90), suggesting the text may be difficult for the intended audience to read and understand."
