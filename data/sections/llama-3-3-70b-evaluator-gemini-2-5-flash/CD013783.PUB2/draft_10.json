  "draft": "How accurate are toe-brachial index (a test that compares blood pressure in the toes and arms) and toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure of blood in the toes) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that the accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future studies should use stronger methods and report their results clearly to find out how accurate these tests really are.\n- Further studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits and potential harms of these diagnostic tests, particularly in different populations and settings.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrow. This is caused by a buildup of fatty material called plaque. Reduced blood flow can lead to problems like pain when walking, pain even at rest, and wounds that don't heal. In severe cases, it can lead to amputation. PAD also increases the risk of serious heart problems and death.\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease accurately?\nFinding PAD early and accurately helps doctors choose the right treatments. This can prevent problems from getting worse, slow the disease down, or show when other action is needed.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of toe systolic blood pressure and toe-brachial index for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of these two tests, and investigate possible sources of differences in test accuracy.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe looked for studies that compared the toe-brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure tests against a reliable, standard method for diagnosing PAD (like an ultrasound). To be included, studies needed to provide enough data for us to judge the accuracy of the tests.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included studies that compared these tests to a standard method for diagnosing PAD. These studies had to give us enough information to understand how well the tests worked.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with peripheral arterial disease. Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as a standard method for diagnosing PAD. The evidence base to support the use of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure to identify PAD is limited. While both tests are used extensively in clinics, their overall performance remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited due to the low quality of the studies, poor reporting of how participants were chosen, and very small study sizes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and structure for the reader. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Combine repetitive 'Methods' sections.** The sections 'How did we search for evidence?' and 'What were the inclusion criteria for the studies?' say almost the same thing. This is confusing and should be merged into a single, clear section.\n    *   **Problem:** The two sections are nearly identical: 'We looked for studies that compared the...tests against a reliable, standard method...studies needed to provide enough data...' and 'We included studies that compared these tests to a standard method...studies had to give us enough information...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Combine them under one heading like 'How did we find the evidence?'. For example: 'We searched for studies that compared the toe-brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure tests against a reliable, standard method for diagnosing PAD (like an ultrasound). We only included studies that provided enough data for us to judge the accuracy of the tests.'\n\n2. **Make the 'Aims' section more direct and personal.** The answer to 'What did the review authors want to find out?' is a bit formal and uses technical phrasing.\n    *   **Problem:** 'The review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of toe systolic blood pressure and toe-brachial index for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of these two tests, and investigate possible sources of differences in test accuracy.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using 'we' and simpler language, as recommended in the style guide. For example: 'We wanted to find out how accurate these two tests are for diagnosing PAD. We also wanted to compare them and see what factors might change their accuracy.'\n\n3. **Clarify the main finding in the 'Results' section.** The language used to describe the results is slightly vague for a lay audience.\n    *   **Problem:** '...their overall performance remains uncertain.' The term 'performance' can be ambiguous.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more direct about what is uncertain. For example: 'Based on these studies, we cannot be certain how well these tests work for finding PAD. Although the tests are used a lot in clinics, the evidence we found is not strong enough to confirm their accuracy.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within or better than the median range for our corpus, with 83% in the best quartile. Readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 9.95) and sentence length (17.7 words/sentence) are excellent. These strong metrics indicate a solid foundation, but they do not capture structural issues like the repetitive 'Methods' sections or the need for more direct, patient-friendly phrasing in key sentences."
