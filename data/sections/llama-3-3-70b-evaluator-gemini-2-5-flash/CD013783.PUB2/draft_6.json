  "draft": "How accurate are toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- The accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future studies should use stronger methods and report their results clearly to find out how accurate these tests really are.\n- Further studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits and potential harms of these diagnostic tests, particularly in different populations and settings.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPeripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced. This happens when the blood vessels (arteries) become narrow from a buildup of fatty plaque. Reduced blood flow can cause serious problems, including pain when walking, wounds that don't heal, or dead tissue. It also increases the risk of other serious health problems and death.\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease accurately?\nWhen doctors diagnose PAD accurately and early, they can act to prevent complications. They can recommend treatments to slow the disease down or intervene with other procedures when needed.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of toe systolic blood pressure and toe-brachial index for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of these two tests, and investigate possible sources of differences in test accuracy.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that checked how well these two tests work for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that compared toe-brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure against a reference standard for PAD diagnosis. We only included studies that gave us enough information to judge how well the tests worked.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that tested a total of 2631 people for peripheral arterial disease. Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as a reference standard. The evidence base to support the use of these tests to identify PAD is limited. Whilst both tests are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were not well-designed. For example, the researchers did not clearly report how they selected participants. Also, in some studies, the person interpreting the test may have known the results of other medical tests, which could have biased the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

The main issue is that it fails to define the two key tests it is about—'toe-brachial index' and 'toe systolic blood pressure'—leaving a lay reader confused from the very beginning. Additionally, some sections use technical jargon like 'reference standard' without explanation and the main results could be stated more directly. Please see the detailed feedback for specific suggestions to address these points.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile or median ranges, indicating excellent sentence structure, readability scores, and use of active voice. However, these strong metrics do not capture the most critical issue: the failure to define core technical terms for a lay audience. This highlights that while metrics can confirm good structure, they cannot replace an editorial review for clarity and context."
