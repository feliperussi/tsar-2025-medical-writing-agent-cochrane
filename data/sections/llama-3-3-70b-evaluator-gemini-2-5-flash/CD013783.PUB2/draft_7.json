  "draft": "How accurate are toe-brachial index (a test that compares blood pressure in the toes and arms) and toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure of blood in the toes) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced)?\n\nKey messages:\n- The accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future studies should use stronger methods and report their results clearly to find out how accurate these tests really are.\n- Further studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits and potential harms of these diagnostic tests, particularly in different populations and settings.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries in the lower limbs become narrowed due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease (a buildup of fatty plaque), reducing blood flow to the legs. This can cause complications such as claudication pain (pain when walking), rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity (disease) and mortality (death). PAD is common, affecting an estimated 236 million people worldwide, and is often associated with advanced age, smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and concomitant cardiovascular disease (heart disease).\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease accurately?\nAccurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression, or intervene when indicated. Diagnostic tests such as the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are used to detect PAD, but their accuracy is uncertain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP, and investigate possible sources of heterogeneity (differences) in test accuracy, including patient group, equipment used, positivity threshold, and reference standard.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) in detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The search combined keywords, MeSH terms, and synonyms related to TBI, TSBP, PAD, and diagnostic accuracy, without language or date restrictions.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that compared TBI or TSBP against a reference standard (e.g., angiography, duplex ultrasound) for PAD diagnosis. Studies had to report sufficient data to construct 2 x 2 tables (true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives). Exclusion criteria were case reports, reviews, and studies lacking a reference standard.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with peripheral arterial disease. Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as a reference standard. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited due to generally low methodological quality of the studies, poor reporting of participant recruitment and blinding between index test and reference standard, and very small study sizes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and meets the basic requirements for structure and accuracy. However, it needs significant revision to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of overly technical language, inclusion of unnecessary methodological details, and complex sentence structures that make the text difficult to understand. The summary currently reads more like a simplified abstract for a professional audience rather than a true plain language summary for patients and their families. The following 3 improvements will have the biggest impact on making the summary more accessible.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify complex medical definitions.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries in the lower limbs become narrowed due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease (a buildup of fatty plaque), reducing blood flow to the legs. This can cause complications such as claudication pain (pain when walking), rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity (disease) and mortality (death).\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence is 48 words long and packed with technical terms. While definitions are provided, the density is overwhelming for a reader. Terms like 'atherosclerotic occlusive disease', 'claudication pain', and 'cardiovascular morbidity and mortality' create a high cognitive load.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrow. This is caused by a buildup of fatty material called plaque. Reduced blood flow can lead to problems like pain when walking, pain even at rest, and wounds that don't heal. In severe cases, it can lead to amputation. PAD also increases the risk of serious heart problems and death.\"\n\n**2. Remove technical details from the methods sections.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"We included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that compared TBI or TSBP against a reference standard (e.g., angiography, duplex ultrasound) for PAD diagnosis. Studies had to report sufficient data to construct 2 x 2 tables (true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives).\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This level of detail is for researchers, not patients. Terms like 'cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies', 'reference standard', and '2 x 2 tables' are jargon that add complexity without improving a lay reader's understanding of what was done.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We looked for studies that compared the TBI or TSBP tests against a reliable, standard method for diagnosing PAD (like an ultrasound). To be included, studies needed to provide enough data for us to judge the accuracy of the tests.\"\n\n**3. Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression, or intervene when indicated.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is abstract and passive due to its reliance on nouns ('detection', 'implementation', 'management', 'progression'). Using more direct verbs makes the information clearer and more engaging.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Finding PAD early and accurately helps doctors choose the right treatments. This can prevent problems from getting worse, slow the disease down, or show when other action is needed.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis confirms that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. The summary's readability is low, with several metrics indicating high complexity (SMOG Index: BEYOND_P90, Gunning Fog Index: P90). This is driven by a very high number of complex and long words (complex_words and long_words: BEYOND_P90), which makes the text difficult for a lay audience to process. Additionally, the high count of nominalizations (P90) and nouns (P90) supports the editorial finding that sentences are often abstract and lack direct, active verbs. Addressing the vocabulary and sentence structure will be key to improving this summary."
