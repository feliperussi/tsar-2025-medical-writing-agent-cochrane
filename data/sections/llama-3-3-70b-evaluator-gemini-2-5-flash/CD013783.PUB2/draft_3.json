  "draft": "How accurate are toe-brachial index (a test that compares blood pressure in the toes and arms) and toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure of blood in the toes) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced)?\n\nKey messages:\n- The accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future research should focus on determining the diagnostic test accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure with greater certainty, using robust methods and clear reporting.\n- Further studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits and potential harms of these diagnostic tests, particularly in different populations and settings.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries in the lower limbs become narrowed due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease (a buildup of plaque in the arteries), reducing blood flow to the legs. This can cause complications such as claudication pain (pain in the legs when walking), rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity (disease) and mortality (death). PAD is common, affecting an estimated 236 million people worldwide, and is often associated with advanced age, smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and concomitant cardiovascular disease (heart disease).\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease accurately?\nAccurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression, or intervene when indicated. Diagnostic tests such as the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are used to detect PAD, but their accuracy is uncertain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP, and investigate possible sources of heterogeneity (differences) in test accuracy, including patient group, equipment used, positivity threshold, and reference standard.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) in detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The search combined keywords, MeSH terms, and synonyms related to TBI, TSBP, PAD, and diagnostic accuracy, without language or date restrictions.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that compared TBI or TSBP against a reference standard (e.g., angiography, duplex ultrasound) for PAD diagnosis. Studies had to report sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 tables (true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives). Exclusion criteria were case reports, reviews, and studies lacking a reference standard.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with peripheral arterial disease. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world. Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as a reference standard. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited due to generally low methodological quality of the studies, poor reporting of participant recruitment and blinding between index test and reference standard, and very small study sizes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and factually accurate, but it needs significant revision to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The language is too technical and dense, making it difficult for patients to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify dense, technical descriptions.** The opening paragraph is overloaded with jargon. Breaking it into shorter sentences and explaining terms more simply will help readers grasp the basics before moving on.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries in the lower limbs become narrowed due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease (a buildup of plaque in the arteries), reducing blood flow to the legs. This can cause complications such as claudication pain (pain in the legs when walking), rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity (disease) and mortality (death).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a condition where blood flow to the legs is reduced. This happens when the blood vessels (arteries) become narrow from a buildup of fatty plaque. Reduced blood flow can cause serious problems, including pain when walking (claudication), wounds that don't heal, or dead tissue (gangrene). It also increases the risk of other serious health problems (morbidity) and death (mortality).\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of abstract nouns.** Sentences are often built around abstract nouns (nominalizations), which makes them passive and hard to follow. Rephrasing with simple, direct verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression, or intervene when indicated.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"When doctors diagnose PAD accurately and early, they can act to prevent complications. They can recommend treatments to slow the disease down or intervene with other procedures when needed.\"\n\n3. **Explain methods in plain language.** The methods section contains technical details that are not meaningful to a lay reader and should be rephrased to explain the purpose behind the action.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Studies had to report sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 tables (true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We only included studies that gave us enough information to judge how well the tests worked. The studies had to report how many people with PAD the test correctly identified, and how many people without PAD the test correctly cleared.\"\n\nAddressing these points will significantly improve readability. The current draft's high number of complex words and difficult readability scores confirm that simplifying the language is the highest priority.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 10 of 18 metrics falling outside the expected range. The text scores as difficult to read across multiple indices (Gunning Fog, SMOG, Dale-Chall) and is particularly high in complex words, long words, and total nouns, with five metrics rated 'BEYOND_P90'. This suggests the vocabulary is too technical and the sentence structure too dense for a lay audience."
