  "draft": "# What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n- \n**Introduction**\n## What are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n## Why are general health checks a problem?\nDespite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing mortality or morbidity. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. They also sought to explore the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By examining the qualitative evidence, the authors hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous Cochrane review on the effectiveness of general health checks.\n**Methods**\n## Search Strategy\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and grey‑literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters and was limited to studies published in English.\n## Data Synthesis\nRelevant studies were screened, and data were extracted on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We performed a thematic synthesis, grouping similar findings across studies to generate overarching themes such as perceived benefits, barriers, and recommendations for implementation.\n## Confidence Assessment\nThe confidence in each synthesized finding was evaluated using the GRADE‑CERQual approach, considering methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy of data, and relevance. Findings were then graded as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 146 studies that involved stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors influencing the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The included studies were set in primary and community healthcare settings, workplace settings, and community settings.\n## Main results: General Health Checks\nGeneral health checks are valued by clients, healthcare providers, managers, and policymakers across different countries and settings, despite a lack of effectiveness shown in quantitative reviews. These checks help motivate clients to change their lifestyles and provide reassurance through professional confirmation. However, some clients are reluctant to attend due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care. The availability and accessibility of general health checks, as well as awareness systems, play significant roles in clients' decision-making. Healthcare providers consider it essential to have skilled and culturally competent providers, and clients appreciate a comprehensive approach with various tests. Innovative and diverse settings may improve access, and explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and participants were likely aware of their treatment allocation, introducing potential bias.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED. Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a critical formatting requirement. Additionally, the text contains excessive passive voice and nominalizations, leading to dense, less direct sentences. Readability scores are low due to long sentences and complex vocabulary, making the text challenging for a general audience. There are also instances of wordiness and a lack of sufficient white space between sections.\n\n**Top 5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Subheading Format:**\n    *   **Problem:** Many subheadings are statements, not questions, violating the style guide. For example, \"Search Strategy\", \"Data Synthesis\", \"Confidence Assessment\", \"Main results: General Health Checks\", \"Limitations\", and \"Currency\" are not questions.\n    *   **Why problematic:** Inconsistent formatting makes the text less engaging and harder to navigate for readers expecting a question-based structure.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite (examples):**\n        *   Change \"Search Strategy\" to \"How did we find the studies?\"\n        *   Change \"Data Synthesis\" to \"How did we combine the study findings?\"\n        *   Change \"Confidence Assessment\" to \"How confident are we in the findings?\"\n        *   Change \"Main results: General Health Checks\" to \"What did we find about general health checks?\"\n        *   Change \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of this evidence?\"\n        *   Change \"Currency\" to \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Passive Voice and Noun-Heavy Sentences:**\n    *   **Problem:** The draft frequently uses passive voice and nominalizations, making sentences less direct and harder to understand. For example, in \"Relevant studies were screened, and data were extracted on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We performed a thematic synthesis, grouping similar findings across studies to generate overarching themes such as perceived benefits, barriers, and recommendations for implementation.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** Passive voice obscures who is performing the action, and noun-heavy phrases increase cognitive load. The metrics show \"passive_voice\" (24.0, BEYOND_P90) and \"nominalization\" (21.0, P90) are significantly high.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We screened relevant studies and extracted data on participants, settings, and key themes about health check perceptions. We then grouped similar findings across studies to identify overarching themes like perceived benefits, barriers, and ways to improve implementation.\"\n\n3.  **Readability and Vocabulary Complexity:**\n    *   **Problem:** Sentences are often long and contain complex vocabulary, reducing overall readability. For example, \"The review authors aimed to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. They also sought to explore the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By examining the qualitative evidence, the authors hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous Cochrane review on the effectiveness of general health checks.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This paragraph is dense and uses terms like \"commissioning\", \"contextualize\", and \"effectiveness\" which may be challenging for a general audience. Multiple readability metrics (e.g., \"flesch_reading_ease\" 35.22, P25; \"smog_index\" 16.08, BEYOND_P90; \"complex_words\" 168.0, BEYOND_P90; \"words_per_sentence\" 23.59, P75) indicate high complexity.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The review authors wanted to find out how different groups, like healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, view and experience general health checks. They also looked at what influences whether these checks are ordered, provided, and used. By studying this qualitative evidence, the authors aimed to add to and explain the results of an earlier Cochrane review about how well general health checks work.\"\n\n4.  **Wordiness:**\n    *   **Problem:** Some phrases are unnecessarily wordy. For example, \"introducing potential bias\" in the Limitations section.\n    *   **Why problematic:** Wordiness makes the text less concise and can slow down reading comprehension.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, and participants probably knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\"\n\n5.  **Lack of White Space:**\n    *   **Problem:** There are missing blank lines between subheadings and the following paragraphs, and sometimes between paragraphs themselves.\n    *   **Why problematic:** This creates a dense block of text that is visually unappealing and harder to read, especially on screens. The style guide explicitly asks for blank lines.\n    *   **Suggested action:** Add a blank line after each subheading and between paragraphs to improve readability and adhere to the style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. While word count is within limits, only 38.9% of features fall into the best quartile. Seven metrics are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating significant deviation: passive voice (24.0, target <13.0), nouns (226.0, target <116.0), LIX (62.62, target <54.3), SMOG index (16.08, target <12.1), Dale-Chall complex words (299.0, target <160.0), complex words (168.0, target <84.0), and long words (267.0, target <122.0). Four other metrics are in the 90th percentile range: nominalization (21.0, target <13.0), automated readability index (16.14, target <13.6), Coleman-Liau index (15.12, target <12.7), and RIX (9.21, target <7.0). These deviations highlight a need to reduce passive constructions, simplify vocabulary, shorten sentences, and use more direct verbs."
