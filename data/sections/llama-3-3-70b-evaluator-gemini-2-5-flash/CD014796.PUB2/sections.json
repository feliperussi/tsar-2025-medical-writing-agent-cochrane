      "subheading": "What are general health checks?",
      "content": "General health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Why are general health checks a problem?",
      "content": "Despite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing mortality or morbidity. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. They also sought to explore the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By examining the qualitative evidence, the authors hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous Cochrane review on the effectiveness of general health checks."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and grey‑literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters and was limited to studies published in English."

      "subheading": "Data Synthesis",
      "content": "Relevant studies were screened, and data were extracted on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We performed a thematic synthesis, grouping similar findings across studies to generate overarching themes such as perceived benefits, barriers, and recommendations for implementation."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Confidence Assessment",
      "content": "The confidence in each synthesized finding was evaluated using the GRADE‑CERQual approach, considering methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy of data, and relevance. Findings were then graded as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 146 studies that involved stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors influencing the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The included studies were set in primary and community healthcare settings, workplace settings, and community settings."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: General Health Checks",
      "content": "General health checks are valued by clients, healthcare providers, managers, and policymakers across different countries and settings, despite a lack of effectiveness shown in quantitative reviews. These checks help motivate clients to change their lifestyles and provide reassurance through professional confirmation. However, some clients are reluctant to attend due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care. The availability and accessibility of general health checks, as well as awareness systems, play significant roles in clients' decision-making. Healthcare providers consider it essential to have skilled and culturally competent providers, and clients appreciate a comprehensive approach with various tests. Innovative and diverse settings may improve access, and explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks."
