  "draft": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nKey messages:\n- General health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers despite their limited effectiveness in reducing deaths or illness.\n- Whether people decide to get a health check often depends on how easy it is to access one and whether they know it is available.\n- Explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a series of tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nDespite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing deaths or illness. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. We also sought to explore the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By examining the qualitative evidence, we hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous review on the effectiveness of general health checks.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and grey-literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", and \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters. We considered studies conducted in any country, setting, and language.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe screened relevant studies and extracted data on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We then grouped similar findings across studies to identify overarching themes like perceived benefits, barriers, and ways to improve implementation.\n\nHow confident are we in the findings?\nWe rated our confidence in each finding. To do this, we looked at the methods of the original studies and how well their findings matched. We then graded our confidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 relevant studies and chose 36 of them for our analysis. These studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n- People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if reviews show they have little effect on overall death rates.\n- Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n- People felt it was important that health checks were easy to get and that providers were skilled and understood their cultural background.\n- Explaining test results clearly and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, which could affect the reliability of the findings.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. However, it is not yet approved because the vocabulary is often too technical for a general audience, which could prevent readers from understanding important information. Focusing on simplifying your word choice will make this an excellent summary.\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace technical jargon with simpler, everyday words.** The summary uses several abstract, technical terms that are common in research but may be unclear to patients and the public.\n   - **Example:** \"This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Commissioning,' 'delivery,' and 'uptake' are expert terms. Readers may not understand what they mean in a healthcare context.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This makes it important to understand why health checks are offered, how they are carried out, and why people decide to get them.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the description of the methods.** The current explanation uses research-specific language that will be unfamiliar to most people. The goal is to describe *what* you did in plain language, not just list the technical steps.\n   - **Example:** \"We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and grey-literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'grey-literature,' 'qualitative studies,' and 'stakeholders' perceptions' are jargon that can alienate or confuse readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched online medical databases and other reports to find studies that used interviews or surveys to understand people's experiences with general health checks.\"\n\n3. **Make the language more direct and active.** Some sentences are a bit wordy or use complex phrasing where a simpler construction would be clearer.\n   - **Example:** \"General health checks are a series of tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly indirect. Using simpler words makes the key message clearer and easier to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"General health checks are a series of tests to check the overall health of people who feel well and have no symptoms.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your focus on simplifying vocabulary is supported by the evaluation results. While sentence length is good, the analysis shows the text has a very high number of long and complex words (long_words: BEYOND_P90; complex_words, complex_words_dc, smog_index: all P90). Addressing the points above will significantly improve these scores and, more importantly, make the summary much clearer for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows that while the draft conforms well to typical patterns for sentence structure (e.g., 'words_per_sentence' is in the best quartile), it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, all related to word complexity and length ('long_words', 'complex_words', 'complex_words_dc', 'smog_index', 'nouns'). This indicates that the primary area for improvement is replacing technical, long, or uncommon words with simpler alternatives to enhance readability for a lay audience."
