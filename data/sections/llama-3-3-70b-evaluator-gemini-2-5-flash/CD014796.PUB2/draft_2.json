  "draft": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nDespite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing mortality or morbidity. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how different groups, like healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, view and experience general health checks. They also looked at what influences whether these checks are ordered, provided, and used. By studying this qualitative evidence, the authors aimed to add to and explain the results of an earlier Cochrane review about how well general health checks work.\n\nMethods\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and grey-literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters and was limited to studies published in English.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe screened relevant studies and extracted data on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We then grouped similar findings across studies to identify overarching themes like perceived benefits, barriers, and ways to improve implementation.\n\nHow confident are we in the findings?\nThe confidence in each synthesized finding was evaluated using the GRADE-CERQual approach, considering methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy of data, and relevance. Findings were then graded as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 studies that involved stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors influencing the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The included studies were set in primary and community healthcare settings, workplace settings, and community settings.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\nGeneral health checks are valued by clients, healthcare providers, managers, and policymakers across different countries and settings, despite a lack of effectiveness shown in quantitative reviews. These checks help motivate clients to change their lifestyles and provide reassurance through professional confirmation. However, some clients are reluctant to attend due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care. The availability and accessibility of general health checks, as well as awareness systems, play significant roles in clients' decision-making. Healthcare providers consider it essential to have skilled and culturally competent providers, and clients appreciate a comprehensive approach with various tests. Innovative and diverse settings may improve access, and explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, and participants probably knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails on several critical checks and requires significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Missing Section:** The 'Key Messages' section, which is a standard and essential part of a Plain Language Summary, is missing.\n2.  **Factual Inaccuracy (Search Methods):** The draft states the search was \"limited to studies published in English.\" However, the original abstract explicitly says, \"We considered studies conducted in any country, setting, and language.\" This is a direct contradiction.\n3.  **Misleading Limitations:** The 'Limitations' section mentions participants \"knew which treatment they were getting.\" This language is for clinical trials. For a qualitative review about perceptions, this is confusing and inappropriate, and it undermines the credibility of the summary.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Replace Technical Jargon:** The summary uses terms that are unclear to a general reader. This makes key concepts difficult to grasp.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"...factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Commissioning' and 'uptake' are technical terms. Readers won't understand what they mean in this context.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...factors that influence how health checks are planned, provided, and used by people.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Complex Sentences and Use Active Voice:** The methods section is overly technical and uses passive voice, which hides who is performing the action.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The confidence in each synthesized finding was evaluated using the GRADE-CERQual approach, considering methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy of data, and relevance.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is dense, passive, and lists abstract research concepts that are meaningless to a patient.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We rated our confidence in each finding. To do this, we looked at the methods of the original studies and how well their findings matched. We then graded our confidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\"\n\n3.  **Rewrite the 'Key Findings' to be More Direct:** The main results are presented in a single, dense paragraph that is hard to read.\n    *   **Problematic text:** The entire 'What are the key findings?' paragraph.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** It's a wall of text that mixes many different ideas. Breaking it into a bulleted list would make the main takeaways much clearer.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Structure the findings as a bulleted list using dashes:\n        - People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if reviews show they have little effect on overall death rates.\n        - Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n        - It was important to people that health checks were easy to access and that providers were skilled and culturally sensitive.\n        - Explaining test results clearly and providing recommendations were seen as key parts of a health check.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 33.3% of features in the best quartile. However, there is significant deviation in key areas related to complexity and style. Six metrics are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. These include high counts of passive voice, nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words (7+ characters). The SMOG index of 15.6 suggests a graduate-level reading ability is required, which is too high for a lay audience. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
