  "draft": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nKey messages:\n- People value general health checks for motivation and reassurance, even though they may not reduce deaths or illness.\n- Easy access to health checks and knowing they are available can influence whether people get them.\n- Clearly explaining test results and providing recommendations are important parts of general health checks.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are tests to check the overall health of people who feel well and have no symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nResearch shows that general health checks have little effect on reducing deaths or illness. This makes it important to understand why health checks are offered, how they are carried out, and why people decide to get them. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand how different groups, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. We also wanted to learn what affects why health checks are offered, how they are done, and why people choose to get them.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched online medical databases and other reports to find studies that used interviews or surveys to understand people's experiences with general health checks. We considered studies from any country, setting, and language.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe carefully analyzed the findings from all 36 studies. We grouped similar findings together to identify common themes about people's experiences. We then assessed our confidence in each main finding by looking at the quality of the studies and how consistent the results were.\n\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 relevant studies and chose 36 of them for our analysis. These studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n- People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if they have little effect on overall death rates.\n- Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n- People felt it was important that health checks were easy to get and that providers were skilled and understood their cultural background.\n- Clearly explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies included were small. Also, in some studies, people were aware of the study's purpose, which might have influenced their answers. Because of these limitations, we should be cautious about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a very strong and clear draft that meets all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. I'm marking it as 'NOT_APPROVED' to highlight three minor opportunities to improve clarity and flow for the reader. Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better.\n\n1. **Improve the logical flow between the Methods and Results sections.** The Methods section mentions the specific number of studies (36) before the Results section explains where that number comes from, which can be confusing for the reader.\n    - **Current text (in 'How did we combine the study findings?'):** \"output\": \"We carefully analyzed the findings from all 36 studies.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The reader has not yet been told that you found 146 studies and selected 36 for analysis. Introducing the number '36' here disrupts the narrative flow.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We carefully analyzed and combined the findings from the included studies.\" (This keeps the Methods section focused on the 'how', while the Results section correctly explains the 'what').\n\n2. **Clarify the language in the 'Limitations' section.** The explanation of bias is a bit abstract and could be made more concrete for a lay audience.\n    - **Current text:** \"...people were aware of the study's purpose, which might have influenced their answers.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The phrase 'influenced their answers' is vague. It's more helpful to explain *how* their answers might have been influenced.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...people were aware of the study's purpose. This might have led them to give the answers they thought the researchers wanted to hear.\"\n\n3. **Refine the description of the research methods for better accuracy.** The draft simplifies the methods in a way that isn't entirely comprehensive.\n    - **Current text:** \"...to find studies that used interviews or surveys to understand people's experiences...\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The original review included all 'qualitative methods', which is a broader category than just interviews and surveys (e.g., it could include focus groups).\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...to find studies that used qualitative methods, such as interviews or focus groups, to understand people's experiences...\"\n\nYour linguistic metrics are excellent, showing the text is very readable. The analysis did note a high number of nouns and long words, but your simple sentence structure prevents this from being a major issue. The small changes above will further improve an already high-quality summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling within the best quartile. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.16) and words per sentence (17.72) are excellent. The draft shows minor deviation from typical patterns in two areas: a high noun count (160.0, P90) and a high number of long words (168.0, P90). These do not critically impact readability but suggest opportunities for simplification."
