  "draft": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nKey Messages:\n- General health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers despite their limited effectiveness in reducing mortality or morbidity.\n- The availability and accessibility of health checks, as well as awareness systems, play significant roles in clients' decision-making.\n- Explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nDespite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing mortality or morbidity. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence how health checks are planned, provided, and used by people. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. They also sought to explore the factors that influence how health checks are planned, provided, and used by people, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By examining the qualitative evidence, the authors hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous Cochrane review on the effectiveness of general health checks.\n\nMethods\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and grey-literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters. We considered studies conducted in any country, setting, and language.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe screened relevant studies and extracted data on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We then grouped similar findings across studies to identify overarching themes like perceived benefits, barriers, and ways to improve implementation.\n\nHow confident are we in the findings?\nWe rated our confidence in each finding. To do this, we looked at the methods of the original studies and how well their findings matched. We then graded our confidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 studies that involved stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors influencing the planning, provision, and use of general health checks. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The included studies were set in primary and community healthcare settings, workplace settings, and community settings.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n- People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if reviews show they have little effect on overall death rates.\n- Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n- It was important to people that health checks were easy to access and that providers were skilled and culturally sensitive.\n- Explaining test results clearly and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, which could affect the reliability of the findings.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It requires revisions for factual accuracy and clarity before it can be published.\n\nHere are the 4 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct a Factual Error in the Methods:** The methods section incorrectly states that studies in any language were considered. This must be corrected to reflect the source material.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We considered studies conducted in any country, setting, and language.'\n    *   **Reason:** This is factually incorrect. The source material states the search was 'limited to studies published in English.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We looked for studies from any country or setting, but we only included studies published in English.'\n\n2. **Clarify the Number of Studies Analyzed:** The results section is misleading. It states that 146 studies were found but omits that only 36 were actually included in the analysis.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We found 146 studies that involved stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences...'\n    *   **Reason:** This implies all 146 studies formed the basis of the findings. The original abstract clarifies that only 36 were sampled for analysis, which is a crucial detail for the reader to understand the evidence base.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We found 146 relevant studies and chose 36 of them for our analysis. These studies explored...'\n\n3. **Simplify Complex, Academic Language:** The text often uses technical terms and abstract phrasing that will be difficult for a general audience to understand.\n    *   **Problem:** 'By examining the qualitative evidence, the authors hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous Cochrane review on the effectiveness of general health checks.'\n    *   **Reason:** Phrases like 'qualitative evidence', 'supplement and contextualize', and 'effectiveness' are jargon. This sentence reads like it's for researchers, not patients.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'By looking at people's experiences and opinions, we wanted to add more meaning to the results of a previous review that studied how well these health checks work.'\n\n4. **Use Active Voice to Improve Clarity:** The draft frequently uses passive voice, which can make sentences feel indirect and clunky. The style guide recommends using active voice.\n    *   **\n    *   **Problem:** 'Despite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing mortality or morbidity.'\n    *   **Reason:** The passive phrase 'have been found' is vague. Using active voice makes it clearer who did the action. It also provides an opportunity to simplify 'mortality or morbidity'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Even though they are common, a previous review found that general health checks have little or no effect on preventing deaths or illness.'\n\nThese issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the text uses significantly more complex words, long words, and passive constructions than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid are good (in the best 25% of the corpus), there are significant deviations in vocabulary and structure. The draft uses far more complex words, long words, and nouns than is typical, with metrics like `complex_words_dc`, `long_words`, and `nouns` falling 'Beyond P90'. Additionally, the `smog_index` is very high, and the use of `passive_voice` is in the P90 range. These results confirm the editorial feedback that the text's vocabulary is too academic and its sentence structures are often indirect, which harms readability for a lay audience."
