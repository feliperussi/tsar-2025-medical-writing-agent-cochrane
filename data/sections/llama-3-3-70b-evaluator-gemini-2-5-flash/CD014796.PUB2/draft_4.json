  "draft": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nKey Messages:\n- General health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers despite their limited effectiveness in reducing mortality or morbidity.\n- The availability and accessibility of health checks, as well as awareness systems, play significant roles in clients' decision-making.\n- Explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nA previous review found that general health checks have little or no effect on preventing deaths or illness. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence how health checks are planned, provided, and used by people. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. We also sought to explore the factors that influence how health checks are planned, provided, and used by people, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By looking at people's experiences and opinions, we wanted to add more meaning to the results of a previous review that studied how well these health checks work.\n\nMethods\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and grey-literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters. We looked for studies from any country or setting, but we only included studies published in English.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe screened relevant studies and extracted data on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We then grouped similar findings across studies to identify overarching themes like perceived benefits, barriers, and ways to improve implementation.\n\nHow confident are we in the findings?\nWe rated our confidence in each finding. To do this, we looked at the methods of the original studies and how well their findings matched. We then graded our confidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 relevant studies and chose 36 of them for our analysis. These studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n- People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if reviews show they have little effect on overall death rates.\n- Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n- It was important to people that health checks were easy to access and that providers were skilled and culturally sensitive.\n- Explaining test results clearly and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, which could affect the reliability of the findings.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

Additionally, while the sentence structure is good, the summary uses too many complex and technical words, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The feedback below outlines the required correction and the top 3 improvements needed to enhance clarity.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Error**\n*   **Problem:** The 'Methods' section incorrectly states a language limitation.\n*   **Quote:** \"We looked for studies from any country or setting, but we only included studies published in English.\"\n*   **Correction:** This contradicts the original abstract, which states, \"We considered studies conducted in any country, setting, and language.\" Please remove the incorrect statement about only including English-language studies.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Replace Technical Jargon with Plain Language**\n    *   **Problem:** The term \"mortality or morbidity\" is clinical jargon that is unclear to most patients.\n    *   **Quote:** \"General health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers despite their limited effectiveness in reducing mortality or morbidity.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"General health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers despite their limited effectiveness in reducing deaths or illness.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences**\n    *   **Problem:** Overusing abstract nouns makes sentences dense and hard to follow. This is reflected in the high noun count.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The availability and accessibility of health checks, as well as awareness systems, play significant roles in clients' decision-making.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Whether people decided to get a health check often depended on how easy it was to access one and whether they knew it was available.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Complex Vocabulary**\n    *   **Problem:** The summary contains many long, multi-syllable words where simpler alternatives exist, making it harder to read.\n    *   **Quote:** \"It was important to people that health checks were easy to access and that providers were skilled and culturally sensitive.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"People felt it was important that health checks were easy to get and that providers were skilled and understood their cultural background.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While sentence-level metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (18.11) and 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (10.51) are excellent and fall within the best quartile, the vocabulary is too complex for a plain language summary. Metrics for 'complex_words' (128), 'long_words' (224), and 'nouns' (206) are all significantly outside the typical range for a PLS (in the P90/Beyond_P90 categories). This indicates that while sentence structure is clear, the word choice is too technical and needs to be simplified to improve readability."
