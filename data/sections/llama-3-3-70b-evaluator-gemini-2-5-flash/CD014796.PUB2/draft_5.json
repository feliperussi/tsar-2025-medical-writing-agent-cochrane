  "draft": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nKey Messages:\n- General health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers despite their limited effectiveness in reducing deaths or illness.\n- Whether people decided to get a health check often depended on how easy it was to access one and whether they knew it was available.\n- Explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nDespite their widespread use, general health checks have been found to have little or no effect on reducing deaths or illness. This raises questions about their value and the factors that influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals, highlighting the need to understand the perspectives and experiences of different stakeholders involved in these checks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify how stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. We also sought to explore the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks, and to understand the values and beliefs associated with them. By examining the qualitative evidence, we hoped to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous review on the effectiveness of general health checks.\n\nMethods\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and grey-literature sources for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks. The search combined terms related to \"health check\", \"screening\", \"preventive assessment\" with qualitative methodology filters. We considered studies conducted in any country, setting, and language.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe screened relevant studies and extracted data on participants, settings, and key themes regarding perceptions of health checks. We then grouped similar findings across studies to identify overarching themes like perceived benefits, barriers, and ways to improve implementation.\n\nHow confident are we in the findings?\nWe rated our confidence in each finding. To do this, we looked at the methods of the original studies and how well their findings matched. We then graded our confidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 relevant studies and chose 36 of them for our analysis. These studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n- People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if reviews show they have little effect on overall death rates.\n- Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n- People felt it was important that health checks were easy to get and that providers were skilled and understood their cultural background.\n- Explaining test results clearly and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, which could affect the reliability of the findings.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

The main issue is the use of technical and academic language that makes key sections difficult to understand. While sentence length is good, the vocabulary is too complex. The summary should be revised to replace jargon with everyday words and simplify academic phrasing to ensure the key messages are accessible to everyone.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While sentence-level metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (P25) and overall readability scores like 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (P25) are excellent, the vocabulary is too complex. This is highlighted by multiple metrics deviating significantly from typical PLS patterns, including 'long_words' (BEYOND_P90), 'complex_words' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (P90), and 'smog_index' (P90). This indicates that while sentences are short, the words used within them are often too long and technical for a plain language summary."
