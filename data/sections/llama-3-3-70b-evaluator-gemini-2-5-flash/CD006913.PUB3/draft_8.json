  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Talking treatments, like therapy and counseling, probably lead to slight improvements in quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety for adults with inflammatory bowel disease. No harmful effects were reported.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if talking treatments and other psychological support (like relaxation techniques) could improve quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms for people with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that tested talking treatments for people with IBD. We then gathered and combined the results from these studies to understand the effects on quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with IBD, including 6111 adults and 294 children and teenagers. Most studies combined different types of support, such as talk therapy and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, a simulated (or 'sham') therapy, or other active treatments. For adults, we found that talking treatments probably slightly improve quality of life and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children and teenagers, talking treatments also appeared to improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence is limited because:\n- The studies were very small.\n- The therapies and people involved varied a lot.\n- People often knew which treatment they were getting, which could affect results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and easy to read, but it needs a few content revisions before it can be approved. The main issue is that a key finding about the treatment's effect on disease symptoms is missing from the results. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Include the key finding about disease activity.**\n   - **Problem:** The 'What did we find?' section does not mention the review's finding on disease activity (physical symptoms), even though this was a key question. This leaves readers with an incomplete picture of the results.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a sentence to the end of the 'What did we find?' paragraph. For example: \"However, we found that these psychological treatments may have little to no effect on the physical symptoms of the disease.\"\n\n2. **Explain the term 'sham therapy' for clarity.**\n   - **Problem:** In the 'What did we find?' section, the phrase \"a simulated (or 'sham') therapy\" may be unclear to a lay audience who may not know what a 'sham' treatment is in a research context.\n   - **Suggestion:** Briefly explain the term in parentheses. For example, change it to: \"...compared these interventions to no therapy, a pretend therapy (called a 'sham' therapy), or other active treatments.\"\n\n3. **Make the final key message more specific and helpful.**\n   - **Problem:** The final key message, \"Further research is needed...\", is very general. The original source material provides more specific details on what kind of research is needed, which is more useful for the reader.\n   - **Suggestion:** Revise the final bullet point to be more informative. For example: \"More research is needed to know the long-term effects of these treatments and to compare different types of therapy. This will help doctors and patients make better decisions about treatment.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All metrics fall within acceptable ranges, with 61% in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and use of active voice. The style and structure are excellent. The required revisions are focused on content completeness and clarity, not linguistic style."
