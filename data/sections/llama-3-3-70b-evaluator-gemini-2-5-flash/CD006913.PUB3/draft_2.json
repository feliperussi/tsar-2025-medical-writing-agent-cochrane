  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling, may slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety in people with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease. Most studies used multimodular approaches, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments. Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression, and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, heterogeneity in populations and delivery methods, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it cannot be approved because it fails two critical checks: it contains a factual error and is missing a required section.\n\nHere are the most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the number of participants.** The draft misstates the total number of people included in the studies.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n   - **Reason:** This is factually incorrect. The source abstract states there were 6111 adults and 294 children/adolescents, which totals 6405 participants.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found 68 studies that involved a \"total of 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents).\"\n\n2. **Add a brief 'Methods' section.** The summary jumps from the aims to the results, leaving the reader to wonder how you reached your conclusions.\n   - **Problem:** A required section explaining how the review was conducted is missing.\n   - **Reason:** Readers need to understand, in simple terms, how the evidence was gathered and evaluated.\n   - **Suggested addition:** Add a new section with a heading like \"How did we conduct this review?\" and include a brief description, for example: \"We searched for studies that tested psychological interventions for people with IBD. We looked for trials that compared these interventions to usual care or no treatment. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to see what effect the interventions had on quality of life, mental health, and disease symptoms.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the strength of the evidence in the key messages.** The current wording is a bit vague and less precise than it could be.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Reason:** This phrase is ambiguous. The original review rated the evidence as 'moderate-certainty', which is a more specific and confident assessment than the draft implies.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Psychological interventions, like therapy and counseling, likely lead to small improvements in quality of life, depression, and anxiety for adults with IBD. We have moderate confidence in this finding.\"\n\nThe evaluation shows the draft generally conforms to the structural patterns of a typical PLS, with most metrics like sentence length (18.45 words, P25) and passive voice (4 instances, P25) falling within the best quartile. However, it deviates on key readability scores. The Flesch Reading Ease score of 31.06 is in the P10 range, and the Coleman‑Liau Index of 14.37 is in the P90 range, both indicating the text is more difficult for a lay audience to read than is typical for a PLS. This supports the need to simplify sentence structure and vocabulary as suggested in the feedback.",
