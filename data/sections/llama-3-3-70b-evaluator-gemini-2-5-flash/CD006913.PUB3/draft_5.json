  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Talking treatments, like therapy and counseling, may help people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found these treatments may slightly improve quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety. However, we are not certain about these benefits. No harmful effects were reported.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease, including studies that look at the long-term effects of these interventions and compare different types of therapy, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best course of treatment.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that tested talking treatments for people with IBD. We then gathered and combined the results from these studies to understand the effects on quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease. Most studies combined different types of support, such as talk therapy and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments. For adults, we found that psychological support probably leads to small improvements in their quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety. For children and teenagers, talk therapy also appeared to improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, differences in the people included and the ways the therapies were provided, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, a few key improvements would make the findings easier for readers to understand and trust. I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' to ensure these refinements are made before publication. My top three recommendations focus on using more consistent language for the main findings, clarifying who participated in the research, and making the results section more direct.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Strengthen and Standardize Your Key Message on Certainty**\n\nThe summary uses different words to describe the certainty of the evidence, which could confuse readers. The key message says you are \"not certain,\" but the results section says the improvements are \"probable.\" \"Probable\" is a better reflection of the \"moderate-certainty evidence\" from the original review.\n\n- **Problematic Sentences:**\n  - Key Message: \"We found these treatments may slightly improve quality of life... However, we are not certain about these benefits.\"\n  - Results: \"...we found that psychological support probably leads to small improvements...\"\n- **Suggestion:** Use the stronger, more consistent term \"probably\" in your key message to accurately reflect the moderate certainty of the evidence. This builds more trust than the vague phrase \"not certain.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite (for Key Message):**\n  \"Talking treatments (like therapy and counseling) for adults with IBD probably lead to slight improvements in quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety. No harmful effects were reported.\"\n\n**2. Clarify Who Participated in the Studies**\n\nThe results are reported separately for adults and children, but the summary first introduces the participants as one large group. This misses an opportunity to show readers that most of the evidence is about adults.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"We found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Break down the total number of participants by adults and children/teenagers right away. This gives important context for why the findings for children are less certain.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n  \"We found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with IBD, including 6111 adults and 294 children and teenagers.\"\n\n**3. Use More Direct, Action-Oriented Language in the Results**\n\nSome sentences are a bit wordy and rely on nouns instead of verbs to describe the findings. This can make them harder to read quickly.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"...we found that psychological support probably leads to small improvements in their quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase using stronger verbs. This makes the sentence shorter and more dynamic.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n  \"For adults, we found that psychological support probably slightly improves quality of life and reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety.\"\n\nBy making these changes, you will create a clearer and more consistent summary for people with IBD.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has GOOD CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. Most metrics (16 of 18) fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong readability and structure. However, the analysis identified two metrics that deviate from typical patterns: the number of nouns ('nouns': 158) and long words ('long_words': 173) are higher than usual. This supports the editorial feedback to replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs and to prefer shorter, more common words where possible."
