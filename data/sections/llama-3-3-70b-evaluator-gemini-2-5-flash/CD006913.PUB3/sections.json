  "key_messages": [
    "Psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling (talking treatments that help people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings), may slightly improve quality of life, depression (a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest), and anxiety (a feeling of worry or fear) in people with inflammatory bowel disease (a condition where the bowel, or intestines, become inflamed), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Patient education (teaching people about their condition and how to manage it) and relaxation techniques (methods to help reduce stress and anxiety, such as deep breathing or meditation) may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.",
    "Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease, including studies that look at the long-term effects of these interventions and compare different types of therapy, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best course of treatment."

      "subheading": "What is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world and most of them lasted for at least two months. Most studies used multimodular approaches, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments. The population characteristics included adults and children with IBD, with the majority of studies focusing on adults. The studies were conducted in different settings, but the specific countries where they took place were not specified. The total number of people who took part in the studies was 6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents. The funding sources for the studies were not explicitly stated in the abstract. Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, heterogeneity in populations and delivery methods, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.",
