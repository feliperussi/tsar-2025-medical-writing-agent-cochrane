  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Talking treatments, like therapy and counseling, probably lead to slight improvements in quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety for adults with inflammatory bowel disease. No harmful effects were reported.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that tested talking treatments for people with IBD. We then gathered and combined the results from these studies to understand the effects on quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with IBD, including 6111 adults and 294 children and teenagers. Most studies combined different types of support, such as talk therapy and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments. For adults, we found that psychological support probably slightly improves quality of life and reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children and teenagers, talk therapy also appeared to improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, differences in the people included and the ways the therapies were provided, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

It just needs a few minor tweaks to remove some technical jargon and make it even more accessible for a general audience. Addressing the following 3 points will make it ready for approval.\n\n1. **Explain the term 'sham'**: The word 'sham' is technical jargon that most readers won't understand.\n    - **Original sentence**: \"Most studies... compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite**: \"Most studies... compared these treatments to no therapy, a simulated (or 'sham') therapy, or other active treatments.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the concept of 'bias'**: The phrase 'introducing potential bias' is abstract. It's better to explain what that means in practical terms.\n    - **Original sentence**: \"...the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite**: \"...participants likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the 'Aims' section**: The first sentence in this section is a bit long and uses several technical terms at once.\n    - **Original sentence**: \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite**: \"We wanted to find out if talking treatments and other psychological support (like relaxation techniques) could improve quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms for people with IBD.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical statistical ranges for a PLS, with over 60% of features in the best quartile. Metrics for sentence length (words_per_sentence, P25) and passive voice use (P25) are particularly strong. Vocabulary complexity metrics (e.g., dale_chall_readability, complex_words) are in the P75 range, indicating the text is slightly more complex than average for a PLS but still within acceptable limits. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify a few specific technical terms to further improve readability."
