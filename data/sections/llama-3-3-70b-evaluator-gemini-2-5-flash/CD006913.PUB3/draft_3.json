  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling, likely lead to small improvements in quality of life, depression, and anxiety for adults with IBD. We have moderate confidence in this finding.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested psychological interventions for people with IBD. We looked for trials that compared these interventions to usual care or no treatment. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to see what effect the interventions had on quality of life, mental health, and disease symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved a total of 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). Most studies used multimodular approaches, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments. Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression, and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, heterogeneity in populations and delivery methods, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

Adding them back would greatly improve clarity right from the start.\n- **Instead of:** \"We found that psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling, likely lead to small improvements in quality of life, depression, and anxiety for adults with IBD.\"\n- **Try this, using the source text:** \"Psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling (talking treatments that help people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings), may slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety in people with inflammatory bowel disease...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is within the word count limit and conforms to many typical PLS patterns, with good sentence length (P25) and use of active voice. However, several readability scores, such as Flesch Reading Ease (P25) and the SMOG Index (P75), indicate the text is more difficult to read than is ideal. This is supported by the use of undefined technical terms like 'multimodular' and 'heterogeneity' and the inclusion of dense sentences copied directly from the technical abstract. Simplifying this language will improve clarity for a lay audience."
