  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling (talking treatments that help people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings), may slightly improve quality of life, depression (a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest), and anxiety (a feeling of worry or fear) in people with inflammatory bowel disease (a condition where the bowel, or intestines, become inflamed), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Patient education (teaching people about their condition and how to manage it) and relaxation techniques (methods to help reduce stress and anxiety, such as deep breathing or meditation) may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease, including studies that look at the long-term effects of these interventions and compare different types of therapy, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best course of treatment.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating psychological interventions for inflammatory bowel disease across multiple databases. We extracted results on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity, summarizing the findings across studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease. Most studies combined different types of support, such as talk therapy and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, sham, or other active treatments. For adults, we found that psychological support probably leads to small improvements in their quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety. For children and teenagers, talk therapy also appeared to improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, differences in the people included and the ways the therapies were provided, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

There is a factual error in the number of participants, and the summary's readability is significantly impaired by extremely long and complex sentences, particularly in the 'Key messages' section. These issues make the text difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Factual Error:** The number of participants is incorrect.\n   - **Current Text:** \"We found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n   - **Problem:** The original abstract and source data state there were 6111 adults and 294 children/adolescents, for a total of 6405 participants.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\n2. **Shorten Overly Long Sentences:** The first key message is a single 81-word sentence packed with multiple definitions, making it very hard to follow.\n   - **Current Text:** \"Psychological interventions, including therapy and counseling (talking treatments that help people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings), may slightly improve quality of life, depression (a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest), and anxiety (a feeling of worry or fear) in people with inflammatory bowel disease (a condition where the bowel, or intestines, become inflamed), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence structure overwhelms the reader. Key findings are lost among the definitions.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Talking treatments, like therapy and counseling, may help people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found these treatments may slightly improve quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety. However, we are not certain about these benefits. No harmful effects were reported.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the Methods Description:** The language used to describe the review process is vague and uses jargon.\n   - **Current Text:** \"We performed a systematic search for studies evaluating psychological interventions for inflammatory bowel disease across multiple databases. We extracted results on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity, summarizing the findings across studies.\"\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like 'systematic search' and 'evaluating psychological interventions' are not plain language and don't clearly explain what was done.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched major medical research databases for studies that tested talking treatments for people with IBD. We then gathered and combined the results from these studies to understand the effects on quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns. 15 of the 18 metrics, including all 9 readability indices, fall into the P90/P10 ranges, indicating the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS. The most critical issue identified by the metrics is the average sentence length ('words_per_sentence'), which at 25.4 words is in the highest decile (P90) and is the primary driver of the poor readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 15.2). The high counts of complex and long words also contribute to the difficulty."
