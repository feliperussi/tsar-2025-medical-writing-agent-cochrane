  "draft": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Talking treatments, like therapy and counseling, probably lead to slight improvements in quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety for adults with inflammatory bowel disease. No harmful effects were reported.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if talking treatments and other psychological support (like relaxation techniques) could improve quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms for people with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that tested talking treatments for people with IBD. We then gathered and combined the results from these studies to understand the effects on quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with IBD, including 6111 adults and 294 children and teenagers. Most studies combined different types of support, such as talk therapy and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to no therapy, a simulated (or 'sham') therapy, or other active treatments. For adults, we found that psychological support probably slightly improves quality of life and reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children and teenagers, talk therapy also appeared to improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, differences in the people included and the ways the therapies were provided, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-written summary that meets all critical requirements for accuracy, completeness, and length. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend three small improvements. \n\n1. Simplify the 'Limitations' section: The final sentence is quite long and complex. Instead of 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, differences in the people included and the ways the therapies were provided, and the likelihood that participants were aware of their assigned treatment, which could have influenced the results,' consider breaking this into a simple list, like: 'Our confidence is limited because: \n- The studies were very small. \n- The therapies and people involved varied a lot. \n- People often knew which treatment they were getting, which could affect results.' This is easier to scan and understand. \n\n2. Use consistent terms for therapies: The summary uses 'Talking treatments,' 'psychological support,' and 'talk therapy.' Sticking to one clear term, like 'talking treatments,' throughout the text will help avoid confusion. For example, in the 'What did we find?' section, you could say: 'we found that talking treatments probably slightly improves quality of life...' \n\n3. Make a key message more specific: The phrase 'the evidence is limited' is a bit vague. You could strengthen it by adding the reason, for example: '...the evidence is limited due to small studies, especially for children and adolescents.' \n\nThese changes will help ensure the summary is as accessible as possible for all readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the expected median or best-quartile ranges, which is an excellent result. The feedback provided focuses on minor refinements to further improve clarity, rather than addressing any significant metric deviations."
