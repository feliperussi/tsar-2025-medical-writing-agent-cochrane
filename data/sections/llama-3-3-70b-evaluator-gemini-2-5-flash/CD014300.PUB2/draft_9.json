  "draft": "Do psychological and social support programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether psychological and social support programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. While no harmful effects were reported, this lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- These programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these programs have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can develop after someone goes through a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life. Most programs were run by 'paraprofessionals'. These are trained local people who are not mental health professionals but can provide initial support.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if psychosocial interventions improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial interventions to situations where people received no program, their usual care, or were on a waiting list. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. The mean study duration was 18 weeks, with a range of 10 to 32 weeks. Psychological and social interventions may improve mental well-being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on functioning and prosocial behavior in adults, and the results are very uncertain for children and adolescents.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. All critical checks have passed. However, a few improvements can make it even more accessible for readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Use consistent, simple terminology for the intervention.** The summary uses several different terms ('psychological and social support programs', 'mental health programs', 'psychosocial interventions'). This could confuse readers. It's best to pick the simplest term and use it consistently.\n   - **Problem:** The title uses \"psychological and social support programs,\" but a later heading asks, \"What are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace \"psychosocial interventions\" with the simpler term used in the title throughout the text. For example, change the heading to: \"What are psychological and social support programs and how can they help?\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences contain technical terms and abstract nouns that can be difficult to follow, even if the overall readability score is good.\n   - **Problem:** \"In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this using more direct, everyday language. For example: \"In these crises, support programs may be especially helpful. They aim to improve a person's sense of wellbeing, their ability to cope with stress, and how well they manage daily activities.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the main findings in the 'What did we find?' section.** The current paragraph combines results for adults and children in long sentences, which can be hard to unpack.\n   - **Problem:** \"Psychological and social interventions may improve mental well-being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on functioning and prosocial behavior in adults, and the results are very uncertain for children and adolescents.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Break this information into shorter, distinct points to make the key findings clearer. For example:\n     - For adults, these programs may slightly improve wellbeing.\n     - For children and adolescents, it is unclear if the programs have any effect.\n     - We don't have enough evidence to know how these programs affect people's daily functioning or social behavior.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, it deviates from typical patterns on three vocabulary-related metrics: noun count (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This analysis supports the editorial feedback, indicating that while sentence structure is strong, the word choice could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
