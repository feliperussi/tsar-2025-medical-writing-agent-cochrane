  "draft": "# Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. No harmful effects were reported, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n- Psychosocial interventions may have a slight positive effect on mental wellbeing in adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding. It is also unclear whether these interventions have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of mental health promotion in humanitarian settings, including the need for more studies with longer-term follow-up and the importance of considering the specific needs and contexts of different populations.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on promoting mental health in people living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior in adults and children. The authors also sought to evaluate the acceptability of these interventions and identify any potential benefits or harms.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing psychosocial interventions to control conditions, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects on mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. The mean study duration was 18 weeks, with a range of 10 to 32 weeks. Most of the studies were funded by grants from academic institutions or non-governmental organisations. The studies included both children and adults, with nine studies focusing on children and adolescents, and four studies focusing on adults. The interventions were delivered by paraprofessionals, who are individuals not qualified as mental or behavioural health service professionals but work at the first stage of contact with people seeking mental health care. The interventions were compared to control conditions, such as no intervention, intervention as usual, or waiting list. Psychological and social interventions may improve mental well-being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on functioning and prosocial behaviour in adults, and the results are very uncertain for children and adolescents.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

However, it requires revision to fully align with Cochrane Plain Language Summary guidelines, the subheading formatting and simplifying language for better readability. The subheadings for 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement of the style guide. Additionally, several sentences are long and dense, making them difficult to follow, and the text is somewhat noun-heavy with complex vocabulary, as supported by the linguistic metrics. The 'Results' section would also benefit from a paragraph break to improve visual flow.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of features in the best quartile and 27.8% in the median range. However, five features deviate significantly from typical patterns. The `smog_index` (15.00), `complex_words_dc` (295.00), and `long_words` (221.00) are all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating higher readability difficulty due to complex and long vocabulary. The `nouns` count (202.00) and `complex_words` (139.00) are also in the 90th percentile range, suggesting a noun‑heavy style and frequent use of multi‑syllable words. These deviations suggest that the text could benefit from simplification of vocabulary and sentence structure to enhance readability."
