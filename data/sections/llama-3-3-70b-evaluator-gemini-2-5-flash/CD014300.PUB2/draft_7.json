  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. The studies reported no harmful effects, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- These programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these programs have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are mental health programs and how can they help?\nMental health programs are activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These programs can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, mental health programs can help support people's wellbeing by improving how they function in their daily lives, their ability to cope with stress, and their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if mental health programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared mental health programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. Trained local helpers ran most of the programs, which lasted about 18 weeks. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. For adults, mental health programs may slightly improve mental wellbeing. However, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. For adults, the studies did not measure the effect on daily functioning or social behavior. For children and adolescents, there was not enough evidence to know if the programs improved these areas.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

The following suggestions are aimed at making an already good summary even more accessible for readers by addressing a few minor clarity issues.\n\n**1. Simplify noun-heavy sentences in the 'What did we find?' section.** ...\nSome sentences are a bit dense, which can make them harder to read. This observation is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of nouns compared to typical summaries.\n- **Original text:** \"For adults, the studies did not measure the effect on daily functioning or social behavior. For children and adolescents, there was not enough evidence to know if the programs improved these areas.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrasing is slightly repetitive and less direct than it could be.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies did not measure daily functioning or social behavior in adults. For children and adolescents, the evidence on these outcomes was very uncertain.\"\n\n**2. Make the main key message more direct.**\nThe second sentence of the first key message is a bit convoluted and restates the uncertainty already mentioned.\n- **Original text:** \"The studies reported no harmful effects, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly wordy and less impactful.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"While no harmful effects were reported, this lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the benefits.\"\n\n**3. Streamline the explanation of PTSD.**\nThe current explanation is split across two sentences, which slightly interrupts the flow for the reader.\n- **Original text:** \"...post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This can be easily combined into a single, more fluid sentence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can develop after someone goes through a traumatic event.\"\n\nThese small changes will help improve the flow and directness of the summary for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores and sentence structure are excellent. However, the analysis indicates a high number of nouns (P90) and Dale-Chall complex words (P90), suggesting some sentences may be dense or use less common vocabulary, which could be simplified for better clarity."
