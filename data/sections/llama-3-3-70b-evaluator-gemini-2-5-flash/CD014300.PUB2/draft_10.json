  "draft": "Do psychological and social support programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether psychological and social support programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. While no harmful effects were reported, this lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- These programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these programs have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can develop after someone goes through a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are psychological and social support programs and how can they help?\nPsychological and social support programs are designed to promote mental health and well-being. These programs can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, these programs may be especially helpful. They aim to improve a person's sense of wellbeing, their ability to cope with stress, and how well they manage daily activities. Most programs were run by 'paraprofessionals'. These are trained local people who are not mental health professionals but can provide initial support.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if psychological and social support programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological and social support programs to situations where people received no program, their usual care, or were on a waiting list. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. The mean study duration was 18 weeks, with a range of 10 to 32 weeks. \n- For adults, these programs may slightly improve wellbeing.\n- For children and adolescents, it is unclear if the programs have any effect.\n- We don't have enough evidence to know how these programs affect people's daily functioning or social behavior.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "While this is a strong draft that passes all critical checks, it can be made clearer for readers by addressing a few areas of vocabulary complexity and phrasing. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing higher-than-usual counts for nouns, long words, and complex vocabulary. Here are the top 4 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify technical or formal phrasing.** Some phrases, while accurate, can be simplified for a lay audience.\n   - **Quote:** '...people living in humanitarian settings are at risk...'\n   - **Problem:** 'Humanitarian settings' is jargon. A simpler description would be more direct.\n   - **Suggestion:** '...people living in these crisis situations are at risk...'\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of noun phrases where possible.** This makes sentences more direct and easier to read. The analysis shows a high number of nouns, and changing some to verbs will help.\n   - **Quote:** 'The mean study duration was 18 weeks...'\n   - **Problem:** 'Mean study duration' is a technical, noun-heavy phrase.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'The studies lasted 18 weeks on average...'\n\n3. **Clarify the definition of 'paraprofessionals'.** The current definition focuses on what they are not. A more positive and direct definition would be clearer.\n   - **Quote:** 'These are trained local people who are not mental health professionals but can provide initial support.'\n   - **Problem:** The phrasing is slightly negative and wordy.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'These are trained people from the local community who provide first-line mental health support.'\n\n4. **Break up long, complex sentences.** The sentence defining PTSD is a good example where splitting it would improve readability.\n   - **Quote:** 'As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can develop after someone goes through a traumatic event.'\n   - **Problem:** This sentence combines a list of conditions with a definition, making it long and complex.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'As a result, people in these situations are at risk of mental health problems like anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a condition that can develop after a traumatic event.'\n\nBy making these small changes, the summary will be even more accessible to its intended audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and active voice usage are excellent. However, the analysis identified three metrics in the P90 range, indicating a deviation from typical patterns: noun count (161.0), Dale-Chall complex words (236.0), and long words (171.0). This suggests that while the sentence structure is clear, the vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which supports the editorial recommendation to simplify specific terms and phrases."
