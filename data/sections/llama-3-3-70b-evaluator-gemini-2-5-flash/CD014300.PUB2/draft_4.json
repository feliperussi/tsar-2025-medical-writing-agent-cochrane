  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. The studies reported no harmful effects, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- Psychosocial interventions (programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being) may have a slight positive effect on mental wellbeing in adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these interventions have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on promoting mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior in adults and children. The authors also sought to evaluate the acceptability of these interventions and identify any potential benefits or harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. Researchers conducted the studies in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\n\nFor adults, these programs may slightly improve mental well-being. However, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. It is also unclear if these programs helped improve people's daily functioning or social behavior.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of dense, technical language in a few key places and a lack of clarity when summarizing the results for different groups.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the long list of outcomes.** The list of what the review measured is dense with abstract terms that can be hard for readers to grasp all at once.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior in adults and children.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to know if these programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the results for adults versus children.** The current summary of the findings on 'functioning' and 'social behavior' is too general and combines the results for adults and children, when the evidence was actually different.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It is also unclear if these programs helped improve people's daily functioning or social behavior.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For adults, the studies did not measure the effect on daily functioning or social behavior. For children and adolescents, there was not enough evidence to know if the programs improved these areas.\"\n\n3. **Remove the redundant definition in the key messages.** The term 'psychosocial interventions' is defined in the key messages and then again in its own section. This repetition makes the key messages less concise.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** In the key messages: \"- Psychosocial interventions (programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being) may have a slight positive effect...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Remove the definition from the key messages and just use the simpler term. For example: \"- Mental health and wellbeing programs may have a slight positive effect on adults...\" Then, keep the full definition in the later section, \"What are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft conforms well in many areas, particularly with its excellent sentence length (P25) and use of active voice (P75). However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The SMOG index (P90), count of Dale-Chall complex words (P90), number of long words (P90), and high noun count (P90) all support the editorial feedback. These metrics indicate that the language is denser and more abstract than is typical for a PLS, which could create barriers for some readers."
