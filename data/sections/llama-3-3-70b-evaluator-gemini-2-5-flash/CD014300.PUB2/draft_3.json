  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. No harmful effects were reported, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- Psychosocial interventions (programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being) may have a slight positive effect on mental wellbeing in adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these interventions have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of mental health promotion in humanitarian settings, including the need for more studies with longer-term follow-up and the importance of considering the specific needs and contexts of different populations.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on promoting mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior in adults and children. The authors also sought to evaluate the acceptability of these interventions and identify any potential benefits or harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing psychosocial interventions to control conditions, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects on mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. \nThe studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. \nMost programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\n\nFor adults, these programs may slightly improve mental well-being. \nHowever, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. \nIt is also unclear if these programs helped improve people's daily functioning or social behavior.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too complex and academic, and several long sentences make key points difficult to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex sentences, especially in the key messages.** Your key messages should be the easiest part of the summary to read, but one sentence is very long and uses abstract language.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of mental health promotion in humanitarian settings, including the need for more studies with longer-term follow-up and the importance of considering the specific needs and contexts of different populations.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 42 words, this sentence is too long and filled with abstract nouns ('gaps', 'understanding', 'contexts') that are hard for readers to process quickly.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\"\n\n2. **Use active voice to make the text more direct and engaging.** Several sentences use the passive voice, which can make the text feel distant and less clear about who is performing the action.\n   - **Problematic sentences:** \"No harmful effects were reported...\" and \"The studies were conducted in several countries...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The active voice is more direct and easier to read. It clarifies who is doing what (e.g., the study authors, the researchers).\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies reported no harmful effects...\" and \"Researchers conducted the studies in several countries...\"\n\n3. **Break up long sentences in the main body.** The methods section contains a very long sentence that tries to summarize the entire review process at once.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We searched for studies comparing psychosocial interventions to control conditions, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects on mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This 39-word sentence is dense and repeats information from the title, making it hard to follow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared psychosocial programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your own evaluation results support these suggestions. The draft has high scores for complex words (P90), long words (P90), and the SMOG index (P90), confirming that the vocabulary is too difficult. The number of passive voice constructions is also higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with many features falling in the best quartile or median range. However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words'—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses far more complex, long, and noun-based words than is typical for a PLS. This directly impacts readability and supports the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
