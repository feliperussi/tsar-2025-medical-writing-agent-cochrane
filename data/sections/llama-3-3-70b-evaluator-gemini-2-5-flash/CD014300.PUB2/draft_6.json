  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. The studies reported no harmful effects, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- These programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these programs have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are support programs and how can they help?\nSupport programs are activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These programs can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, these programs can help support people's wellbeing by improving how they function in their daily lives, their ability to cope with stress, and their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if these programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared support programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. Researchers conducted the studies in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\n\nFor adults, these programs may slightly improve mental wellbeing. However, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. For adults, the studies did not measure the effect on daily functioning or social behavior. For children and adolescents, there was not enough evidence to know if the programs improved these areas.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' based on a few key improvements that will make the summary even easier for readers to understand. My main suggestion is to use consistent terminology throughout the document.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Use one consistent term for the programs being studied.** The summary uses 'mental health programs' in the title and key messages, but then switches to 'support programs' in the main text. This could confuse readers. I recommend choosing one term and using it consistently after defining it.\n    *   **Quote:** (Title) \"Do **mental health programs** improve wellbeing...\" vs. (Body) \"What are **support programs** and how can they help?\"\n    *   **Problem:** Readers may wonder if 'mental health programs' and 'support programs' are the same thing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace 'support programs' with 'mental health programs' throughout the text to match the title. For example: \"What are mental health programs and how can they help?\" and \"We searched for studies that compared mental health programs to no program.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the definition of PTSD to improve flow.** The current definition is tacked on to the end of a long sentence, which makes it a bit clunky.\n    *   **Quote:** \"...at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is long and the definition feels like an afterthought.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into two shorter, clearer sentences. For example: \"As a result, people in these settings are at risk of mental health problems like anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a condition that can develop after a traumatic event.\"\n\n3.  **Make phrasing more direct by using active voice.** While the use of passive voice is low overall, a few sentences can be made more direct.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Most programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\"\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase 'were run by' is passive. Using the active voice makes the sentence more engaging.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite the sentence to put the 'doer' first. For example: \"Trained local helpers ran most of the programs, which lasted about 18 weeks.\"\n\nAddressing these points, especially the first one, will ensure the summary is as clear and helpful as possible for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 10.06) are excellent. The single notable deviation is the 'complex_words_dc' metric (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), which is higher than typical (P90). This reflects the necessary use of terms like 'humanitarian' and 'psychosocial'. My feedback to clearly define and consistently use key terms will help mitigate the impact of this higher complexity."
