  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. While no harmful effects were reported, this lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the benefits.\n\n- These programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these programs have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that can develop after someone goes through a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are mental health programs and how can they help?\nMental health programs are activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These programs can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, mental health programs can help support people's wellbeing by improving how they function in their daily lives, their ability to cope with stress, and their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if mental health programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared mental health programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. Trained local helpers ran most of the programs, which lasted about 18 weeks. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. The studies did not measure daily functioning or social behavior in adults. For children and adolescents, the evidence on these outcomes was very uncertain. Psychological and social interventions may improve mental well-being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-structured draft that is easy to read. However, a few key changes are needed to improve its accuracy and precision before it can be approved. My top 3 recommendations focus on using more precise terminology and ensuring the findings are completely and accurately reported.\n\n1. **Use more precise terminology for the interventions and providers.**\n   - **The issue:** The draft uses the general term \"mental health programs,\" but the review specifically studied \"psychosocial interventions\" (like counseling and support groups), which is a narrower category. Similarly, \"trained local helpers\" is used instead of the more specific term \"paraprofessionals.\"\n   - **Why it matters:** Using the correct terms ensures readers understand exactly what was—and was not—studied. This avoids confusion with other types of mental health care, like medication.\n   - **Suggestion:** Change the title to \"Do psychological and social support programs improve wellbeing...?\" and use \"support programs\" or \"psychosocial interventions\" throughout. For the providers, clarify who they are: \"Most programs were run by 'paraprofessionals'. These are trained local people who are not mental health professionals but can provide initial support.\"\n\n2. **Ensure the key message about uncertainty is balanced.**\n   - **The issue:** In the key messages, the draft states: \"...this lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the benefits.\"\n   - **Why it matters:** The source material correctly notes that we are uncertain about both benefits *and harms*. A core principle of plain language summaries is to present a balanced view of the evidence.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please amend the sentence to include harms: \"...this lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\"\n\n3. **Add important detail to the methods description.**\n   - **The issue:** The methods section says, \"We searched for studies that compare mental health programs to no program.\"\n   - **Why it matters:** This is an oversimplification. The review's comparison groups also included \"intervention as usual\" and \"waiting list,\" which are different from having no program at all.\n   - **Suggestion:** For greater accuracy, please clarify the comparison groups. A good rewrite would be: \"We searched for studies that compared these support programs to situations where people received no program, their usual care, or were on a waiting list.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 14 of 18 metrics (77.8%) are in the best quartile for readability, indicating excellent sentence structure, active voice, and simple vocabulary. However, the metric for Dale-Chall complex words ('complex_words_dc') is higher than typical (P90 range). This is likely due to necessary technical terms central to the review's topic (e.g., 'humanitarian', 'psychosocial') and is acceptable for accuracy."
