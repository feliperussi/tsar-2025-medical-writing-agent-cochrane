  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. No harmful effects were reported, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n- Psychosocial interventions may have a slight positive effect on mental wellbeing in adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding. \n- It is also unclear whether these interventions have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of mental health promotion in humanitarian settings, including the need for more studies with longer-term follow-up and the importance of considering the specific needs and contexts of different populations.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on promoting mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior in adults and children. The authors also sought to evaluate the acceptability of these interventions and identify any potential benefits or harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing psychosocial interventions to control conditions, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects on mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. The mean study duration was 18 weeks, with a range of 10 to 32 weeks. Most of the studies were funded by grants from academic institutions or non-governmental organisations. The studies included both children and adults, with nine studies focusing on children and adolescents, and four studies focusing on adults. The interventions were delivered by paraprofessionals, who are individuals not qualified as mental or behavioural health service professionals but work at the first stage of contact with people seeking mental health care. The interventions were compared to control conditions, such as no intervention, intervention as usual, or waiting list. Psychological and social interventions may improve mental well-being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on functioning and prosocial behaviour in adults, and the results are very uncertain for children and adolescents.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This summary is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are overly complex vocabulary and long, dense sentences that make key findings difficult to understand. The 'What did we find?' section in particular is a long wall of text that mixes study details with results, which should be separated for readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex language and define technical terms.** The text uses vocabulary that is too advanced for a general audience. This is supported by several metrics showing high complexity (SMOG Index, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words are all beyond the 90th percentile for PLS texts).\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The interventions were delivered by paraprofessionals, who are individuals not qualified as mental or behavioural health service professionals but work at the first stage of contact with people seeking mental health care.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This 37-word sentence is dense and uses technical phrasing. While it defines 'paraprofessionals', the definition itself is complex.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The programs were run by trained local helpers, known as paraprofessionals. These are people from the community trained to provide basic mental health support, but they are not doctors or therapists.\"\n\n2. **Break up long paragraphs to make results easier to digest.** The main results section is a single, 146-word paragraph that combines study characteristics with the actual findings, making it hard for readers to extract the most important information.\n   - **Problematic section:** The entire paragraph under \"What did we find?\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This 'wall of text' mixes details about study locations, duration, and funding with the critical results about adults and children, burying the main message.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Split this into two smaller, focused paragraphs:\n     - (Paragraph 1 - Study Details): \"We found 13 studies that included 7917 people. The studies took place in nine countries, including Lebanon, India, and Tanzania. Most programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\"\n     - (Paragraph 2 - Key Findings): \"For adults, these programs may slightly improve mental well-being. However, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. It is also unclear if these programs helped improve people's daily functioning or social behavior.\"\n\n3. **Shorten long, wordy sentences.** Several sentences are over 30 words long and use abstract, noun-heavy language, which can be difficult for readers to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of mental health promotion in humanitarian settings, including the need for more studies with longer-term follow-up and the importance of considering the specific needs and contexts of different populations.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This 43-word sentence is complex and uses phrases like 'addressing the significant gaps in our understanding' and 'contexts of different populations'.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"More research is needed to understand how to best support mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity that require attention. Five key metrics—nouns, complex words, long words, Dale-Chall complex words, and the SMOG index—are in the 90th percentile or beyond. This indicates that the text's vocabulary is substantially more complex and difficult than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which directly impacts readability and reader understanding."
