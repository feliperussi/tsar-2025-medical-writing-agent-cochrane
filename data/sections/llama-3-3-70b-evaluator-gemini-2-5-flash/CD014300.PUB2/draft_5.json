  "draft": "Do mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether mental health programs improve wellbeing for people in low- and middle-income countries affected by war, conflict, or humanitarian crises. The studies reported no harmful effects, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- Mental health and wellbeing programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these interventions have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if these programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. Researchers conducted the studies in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\n\nFor adults, these programs may slightly improve mental well-being. However, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. For adults, the studies did not measure the effect on daily functioning or social behavior. For children and adolescents, there was not enough evidence to know if the programs improved these areas.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. However, it is not approved because of a few key areas where complex, technical language could be simplified for a lay audience. Addressing the following 3 points will significantly improve readability.\n\n1. **Replace unexplained technical terms.** The term 'psychosocial functioning' is used without a clear, simple explanation, which could confuse readers.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\"\n   - **Problem:** 'Psychosocial functioning' is jargon. Readers won't know if this means their ability to work, socialize, or something else.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...these programs may be helpful in supporting people's wellbeing. This includes improving how they function in their daily lives, their ability to cope with stress, and their quality of life.\"\n\n2. **Simplify wordy sentences.** Some sentences are long and contain repetitive phrases that can be made more direct.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"In the context of humanitarian crises, psychosocial interventions may be particularly helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\"\n   - **Problem:** This 32-word sentence is complex. Phrases like 'in the context of' and 'promoting positive aspects of mental health' are wordy.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In these crises, such programs can help support people's wellbeing by improving how they function day-to-day, their ability to cope, and their quality of life.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent, simple terms for interventions.** The summary uses 'mental health programs', 'psychosocial interventions', and 'these interventions' interchangeably. Sticking to one simple term after the initial definition improves clarity.\n   - **Problem:** Switching between different terms for the same concept can make the text feel inconsistent and harder to follow.\n   - **Suggestion:** After defining 'psychosocial interventions' in the background section, consistently use a simpler term like 'these programs' or 'support programs' throughout the rest of the summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Sentence length (17.9 words) and active voice use are excellent. However, the analysis identified a key area for improvement: vocabulary complexity. The number of Dale-Chall complex words (225) and long words (166) are both in the 90th percentile range, deviating significantly from typical PLS texts. This supports the editorial feedback to replace jargon and simplify wordy phrasing to improve readability for a lay audience."
