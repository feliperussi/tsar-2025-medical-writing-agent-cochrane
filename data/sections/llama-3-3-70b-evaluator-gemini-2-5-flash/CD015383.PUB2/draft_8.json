  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nWe found that psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain about this. We need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy? \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that combines psychedelic substances - like psilocybin (magic mushrooms) or LSD - with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair). These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWhat did we do? \nTo answer our question, we collected and analyzed the results from all relevant studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. We included 6 studies of a type called randomized controlled trials.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. Researchers conducted the studies, which lasted 6 to 12 months, in clinics in the USA and Switzerland. Organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy funded the studies, with no involvement from drug companies.\n\nWe compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD. The other type used MDMA (Ecstasy). Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\n\nThe treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious unwanted effects reported. However, we need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality, and to address the limitations of current studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024. We need more research to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases. Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start. The summary passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. However, it needs some revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of complex vocabulary and some repetitive phrasing that could be more direct and engaging.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex and Wordy Sentences**\n\nSome sentences use academic phrasing that can be simplified. This makes the text easier to read and understand quickly.\n\n- **Quote:** \"We aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\"\n- **Problem:** This sentence is long and uses several multi-syllable words ('determine', 'effective', 'well-tolerated').\n- **Suggestion:** \"We wanted to find out if this therapy reduces symptoms and if it is safe.\"\n\n**2. Clarify the Main Findings**\n\nThe results section repeats the main message from the introduction but misses an opportunity to provide more specific details from the review before giving the overall conclusion.\n\n- **Quote:** \"Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\"\n- **Problem:** This is the third time this general conclusion is stated. The abstract shows a difference between classical psychedelics and MDMA, which is important information for the reader.\n- **Suggestion:** \"Therapy using 'classical' psychedelics (like psilocybin and LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. The effect of therapy using MDMA ('Ecstasy') is very uncertain. Overall, while the therapy may help, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain.\"\n\n**3. Reduce Passive Voice and Jargon**\n\nThe summary uses some passive phrasing and technical terms without explanation, which can make the text feel distant and harder to follow.\n\n- **Quote:** \"We included 6 studies of a type called randomized controlled trials.\"\n- **Problem:** The term 'randomized controlled trials' is unexplained jargon. The phrasing is also slightly passive.\n- **Suggestion:** \"We found 6 studies called randomized controlled trials. This is a type of study where people are put into different treatment groups at random to compare them fairly.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile. The summary has excellent sentence length (16.8 words/sentence) and readability scores on several indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning-Fog). However, four metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns, falling into the P90 range. These are 'passive_voice' (20 instances), 'smog_index' (14.75), 'complex_words' (123), and 'long_words' (190), all of which suggest that the vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback provided aims to address these specific areas."
