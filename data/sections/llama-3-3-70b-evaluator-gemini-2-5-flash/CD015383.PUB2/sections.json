  "key_messages": [
    "Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a type of therapy that uses psychedelic drugs, which are substances that can cause hallucinations, under the guidance of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being) and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.",
    "Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence, in order to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases."

      "subheading": "What is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?",
      "content": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that combines psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress. These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life. Current treatments for these conditions often include medication and therapy, but they may not be effective for everyone. Psychedelic-assisted therapy has been proposed as a potential new approach to treating these conditions."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. They aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated. The authors also wanted to explore the potential benefits and risks of using different types of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin and MDMA, in this context."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants' data being analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to placebo or active comparators. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, reducing statistical power, and participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2024."
