  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases? \n\nWe searched for studies that looked at whether psychedelic-assisted therapy could help people with life-threatening illnesses who have anxiety, depression, or existential distress. We collected and combined the results from the studies to understand the effects of these therapies.\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychedelic-assisted therapy is better than a placebo or other treatments for reducing anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We also looked at its safety and compared the effects of different psychedelic drugs, like psilocybin and MDMA.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, reducing statistical power. Also, it was difficult to 'blind' the studies, meaning participants likely knew if they were receiving the real drug or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This could have influenced the results.\n\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants' data being analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to placebo or active comparators.\n\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While the information is factually accurate and the word count is good, there are critical structural and clarity issues that must be addressed before it can be published.\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add required sections and use question-based subheadings.**\n   - **Problem:** The summary is currently a single block of text. The Cochrane style guide requires using question-based subheadings (e.g., 'What did we find?') to break up the text and guide the reader. Without them, the summary is difficult to navigate.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please restructure the entire summary using question-based subheadings for each section, such as:\n     - What did we want to find out?\n     - What did we find?\n     - What are the limitations of the evidence?\n     - How up-to-date is this evidence?\n\n2. **Add a 'Key Messages' section at the beginning.**\n   - **Problem:** The summary is missing the 'Key Messages' section. This is the most important part of the PLS, as it gives readers the main takeaways immediately.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please add a 'Key Messages' section right after the title. You can adapt the content from the source material, for example:\n     - '- Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety and depression in people with life‑threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.'\n     - '- The treatment appears to be well tolerated, with no serious side effects reported in the studies.'\n     - '- More and larger studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and harms.'\n\n3. **Simplify the explanation of the study limitations.**\n   - **Problem:** The sentence explaining the limitations uses technical jargon ('statistical power') and passive voice, which can be confusing for a lay audience.\n   - **Quote:** 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, reducing statistical power. Also, it was difficult to 'blind' the studies...'\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this for clarity and use a more active voice. For example: 'The evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment), which could have influenced the results.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nThe linguistic analysis shows a high number of passive voice constructions (14 instances, placing it in the 75th percentile), which supports the need to rewrite sentences like the point #3 to be more direct and active.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good conformity with typical PLS patterns on most metrics, with 33.3% of features in the best quartile and 61.1% in the median range. Sentence length and use of nominalizations are strong points. However, one metric, the Coleman-Liau Index, deviates significantly (P90), suggesting some long or complex words are used. Additionally, the passive voice count is on the higher end of the typical range (P75), which aligns with the editorial feedback to improve clarity by using more active constructions."
