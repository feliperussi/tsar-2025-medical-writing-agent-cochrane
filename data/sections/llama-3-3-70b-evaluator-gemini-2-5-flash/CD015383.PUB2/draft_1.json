  "draft": "# Can therapy using psychedelic drugs (substances that can cause hallucinations) help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n**Key Messages**\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a type of therapy that uses psychedelic drugs, which are substances that can cause hallucinations, under the guidance of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being) and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence, in order to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases.\n**Introduction**\n### What is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that combines psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress. These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life. Current treatments for these conditions often include medication and therapy, but they may not be effective for everyone. Psychedelic-assisted therapy has been proposed as a potential new approach to treating these conditions.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. They aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated. The authors also wanted to explore the potential benefits and risks of using different types of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin and MDMA, in this context.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies investigating psychedelic‑assisted therapy targeting anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life‑threatening illnesses.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nRelevant outcomes were extracted, results were summarized, and the overall findings were compiled to assess the therapeutic impact of psychedelics in this population.\n### Confidence Assessment\nThe certainty of the evidence was evaluated using established criteria (e.g., GRADE), considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants' data being analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to placebo or active comparators. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, reducing statistical power, and participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED primarily because the subheadings in the 'Methods' section are not phrased as questions, which is a critical requirement of the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text suffers from excessively long sentences, frequent use of passive voice, and some wordy or formal phrasing, all of which significantly reduce readability for a patient audience.\n\nHere are the top improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Subheading Format (Critical Issue):** The subheadings in the 'Methods' section are not questions.\n    *   **Problematic:**\n        *   `### Search Strategy`\n        *   `### Data Extraction and Synthesis`\n        *   `### Confidence Assessment`\n    *   **Why problematic:** The Master Style Guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to improve readability and engagement for patients.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        *   `### How did we search for studies?`\n        *   `### How did we collect and summarize the data?`\n        *   `### How sure are we about the evidence?`\n\n2.  **Excessive Sentence Length:** Many sentences, particularly in the 'Key Messages', are too long and complex, making them difficult to understand.\n    *   **Problematic:** `Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a type of therapy that uses psychedelic drugs, which are substances that can cause hallucinations, under the guidance of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life‑threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.`\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is 49 words long. While it defines terms, its length makes it a 'wall of text' that is hard for a patient to process in one go.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** `Psychedelic-assisted therapy uses psychedelic drugs (substances that can cause hallucinations) under a therapist's guidance. This therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life‑threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.`\n\n3.  **Excessive Passive Voice:** The 'Methods' and 'Results' sections frequently use passive voice, which obscures who is performing the action and makes the text less direct.\n    *   **Problematic:** `Relevant outcomes were extracted, results were summarized, and the overall findings were compiled to assess the therapeutic impact of psychedelics in this population.` (from 'Methods')\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence uses passive voice three times, violating the Master Style Guide's recommendation to use active voice (e.g., 'We compared the results').\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** `We extracted relevant outcomes, summarized the results, and compiled the overall findings to assess the therapeutic impact of psychedelics in this population.`\n\n4.  **Wordiness and Formal Language:** Some phrases are unnecessarily wordy or use overly formal language that could be simplified.\n    *   **Problematic:** `...with 140 participants' data being analyzed.` (from 'Results')\n    *   **Why problematic:** The phrase 'being analyzed' is clunky and passive. It can be made more direct and active.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** `...and we analyzed data from 140 of them.`\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis strongly supports these observations. The draft's average sentence length (30.52 words) is significantly higher than typical PLS texts, and its Flesch Reading Ease score (26.06) is very low, indicating difficult readability. The high number of passive voice constructions (31 instances) and a high density of complex and long words further contribute to the text's deviation from typical plain language patterns.",

The average sentence length (30.52 words) is well beyond the typical range (median <22.1), contributing to a very low Flesch Reading Ease score (26.06, below P10) and high grade-level scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 17.21, Gunning Fog Index 22.69, SMOG Index 17.32, all beyond P90).
