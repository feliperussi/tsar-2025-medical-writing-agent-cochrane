  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nWe wanted to find out if this therapy reduces symptoms and if it is safe. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that combines psychedelic substances - like psilocybin (magic mushrooms) or LSD - with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair). These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We wanted to determine if this therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and if it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWhat did we do? \nTo answer our question, we collected and analyzed the results from all relevant studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. We found 6 studies called randomized controlled trials. This is a type of study where people are put into different treatment groups at random to compare them fairly.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. Researchers conducted the studies, which lasted 6 to 12 months, in clinics in the USA and Switzerland. Organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy funded the studies, with no involvement from drug companies.\n\nWe compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD. The other type used MDMA (Ecstasy). Therapy using 'classical' psychedelics (like psilocybin and LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. The effect of therapy using MDMA ('Ecstasy') is very uncertain. Overall, while the therapy may help, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain.\n\nThe treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious unwanted effects reported. However, we need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality, and to address the limitations of current studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024. We need more research to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases. Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.",

This section is essential for readers who want the main takeaways at a glance. Additionally, several sections could be more concise and use simpler language to improve clarity for a patient audience. The following 3 improvements are needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Add a 'Key Messages' section.** The summary must begin with the key messages, which are provided in the source material. This is the most important part of the summary for many readers.\n   - **Suggestion:** Create a new section at the very top titled 'Key messages' and add the key findings as a bulleted list, based on the source text.\n\n2. **Simplify the aims to be more direct and less repetitive.** The two sentences in the 'What did we want to find out?' section say the same thing in different ways.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy... We wanted to determine if this therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and if it is safe and well-tolerated.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if psychedelic-assisted therapy is better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) for reducing anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life‑threatening diseases. We also looked at its safety and any unwanted effects.\"\n\n3. **Replace abstract research terms with simpler concepts.** The final paragraph uses language that is more familiar to researchers than to patients.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and should be designed in a way that makes the results more trustworthy.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of long and complex words was higher than is typical for this type of summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 77% of features falling within the best quartile for readability. However, two metrics deviate significantly from the norm: the SMOG index (14.18) and the count of long words (174). This indicates that while sentence structure is good, the vocabulary includes more complex (3+ syllable) and long words than is ideal, which can make the text more challenging for a lay audience to read."
