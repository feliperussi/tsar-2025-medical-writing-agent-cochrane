  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs (substances that can cause hallucinations) help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a type of therapy that uses psychedelic drugs, which are substances that can cause hallucinations, under the guidance of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being) and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence, in order to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated. We also wanted to explore the potential benefits and risks of using different types of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin and MDMA, in this context.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants' data being analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to placebo or active comparators. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment), which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and complete, but it needs significant edits to improve clarity for a patient audience. The main issues are very long, complex sentences and the use of passive, academic phrasing. Addressing the three points below will make the summary much easier for readers to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Break up long sentences that cover multiple ideas.**\nMany sentences are over 40 words long, making them difficult to follow. Break them into shorter sentences, each focusing on a single point.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being) and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 69-word sentence combines the need for more research, specific outcomes to study, and the limitations of current evidence all in one. It's too much information for a reader to process at once.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy. Future studies should look at its effects on quality of life and spirituality. This research must also solve the problems found in the current studies, like their small size and the difficulty in preventing people from knowing which treatment they received.\"\n\n**2. Simplify definitions and avoid repetition.**\nThe summary defines the same terms multiple times, which makes the text wordy and slows the reader down.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a type of therapy that uses psychedelic drugs, which are substances that can cause hallucinations, under the guidance of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The title already defined psychedelic drugs. This 58-word sentence repeats that definition and adds another long one, making the key message hard to grasp.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Therapy using psychedelic drugs may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain about this.\"\n\n**3. Use active voice to make the text more direct.**\nSome sentences use passive voice, which can feel indirect and academic. Using active voice makes it clearer who is doing what.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to placebo or active comparators.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is passive and impersonal. It's clearer to state that the researchers were the ones making the comparison.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD), and the other used MDMA (also known as 'Ecstasy').\"\n\nMaking these changes will help address the readability issues highlighted by the evaluation metrics and make the summary much more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that while the word count is acceptable, the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in terms of readability. Over half of the metrics (10 out of 18) fall into the P90 range, indicating the text is substantially more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Key metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (25.6), 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (14.9), 'passive_voice' (20 instances), and 'complex_words' (124) are all unusually high. This data supports the editorial feedback that the summary's long sentences, passive constructions, and complex vocabulary make it difficult for a general audience to read and understand."
