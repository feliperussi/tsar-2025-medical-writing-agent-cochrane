  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain about this.\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality, and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that combines psychedelic substances, like psilocybin or LSD, with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress. These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life. Current treatments for these conditions often include medication and therapy, but they may not be effective for everyone. Psychedelic-assisted therapy has been proposed as a potential new approach to treating these conditions.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWhat did we do?\nTo answer our question, we collected and analyzed the results from all relevant studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. We included 6 studies of a type called randomized controlled trials.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. Organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy funded the studies, with no involvement from drug companies. \nWe compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD. The other type used MDMA, also known as 'Ecstasy'. \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of undefined technical terms and jargon, and some instances of passive voice that make the text less direct. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define key terms and replace medical jargon.** Some terms are clear to researchers but may confuse patients. This is likely contributing to the high vocabulary complexity scores.\n   - **Quote:** \"...help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress.\" and \"...no serious adverse events reported.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Existential distress\" is a clinical term. \"Adverse events\" is medical jargon.\n   - **Suggestion:** Define the term on first use, as the source material does: \"...existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair).\" Replace jargon with simpler words: change \"adverse events\" to \"unwanted effects.\"\n\n2. **Add helpful context for drug names.** The draft misses an opportunity to use more familiar names for the drugs being studied, which would help reader understanding.\n   - **Quote:** \"One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD.\"\n   - **Problem:** While accurate, the original abstract includes a more common name for psilocybin that makes the information more accessible.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add the common name in parentheses: \"...classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') and LSD.\"\n\n3. **Use active voice to be more direct.** The draft contains several passive sentences that make it less clear who is performing the action. The goal is to have the subject of the sentence doing the verb.\n   - **Quote:** \"The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland.\"\n   - **Problem:** The passive phrase \"were conducted\" is less direct than naming the actor.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite in active voice: \"Researchers conducted the studies, which lasted 6 to 12 months, in clinics in the USA and Switzerland.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical patterns for sentence length and use of pronouns. However, it reveals significant deviation in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Five metrics are outside the typical range, most notably 'passive_voice' (BEYOND_P90), indicating a much higher use of passive constructions than is typical for a PLS. Additionally, metrics for vocabulary complexity like 'smog_index', 'complex_words', and 'long_words' are all in the P90 range, confirming that the text uses more complex and long words than is common in plain language summaries."
