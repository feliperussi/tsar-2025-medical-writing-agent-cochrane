  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases? \n\nWe found that psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain about this. \nWe need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality, and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used. \nFuture studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy? \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that combines psychedelic substances, like psilocybin (magic mushrooms) or LSD, with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair). \nThese conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life. \nCurrent treatments for these conditions often include medication and therapy, but they may not be effective for everyone. \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy has been proposed as a potential new approach to treating these conditions.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. \nWe aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWhat did we do? \nTo answer our question, we collected and analyzed the results from all relevant studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. \nWe included 6 studies of a type called randomized controlled trials.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them. \nThe age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. \nResearchers conducted the studies, which lasted 6 to 12 months, in clinics in the USA and Switzerland. \nOrganizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy funded the studies, with no involvement from drug companies. \nWe compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. \nOne type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD. \nThe other type used MDMA (Ecstasy). \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. \nThe treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious unwanted effects reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. \nFirst, the studies included only a small number of people. \nSecond, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

The main issue is the use of overly complex and formal vocabulary, which makes the text difficult to read. Additionally, some sentences use passive voice, which can make them less direct. Finally, the 'What did we find?' section should be broken into shorter paragraphs to improve readability and avoid repeating the key message verbatim. Addressing these three areas will significantly improve the summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation results show good conformity in some areas, with excellent sentence length (words_per_sentence in the best 25%) and use of pronouns. However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The SMOG index is beyond the 90th percentile, and metrics for complex words, Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words are all in the 75-90th percentile range. Passive voice usage is also high (75-90th percentile). These metrics indicate that while sentence structure is simple, the word choice is too advanced for a typical plain language summary."
