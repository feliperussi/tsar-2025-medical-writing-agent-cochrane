  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy uses psychedelic drugs under a therapist's guidance. This therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy. This includes its effects on quality of life and spirituality. We also need to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers. This includes long-term effects and potential unwanted effects. Studies should also work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence. This will provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that combines psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapy sessions. This helps people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress. These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life. Current treatments for these conditions often include medication and therapy, but they may not be effective for everyone. Psychedelic-assisted therapy has been proposed as a potential new approach to treating these conditions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments. They looked at anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. The authors aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated. They also wanted to explore the potential benefits and risks of using different types of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin and MDMA, in this context.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies investigating psychedelic-assisted therapy. This targeted anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life-threatening illnesses.\n\nHow did we collect and summarize the data?\nWe extracted relevant outcomes, summarized the results, and compiled the overall findings. This assessed the therapeutic impact of psychedelics in this population.\n\nHow sure are we about the evidence?\nWe evaluated the certainty of the evidence using established criteria, such as GRADE. We considered risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases. We analyzed data from 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to placebo or active comparators. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, reducing statistical power. Participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. To make it even clearer for a general audience, I have three main suggestions focusing on simplifying the language and using a more direct, active voice.\n\n1. **Simplify the Methods Section and Use a More Direct Voice.**\n   - **Problematic Text:** The sections 'How did we search for studies?' and 'How did we collect and summarize the data?' are written in a very formal, passive style that is difficult for lay readers to follow.\n   - **Quote 1:** \"We performed a systematic search for studies investigating psychedelic-assisted therapy. This targeted anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life‑threatening illnesses.\"\n   - **Quote 2:** \"We extracted relevant outcomes, summarized the results, and compiled the overall findings. This assessed the therapeutic impact of psychedelics in this population.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:**\n     - For 'How did we search for studies?': \"We searched for studies that looked at whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy could help people with life‑threatening illnesses who have anxiety, depression, or existential distress.\"\n     - For 'How did we collect and summarize the data?': \"We collected and combined the results from the studies to understand the effects of these therapies.\"\n\n2. **Explain Technical Terms in the Limitations Section.**\n   - **Problematic Text:** The limitations section uses several technical terms without explanation, which can prevent readers from understanding why the evidence is limited.\n   - **Quote:** \"Participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, it was difficult to 'blind' the studies, meaning participants likely knew if they were receiving the real drug or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This could have influenced the results.\"\n\n3. **Make the Aims Section More Concise and Consistent.**\n   - **Problematic Text:** The paragraph explaining the review's aims is repetitive and switches from third person ('The review authors') to first person ('we'), which can be confusing. The style guide requires using 'we' consistently.\n   - **Quote:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic‑assisted therapy... The authors aimed to determine whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy is effective...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if psychedelic‑assisted therapy is better than a placebo or other treatments for reducing anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‑threatening diseases. We also looked at its safety and compared the effects of different psychedelic drugs, like psilocybin and MDMA.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a very high number of passive sentences, complex words, and long words compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While some metrics like sentence length and active voice are good (in the best quartile), there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure. Five key metrics are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text has substantially more passive voice, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, and long words than is typical for a PLS. This results in high complexity scores on the SMOG and Coleman‑Liau indices, suggesting the text is harder to read than intended."
