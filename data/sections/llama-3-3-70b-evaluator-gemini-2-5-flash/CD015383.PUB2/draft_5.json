  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- Therapy using psychedelic drugs may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain about this.\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy. Future studies should look at its effects on quality of life and spirituality. This research must also solve the problems found in the current studies, like their small size and the difficulty in preventing people from knowing which treatment they received.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants' data being analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. \nThe researchers compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD. The other type used MDMA, also known as 'Ecstasy'. \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it is not approved because it's missing key sections that are essential for a reader's understanding. Here are the most important improvements needed:\n\n**1. Add a background section to explain the topic.**\nThe summary currently begins with 'What did we want to find out?'. A reader new to this topic won't know what 'psychedelic-assisted therapy' is. You should add a short introductory section before this.\n*   **Suggestion:** Add a new section with a heading like 'What is psychedelic-assisted therapy?'. You can base the text on the source material, for example: 'Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that combines psychedelic substances, like psilocybin or LSD, with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety and depression.'\n\n**2. Add a brief 'What did we do?' section.**\nThe summary jumps from the aims ('What did we want to find out?') to the findings ('What did we find?') without explaining how the review was done. This context is important for building trust and understanding.\n*   **Suggestion:** Add a short paragraph explaining your methods. For example: 'To answer our question, we collected and analysed the results from all relevant studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. We included 6 studies of a type called randomised controlled trials.'\n\n**3. Rewrite sentences to use the active voice.**\nThe style guide requires using the active voice ('We did this') instead of the passive voice ('This was done'). This makes the text more direct and easier to read. The linguistic analysis shows a higher-than-average use of passive voice.\n*   **Problematic sentence:** '...with 140 participants' data being analyzed.'\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** '...and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them.'\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy...'\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy funded the studies...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS statistical patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the passive voice count (16 instances) is in the 75th percentile, indicating a higher-than-average use which could be reduced to improve clarity."
