  "draft": "Key messages\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a type of therapy that uses psychedelic drugs, which are substances that can cause hallucinations, under the guidance of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being) and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence, in order to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases.\n\nCan therapy using psychedelic drugs (substances that can cause hallucinations) help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases? \nWe wanted to find out if this therapy reduces symptoms and if it is safe. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that combines psychedelic substances - like psilocybin (magic mushrooms) or LSD - with therapy sessions to help people cope with anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair). These conditions are common in people with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and can significantly impact their quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if psychedelic-assisted therapy is better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) for reducing anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We also looked at its safety and any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do? \nTo answer our question, we collected and analyzed the results from all relevant studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. We found 6 studies called randomized controlled trials. This is a type of study where people are put into different treatment groups at random to compare them fairly.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. Researchers conducted the studies, which lasted 6 to 12 months, in clinics in the USA and Switzerland. Organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy funded the studies, with no involvement from drug companies.\n\nWe compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD. The other type used MDMA (Ecstasy). Therapy using 'classical' psychedelics (like psilocybin and LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. The effect of therapy using MDMA ('Ecstasy') is very uncertain. Overall, while the therapy may help, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain.\n\nThe treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious unwanted effects reported. However, we need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality, and to address the limitations of current studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024. We need more research to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening diseases. Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should be designed in a way that makes the results more trustworthy.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too complex and academic, which could prevent readers from understanding the key takeaways and limitations of the research. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Language and Long Sentences**\n\nThe summary uses terms and sentence structures that are too academic. This is especially true in the final key message, which is hard to follow.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence, in order to provide clearer answers about the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life‑threatening diseases.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This 49‑word sentence is packed with abstract concepts like 'prioritize measuring outcomes', 'reduce biases', and 'quality of evidence' that are not clear to a non‑expert reader.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Future research should focus on what matters most to patients, like long‑term results and side effects. Researchers also need to design studies that provide more trustworthy results. This will give us clearer answers about how safe and helpful this therapy is.'\n\n**2. Clarify the Key Limitation of 'Blinding'**\n\nThe summary mentions the difficulty in keeping people unaware of their treatment, but it doesn't fully explain *why* this is a problem. Using plain language to explain this concept is crucial for reader understanding.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a bit vague. A lay reader might not understand how knowing you got the real drug could 'influence the results'.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Second, the effects of psychedelic drugs are very noticeable. This means participants likely knew if they had received the real drug or a placebo. This awareness, or expectation, could have influenced their reported outcomes.'\n\n**3. Make Sentences More Direct and Active**\n\nSome sentences are unnecessarily long or use indirect phrasing. Breaking them up and using more direct, active language will make the text easier to read.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'We found six studies that involved 149 people with life‑threatening diseases, and researchers analyzed data for 140 of them.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This compound sentence can be split into two shorter, simpler sentences for better readability.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found six studies with a total of 149 people with life‑threatening diseases. Researchers analyzed the data for 140 of these participants.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft's challenges with clarity are reflected in the linguistic metrics. Several scores for vocabulary complexity are significantly outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary (e.g., SMOG Index, Complex Words, and Long Words are all beyond the 90th percentile). This indicates the text uses too many multi‑syllable and uncommon words, making it difficult for a general audience to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 66.6% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, there is significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics—SMOG Index (16.15), Dale‑Chall complex words (281), complex words (157), and long words (241)—are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text is much more difficult to read than a typical PLS. The use of passive voice (21 instances) is also higher than usual (90th percentile), suggesting the text could be more direct and active."
