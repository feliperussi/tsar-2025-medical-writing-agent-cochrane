  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation (a procedure to empty the bowel) with oral antibiotics (medicines taken by mouth to kill bacteria) more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery (a planned surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is probably more effective than using mechanical bowel preparation alone in reducing complications, such as surgical site infections (infections that occur after surgery) and anastomotic leakages (leaks from the joined parts of the intestine), after elective colorectal surgery.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as, or better than, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these different approaches.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (SSIs, when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\n\nWhy is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?\nPreoperative bowel preparation is used to clear stool (poo) from the bowel and reduce the amount of bacteria living there, which can help prevent complications. This preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics prevents complications in elective colorectal surgery. We compared the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies took place in several countries. Most included surgeries on the colon and rectum for both cancerous ('malignant') and non-cancerous ('benign') reasons. The included studies used different types of laxatives and antibiotics, giving them in different amounts and at different times. Seventeen trials compared the combined method with mechanical bowel preparation alone, three trials compared the combined method with oral antibiotics alone, and one trial compared the combined method with no bowel preparation. The results suggest that for every 100 people having this surgery, the combined preparation method may prevent 4 to 6 surgical infections and 2 to 4 cases of leakage from the joined bowel.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined method reduces the number of surgical site infections or the risk of death when compared to oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of the combined method on the incidence of surgical site infections as well as mortality when compared to oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies comparing bowel preparation methods, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest (limited generalizability).\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While it passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy, the language is too complex and technical for a lay audience. The readability scores are extremely low, indicating the text requires a post-graduate reading level. Here are the top 4 improvements needed to make it understandable for patients and the public:\n\n1. **Simplify Key Messages and Define Terms First.** The opening sentences are dense with technical terms, which can overwhelm the reader. Introduce concepts simply before combining them.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is probably more effective than using mechanical bowel preparation alone in reducing complications, such as surgical site infections (infections that occur after surgery) and anastomotic leakages (leaks from the joined parts of the intestine), after elective colorectal surgery.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'After planned bowel surgery, patients can sometimes get infections or leaks where the bowel was rejoined. To prevent this, doctors may clean out the bowel using laxatives and also give antibiotics by mouth. We found that using both methods together is probably better at preventing these problems than using laxatives alone.'\n\n2. **Use Active Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases.** The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes sentences abstract and harder to read, violating the style guide's preference for direct verbs.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'We searched for studies comparing bowel preparation methods, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel for surgery. We then summarized their results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.'\n\n3. **Break Down Long, Complicated Sentences.** Many sentences contain multiple clauses and are over 40 words long, making them difficult to follow. Aim for one main idea per sentence.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as, or better than, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know if using oral antibiotics alone is as good as the combined method. It is also unclear if using no bowel preparation increases the risk of problems.'\n\n4. **Remove Redundant Statements.** The results section repeats the same point in two consecutive sentences, which could confuse readers who might search for a non-existent difference in meaning.\n    *   **Problematic sentences:** 'We are uncertain if the combined method reduces the number of surgical site infections or the risk of death when compared to oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of the combined method on the incidence of surgical site infections as well as mortality when compared to oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'When comparing the combined method to using oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, the evidence was unclear. We are uncertain if the combined method reduces surgical infections or the risk of death in these comparisons.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft's difficulty is reflected in the metrics. The Gunning Fog Index of 21.1 and Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 15.7 are far above the target range for plain language. This is caused by a very high number of complex words (206) and nominalizations (34), which should be significantly reduced to improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 11 of 18 metrics falling outside the median range. The text's readability is very low (Flesch Reading Ease: 23.88, BELOW_P10), corresponding to a post-graduate reading level (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 15.66, P90; Gunning Fog: 21.13, BEYOND_P90). This is driven by an extremely high number of complex and long words (complex_words: 206, BEYOND_P90) and a high rate of nominalization (34 instances, BEYOND_P90), where verbs are turned into nouns. While sentence length is borderline high (23.07 words, P75), its combination with difficult vocabulary makes the text very challenging for a lay audience."
