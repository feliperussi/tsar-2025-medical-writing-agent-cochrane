  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.\n- We are uncertain if using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as the combined method, or if not using any bowel preparation increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should compare the combined method with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\n\nWhy is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?\nWe use preoperative bowel preparation to remove feces from the bowel and reduce bacterial colonization, which can help prevent complications. This preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies were conducted in various countries and most investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. We compared the combined method with using laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation. When comparing the combined method to using oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, we are uncertain if it reduces infections or the risk of death. We need more evidence to be sure.\n\nCombining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery. However, it is unclear whether this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of surgical site infections and 2 to 4 cases of anastomotic leakage.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel for surgery. We then summarized their results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it is not yet ready for publication because the language is too technical for a general audience, making it difficult to understand. The key issues are the use of complex words and noun-heavy phrases where simpler verbs and descriptions would be clearer. Below are the top 3 improvements needed to make the summary more accessible for patients and the public.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace Technical Jargon with Simpler Language**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The studies were conducted in various countries and most investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"malignant and benign surgical indications\" is clinical jargon that a lay reader will not understand. It adds complexity without providing essential information.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"These studies took place in various countries and included people having surgery for both cancerous (malignant) and non-cancerous (benign) conditions.\"\n\n**2. Use Active Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Nominalizations)**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We use preoperative bowel preparation to remove feces from the bowel and reduce bacterial colonization, which can help prevent complications.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"Bacterial colonization\" is an abstract noun phrase. Using a direct verb makes the concept clearer and the sentence more active.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We use bowel preparation before surgery to clean out the bowel and reduce the number of bacteria living there. This can help prevent infections and other problems.\"\n\n**3. Simplify Wordy and Repetitive Phrases**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of surgical site infections and 2 to 4 cases of anastomotic leakage.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation\" is very long and makes the sentence difficult to follow.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This means that for every 100 people who receive the combined preparation, it may prevent 4 to 6 surgical infections and 2 to 4 cases of leakage where the bowel was joined.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, you will significantly improve the readability and clarity of the summary for your target audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length is good (P25), the summary deviates significantly on measures of vocabulary complexity. Key metrics like the SMOG index, complex words (Dale-Chall), and words with 3+ syllables are all 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text is much more difficult to read than a typical PLS. Additionally, the high number of nominalizations (P90) supports the editorial feedback to use more active verbs instead of complex noun phrases. These scores confirm that the main barrier to readability is word choice, not sentence structure."
