  "key_messages": [
    "Combining mechanical bowel preparation (a procedure to empty the bowel) with oral antibiotics (medicines taken by mouth to kill bacteria) is probably more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications, such as surgical site infections (infections that occur after surgery) and anastomotic leakages (leaks from the joined parts of the intestine), after elective colorectal surgery (a planned surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum).",
    "The review did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as, or better than, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these different approaches, and to improve our confidence in the results, particularly for specific types of colon and rectal surgeries."

      "subheading": "What is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?",
      "content": "Elective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (SSIs, when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death."

      "subheading": "Why is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?",
      "content": "Preoperative bowel preparation is used to remove feces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonization, which can help prevent complications. This preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies were conducted in various countries and most investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing for mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) as well as oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB). Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP, three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB, and one trial compared MBP+oAB versus no bowel preparation (nBP). The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as mortality when compared to oAB alone or nBP. No information was available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. The use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery. However, it is unclear whether this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of surgical site infections and 2 to 4 cases of anastomotic leakage."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest (limited generalizability).",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to December 2021."
