  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics probably lowers the risk of two key complications: wound infections (surgical site infections) and leaks where the bowel was rejoined (anastomotic leakage).\n- We are uncertain if using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as the combined method, or if not using any bowel preparation increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should compare the combined method with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to a longer recovery, lasting health problems, and even death.\n\nWhy do we use preoperative bowel preparation in elective colorectal surgery?\nWe use bowel preparation before surgery to clean out the bowel and reduce the number of bacteria living there. This can help prevent infections and other problems. The preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies with 5264 people who had planned bowel surgery. Our main finding comes from comparing the combined method (mechanical preparation plus antibiotics) with mechanical preparation alone. The combined method probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leaks from where the bowel was joined. This means that for every 100 people who receive the combined preparation, it may prevent 4 to 6 surgical infections and 2 to 4 cases of leakage. For this comparison, we found no clear difference in the risk of death, length of hospital stay, or the bowel being slow to start working again (postoperative ileus).\n\nThere was not enough evidence from the other comparisons to be certain. We are still uncertain if the combined method is better than using oral antibiotics alone, or better than no bowel preparation at all.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel for surgery. We then summarized their results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can bias the results. Also, some studies were very small, and the findings may not apply to everyone having this type of surgery.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are overly complex vocabulary and indirect sentence structures. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace technical terms with simpler, consistent language.** Even after defining terms, the draft continues to use technical language. This can be tiring for readers. The high number of complex words (148) and a SMOG index of 15.0 confirm the text is difficult to read.\n    *   **Example:** '...reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This reverts to jargon. Readers may not remember the definitions provided earlier. It also uses 'surgical site infections' after defining it as 'wound infections'.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** '...reducing the risk of wound infections, leaks where the bowel is joined, and other complications.'\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.** The draft frequently uses noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which makes sentences less direct and harder to understand. The analysis identified 27 nominalizations, placing the text in the 90th percentile for this metric.\n    *   **Example:** 'The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'reducing the risk of infection' is an abstract noun phrase. A simple verb is clearer.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'This helps prevent infections and other complications, making surgery safer.'\n\n3. **Use active voice to clarify who is doing what.** Some sentences use passive voice, which can be vague. The style guide recommends using active voice to make it clear who is performing the action.\n    *   **Example:** 'The preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** It's unclear who performs this action. Is it the doctor or the patient? Using 'you' makes it more personal and clear.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'You can prepare for surgery by using enemas or laxatives (mechanical preparation) and/or by taking antibiotics by mouth.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity in sentence-level metrics like words per sentence (18.34, P25) and use of pronouns (32, P75). However, it reveals significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics like the SMOG index (15.0, BEYOND_P90) and the count of complex words (148, BEYOND_P90) are exceptionally high, indicating the language is too technical for a lay audience. Additionally, the high number of nominalizations (27, P90) points to an overly formal and abstract writing style that should be simplified."
