  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation (a procedure to empty the bowel) with oral antibiotics (medicines taken by mouth to kill bacteria) more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery (a planned surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum)?\n\nKey messages:\n- After planned bowel surgery, patients can sometimes get infections or leaks where the bowel was rejoined. To prevent this, doctors may clean out the bowel using laxatives and also give antibiotics by mouth. We found that using both methods together is probably better at preventing these problems than using laxatives alone.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know if using oral antibiotics alone is as good as the combined method. It is also unclear if using no bowel preparation increases the risk of problems.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these different approaches.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (SSIs, when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\n\nWhy is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?\nPreoperative bowel preparation is used to remove feces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonization, which can help prevent complications. This preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies were conducted in various countries and most investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing for mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) as well as oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB). Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP, three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB, and one trial compared MBP+oAB versus no bowel preparation (nBP). The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as mortality when compared to oAB alone or nBP. \n\nWe are uncertain if the combined method reduces surgical infections or the risk of death in these comparisons. The use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery. However, it is unclear whether this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of surgical site infections and 2 to 4 cases of anastomotic leakage.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel for surgery. We then summarized their results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest (limited generalizability).\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. All the essential information is here, and the facts are accurate. However, the language is often too technical and academic for a general audience. To make this summary easier for patients and the public to understand, I recommend focusing on the following three improvements:\n\n1.  **Replace technical terms with everyday language.** Some sentences contain medical jargon that will be unfamiliar to most readers. Simplifying these terms will significantly improve clarity.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"Preoperative bowel preparation is used to remove feces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonization, which can help prevent complications.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"bowel lumen\" and \"bacterial colonization\" are highly technical. \"Feces\" is also a clinical term.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Before surgery, the bowel is cleaned out to remove stool (poo) and reduce the amount of bacteria. This can help prevent infections.\"\n\n2.  **Use more direct, active language instead of complex noun phrases.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations) and passive constructions, which can make sentences dense and difficult to follow.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing for mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) as well as oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB).\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and abstract due to words like \"regimens,\" \"dosage,\" and \"preparation.\" It reads like a technical report.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies we found used different types, doses, and timings of laxatives and oral antibiotics to prepare the bowel for surgery.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify and simplify the structure of the results.** The 'What did we find?' section presents key findings in a slightly confusing order and includes some repetition that could be streamlined.\n    *   **Original sentences:** \"The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as mortality when compared to oAB alone or nBP. We are uncertain if the combined method reduces surgical infections or the risk of death in these comparisons.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** These two sentences say the same thing in slightly different ways, which is unnecessary. The first sentence is also very technical.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"When comparing the combined method to using oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, we are uncertain if it reduces infections or the risk of death. We need more evidence to be sure.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help ensure the summary is accessible and clear for your intended audience. The linguistic analysis supports these suggestions, showing that the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations, which makes it harder to read than a typical Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with only 28% of features in the best quartile. The text deviates significantly in key areas related to readability. Metrics for vocabulary complexity (smog_index, complex_words, long_words, dale_chall_readability) and sentence structure (nominalization) are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the language is much more complex and noun-heavy than a typical PLS. The Flesch Reading Ease score is also very low (in the bottom 10th percentile), confirming the text is difficult to read."
