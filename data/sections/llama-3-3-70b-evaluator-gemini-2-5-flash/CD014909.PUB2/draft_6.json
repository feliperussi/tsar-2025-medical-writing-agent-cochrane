  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation (a procedure to empty the bowel) with oral antibiotics (medicines taken by mouth to kill bacteria) more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery (a planned surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is probably more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications, such as surgical site infections (infections that occur after surgery) and anastomotic leakages (leaks from the joined parts of the intestine), after elective colorectal surgery.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as, or better than, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these different approaches.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (SSIs, when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\n\nWhy is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?\nBefore surgery, the bowel is cleaned out to remove stool (poo) and reduce the amount of bacteria. This can help prevent infections. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies were conducted in various countries and most investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. The studies used different types, doses, and timings of laxatives and oral antibiotics to prepare the bowel for surgery. We compared the combined method with using laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation. When comparing the combined method to using oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, we are uncertain if it reduces infections or the risk of death. We need more evidence to be sure.\n\nThe use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery. However, it is unclear whether this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of surgical site infections and 2 to 4 cases of anastomotic leakage.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel for surgery. We then summarized their results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, the language is too complex for a lay audience, making it difficult to understand key findings. To improve clarity, I recommend focusing on the top 3 improvements listed below.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Rephrase Noun-Heavy Sentences to Use Active Verbs:** The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes sentences long and indirect. Changing these to simple verbs will make the text more direct and easier to read.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"The use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Starting with \"The use of...\" is wordy and less direct. It buries the main action of the sentence.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leakage after planned colorectal surgery.\"\n\n**2. Break Down Long, Complicated Sentences:** Some sentences contain multiple clauses and comparisons that are hard for readers to follow in a single thought.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as, or better than, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** At 43 words, this sentence forces the reader to track several different comparisons at once, which can be confusing.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be sure about two other approaches. We are uncertain if using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as the combined method. We are also uncertain if using no bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.\"\n\n**3. Simplify Repetitive Technical Phrases:** The full name of the intervention is repeated often, making the text dense. After defining it once, you can use a simpler term.\n\n*   **Problematic phrase:** \"combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This 8-word technical phrase is used multiple times, adding to the word count and cognitive load for the reader.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** After the first use, switch to simpler terms like \"the combined method,\" \"this combined approach,\" or \"using both methods together.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help address the high number of nominalizations (28), complex words (196), and long words (223) identified in the analysis, which will significantly improve the summary's readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word count limit and uses an appropriate number of pronouns and active voice constructions. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in readability and vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics fall into the 'BEYOND_P90' category, indicating the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS. Notably, the Flesch Reading Ease score (27.06) is very low, and metrics for nominalizations (28), complex words (196), and long words (223) are exceptionally high. This suggests the primary issues are overly academic sentence structures and vocabulary, which need to be simplified."
