  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.\n- We are uncertain if using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as the combined method, or if not using any bowel preparation increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should compare the combined method with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\n\nWhy do we use preoperative bowel preparation in elective colorectal surgery?\nWe use bowel preparation before surgery to clean out the bowel and reduce the number of bacteria living there. This can help prevent infections and other problems. The preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. These studies took place in various countries and included people having surgery for both cancerous (malignant) and non-cancerous (benign) conditions. We compared the combined method with using laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation. When comparing the combined method to using oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, we are uncertain if it reduces infections or the risk of death. We need more evidence to be sure.\n\nCombining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery. However, it is unclear whether this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. This means that for every 100 people who receive the combined preparation, it may prevent 4 to 6 surgical infections and 2 to 4 cases of leakage where the bowel was joined.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel for surgery. We then summarized their results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft with a clear structure and all the necessary sections. However, it is not yet ready for publication because several clarity issues could confuse a lay reader. The main problems are the use of undefined technical terms and a results section that is difficult to follow. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to improve clarity and make the summary more accessible for patients and the public.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Define Key Technical Terms for the Reader**\n\nSome of the most important terms in the summary are left unexplained, which will make it hard for readers to understand the key findings.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** In the Key Messages, you mention \"anastomotic leakage\" without a definition. Later, in the results, you use the term \"postoperative ileus\" with no explanation at all.\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Patients won't know what these complications are, making the results less meaningful. The goal of a PLS is to avoid forcing readers to look up medical jargon.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Add simple, parenthetical definitions immediately after the terms. \n    *   For the Key Message: \"...reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage **(leaks from where the bowel is joined back together)** after elective colorectal surgery.\"\n    *   For the Results: \"...it is unclear whether this approach has an effect on mortality, **postoperative ileus (a condition where the bowel is slow to start working again after surgery)**, or length of hospital stay.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Clinical Language to Be More Direct**\n\nThe summary sometimes uses clinical phrasing where simpler, everyday language would be clearer and more impactful.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"Impaired long-term health\" is vague and clinical. Using more direct words helps the reader immediately grasp the seriousness of the complications.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"These complications can lead to a **longer recovery, lasting health problems**, and even death.\"\n\n**3. Restructure the 'What did we find?' Section for Clarity**\n\nThe current results section mixes findings from different comparisons, which makes it difficult to follow the main message.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** The paragraph begins by stating the number of studies and participants, then jumps to an uncertain finding (\"When comparing the combined method to using oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, we are uncertain...\"), before presenting the main, more certain finding.\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This structure buries the lead. Readers should be presented with the most important and certain finding first, followed by the areas of uncertainty.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Restructure the entire section to tell a clearer story. For example:\n\n    \"We found 21 studies involving 5264 people who had elective colorectal surgery.\n\n    Our main finding comes from comparing the **combined method (mechanical preparation plus antibiotics) with mechanical preparation alone**. The combined method probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leaks from where the bowel was joined. This means that for every 100 people who receive the combined preparation, it may prevent 4 to 6 surgical infections and 2 to 4 cases of leakage. For this comparison, we found no clear difference in the risk of death, length of hospital stay, or the bowel being slow to start working again.\n\n    There was not enough evidence from the other comparisons to be certain. We are still uncertain if the combined method is better than using **oral antibiotics alone**, or better than **no bowel preparation** at all.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nYour own editorial instincts about simplifying the text are backed up by the evaluation metrics. The analysis found that the draft has a very high number of complex words (the `smog_index` and `complex_words` metrics were 'Beyond P90', meaning they are much higher than is typical for a PLS). The number of `nominalization`s (noun-forms of verbs) was also high. Implementing the suggestions above, especially using simpler words and more direct verbs, will help improve these scores and, more importantly, make the summary much easier for your audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and use of pronouns are good, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Metrics like the SMOG index, complex word count, and Dale-Chall readability score are all in the P90 range or beyond, indicating the language is more technical than is typical for a PLS. The high number of nominalizations (P90) also suggests that sentence structures could be more direct and verb-focused."
