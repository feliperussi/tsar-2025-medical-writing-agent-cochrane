  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is probably more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications, such as surgical site infections and anastomotic leakages, after elective colorectal surgery.\n- The review did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as, or better than, combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics with oral antibiotics alone, or with no bowel preparation, to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these different approaches.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with potential complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum don't heal properly) and surgical site infections (SSIs, when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, impaired long-term health, and even death.\n\nWhy is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?\nPreoperative bowel preparation is used to remove feces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonization, which can help prevent complications. This preparation can be done mechanically (using enemas or laxatives) and/or with oral antibiotics. The goal is to make the surgery safer by reducing the risk of infection and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications in elective colorectal surgery. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of this combined approach with mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, in reducing the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies were conducted in various countries and most investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing for mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) as well as oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB). Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP, three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB, and one trial compared MBP+oAB versus no bowel preparation (nBP). The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as mortality when compared to oAB alone or nBP. The use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest (limited generalizability).\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

It has critical issues with completeness and factual accuracy, and its language is too complex for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Missing Section:** The required 'Methods' section, which explains how the review was conducted, is missing.\n2.  **Factual Inaccuracy:** The 'What did we find?' section misrepresents the review's main conclusion. It states that the combined method is probably better, but fails to clarify this was only when compared to *mechanical preparation alone*, not against all other options.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Correct the Main Finding for Accuracy and Clarity:** The current summary of the results is misleading and could give readers a false impression of the evidence.\n- **Original:** 'The use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.'\n- **Problem:** This is only true for one of the comparisons made in the review. As written, it incorrectly implies a universal benefit.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Compared with using mechanical bowel preparation alone, using the combined method probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leakage from the joined bowel. We did not find enough evidence to know if the combined method was better than using oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation at all.'\n\n**2. Replace Technical Jargon with Plain Language:** The text uses many clinical terms that will be unfamiliar to patients. This is confirmed by the evaluation, which found the number of complex and long words to be far outside the typical range for a PLS, resulting in very poor readability scores.\n- **Original:** '...remove feces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonization...'\n- **Problem:** 'Lumen' and 'bacterial colonization' are technical terms.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** '...clear stool (poo) from the bowel and reduce the amount of bacteria living there.'\n- **Original:** 'The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing...'\n- **Problem:** 'Regimens', 'agent(s)', and 'dosage' are clinical jargon.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The studies used different types of laxatives and antibiotics, giving them in different amounts and at different times.'\n\n**3. Use Active Verbs Instead of Noun-Heavy Phrases:** The draft relies heavily on abstract nouns (nominalizations), making sentences dense and indirect. The analysis confirms this with a nominalization count of 29, more than double the typical amount for a PLS.\n- **Original:** 'The review authors wanted to assess the evidence for using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation to prevent complications...'\n- **Problem:** This phrasing is indirect and wordy. Using 'we' and a direct verb is clearer and aligns with style guidelines.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We wanted to find out if combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics prevents complications...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that this draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, primarily due to high complexity. All readability scores indicate the text is very difficult for a lay audience to understand; for example, the Flesch Reading Ease score of 22.86 is far below the typical range of 32-48. This is driven by an excessive number of complex words (173, BEYOND_P90), long words (193, P90), and unfamiliar Dale-Chall words (285, BEYOND_P90). Structurally, the text is also problematic, with a very high count of nominalizations (29, BEYOND_P90), which are noun-forms of verbs that make sentences less direct and harder to process."
