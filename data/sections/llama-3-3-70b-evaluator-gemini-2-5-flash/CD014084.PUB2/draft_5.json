  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there is not enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, antibiotic use, or lung flare-ups.\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future studies should be larger and follow people for at least a year. This will help us learn the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyps and symptoms. Researchers should also track important outcomes like survival and consider how new CF treatments might affect the results.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids (mucus), which can block tubes and passages. This mucus can build up in the sinuses. This causes long-term swelling (called chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths in the nose called nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis often undergo medical treatment to manage their symptoms, including nasal irrigation - rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution - and the use of antibiotics to prevent infections. Doctors may suggest surgery to open the sinuses so that medicines can work better. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, used antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence to see how surgery affected people's nose and lung function.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study was conducted over an unspecified duration and included participants aged 19 to 28 years. The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the sinuses, or means people use fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022 for the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and September 2022 for other databases.",

The feedback below focuses on minor refinements to make the language even more direct and accessible for a lay audience. Addressing these points will elevate the summary from good to great.\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The text sometimes uses noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences less active and slightly more formal than necessary. The linguistic analysis confirms this is the main area for improvement.\n   - **Example:** \"...and the use of antibiotics to prevent infections.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...and taking antibiotics to prevent infections.\"\n   - **Another Example:** \"People with cystic fibrosis often undergo medical treatment to manage their symptoms...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"People with cystic fibrosis often manage their symptoms with medical treatments...\"\n\n2. **Simplify the description of the methods.** The explanation of how the evidence was assessed contains some research-specific phrasing that could be simplified.\n   - **Example:** \"We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence to see how surgery affected people's nose and lung function.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We summarized the results from the study and judged how reliable the evidence was.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the term 'lung flare-ups'.** This is a good plain language term, but providing a brief definition would be helpful for readers who may not be familiar with it.\n   - **Context:** The term is used in the 'Key messages' and 'What did the review authors want to find out?' sections.\n   - **Suggestion:** When first used, define it in parentheses: \"...or had lung flare-ups (periods when their lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores, sentence length, and use of active voice are all excellent. The single area for improvement identified by the analysis is a high rate of nominalization (21 instances), which places the draft in the 90th percentile for this metric. This aligns with the editorial feedback to replace noun phrases with more direct verbs to improve clarity."
