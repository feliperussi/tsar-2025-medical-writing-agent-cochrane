  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there is not enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, taking antibiotics, or having lung flare-ups (periods when their lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future studies should be larger and follow people for at least a year. This will help us learn the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyps and symptoms. Researchers should also track important outcomes like survival and consider how new CF treatments might affect the results.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids (mucus), which can block tubes and passages. This mucus can build up in the sinuses, causing long-term swelling (called chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths in the nose called nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis manage their symptoms with medical treatments, including rinsing their nasal passages with a saline solution (nasal irrigation) and taking antibiotics to prevent infections. Doctors may suggest surgery to open the sinuses so that medicines can work better. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, took antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups (periods when their lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We summarized the results from the study and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study was conducted over an unspecified duration and included participants aged 19 to 28 years. The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the sinuses, or means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022 for the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and September 2022 for other databases.",

The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to refine technical language and improve flow, making the summary even more accessible for readers.\n\n1. **Simplify the description of the study groups.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is quite technical and uses formal terms like 'intervention' and 'in combination with'. Describing what happened to people in simpler terms makes the results easier to grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In the study, one group had sinus surgery followed by nasal rinsing, while the other group used only nasal rinsing.\"\n\n2. **Avoid repeating definitions.**\n   - **Problematic text:** The definition \"(periods when their lung symptoms suddenly get worse)\" appears after \"lung flare-ups\" in both the key messages and in the section 'What did the review authors want to find out?'.\n   - **Why it's an issue:** It's excellent that you define this key term, but defining it once at the first mention is sufficient. Repeating the exact same definition interrupts the reading flow.\n   - **Suggested action:** Please remove the parenthetical definition the second time it appears.\n\n3. **Simplify the evidence currency statement.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is up to date to July 2022 for the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and September 2022 for other databases.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The distinction between different search databases is a technical detail that is not necessary for a plain language summary. It can be simplified for clarity without losing essential meaning.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Key strengths include good sentence length (17 words on average) and high use of active voice. The only notable deviation is the count of Dale-Chall complex words, which is higher than typical, suggesting some vocabulary could be simplified. The feedback provided aims to address this by refining technical descriptions."
