  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there is not enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, taking antibiotics, or having lung flare-ups (periods when their lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future studies should be larger and follow people for at least a year. This will help us learn the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyps and symptoms. Researchers should also track important outcomes like survival and consider how new CF treatments might affect the results.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids (mucus), which can block tubes and passages. This mucus can build up in the sinuses, causing long-term swelling (called chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths in the nose called nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis manage their symptoms with medical treatments, including rinsing their nasal passages with a saline solution (nasal irrigation) and taking antibiotics to prevent infections. Doctors may suggest surgery to open the sinuses so that medicines can work better. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, took antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We summarized the results from the study and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. In the study, one group had sinus surgery followed by nasal rinsing, while the other group used only nasal rinsing. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the sinuses, or means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

All information must align with the provided source materials.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change the date to match the source: \"The evidence is up to date to **July 2022**.\"\n\n**Top 2 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Opening Message:** The first paragraph contains a very long and complex sentence that makes the main takeaway harder to grasp.\n    *   **In the draft:** \"We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, taking antibiotics, or having lung flare-ups (periods when their lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is 33 words long and lists many outcomes. While the summary's average sentence length is excellent, this specific sentence is an outlier that reduces readability at a crucial point.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into two shorter, more focused sentences. For example: \"We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections. It is also uncertain if it means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups (when lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\"\n\n2.  **Make Key Terminology Consistent:** The summary uses different terms for the same concept, which can confuse readers.\n    *   **In the draft:** You use \"bacterial infections\" in the key messages but \"reduces bacteria in the sinuses\" in the results section (\"What did we find?\").\n    *   **Problem:** Readers may wonder if these are different things. Using the same term throughout improves clarity.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use the clearer term \"bacterial infections\" in both places. Change the results sentence to: \"...reduces **bacterial infections**, or means people take fewer antibiotics...\"",
