  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there is not enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections. It is also uncertain if it means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups (when lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future studies should be larger and follow people for at least a year. This will help us learn the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyps and symptoms. Researchers should also track important outcomes like survival and consider how new CF treatments might affect the results.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. In the sinuses, this mucus can cause long-term swelling (chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths called nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis manage their symptoms with medical treatments, including rinsing their nasal passages with a saline solution (nasal irrigation) and taking antibiotics to prevent infections. Doctors may suggest surgery to open the sinuses so that medicines can work better. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared endoscopic sinus surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, took antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We summarized the results from the study and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. In the study, one group had endoscopic sinus surgery followed by nasal rinsing, while the other group used only nasal rinsing. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial infections, or means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a very well-written draft that is clear, concise, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. However, I am recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' to allow for a few structural improvements that will significantly enhance the reader's ability to quickly grasp the most important information. My suggestions focus on making the key messages more scannable and adding a bit more substance to the methods description.\n\nHere are the top 2 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the Key Messages More Scannable**\n   - **The Issue:** The main findings at the top of the summary are presented in a single paragraph. This format makes it difficult for readers to quickly scan and understand the most important takeaways.\n   - **Quote:** \"We do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there is not enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections. It is also uncertain if it means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups (when lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Convert this paragraph into a short introductory sentence followed by a bulleted list. This makes the key points stand out immediately.\n     *Example:*\n     \"We reviewed the evidence on whether surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. Because we found only one small study, the evidence is not strong.\n     - We are uncertain if surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial infections, or means people need to take fewer antibiotics.\n     - We are also uncertain if surgery reduces lung flare-ups (when lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\n     - The study did not report any serious harmful effects, but it was too small to be certain about the risks.\"\n\n2. **Add More Detail to the Methods Section**\n   - **The Issue:** The description of the methods is very generic and doesn't provide much useful information for the reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"How did we find and assess the evidence? We searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We summarized the results from the study and judged how reliable the evidence was.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Add a brief, simple explanation of the type of studies you looked for. This adds transparency without introducing complex jargon.\n     *Example:*\n     \"How did we find and assess the evidence?\n     We searched for studies where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group had sinus surgery plus medical treatment, and the other had medical treatment alone. We then compared the results from the groups and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the expected ranges, with 89% in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Metrics for sentence length (15.7 words, P25), passive voice (6 instances, P25), and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.6, P25) are excellent. The feedback focuses on structural improvements rather than sentence-level issues, as the core writing is statistically sound."
