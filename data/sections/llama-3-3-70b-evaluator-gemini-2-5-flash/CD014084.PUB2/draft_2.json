  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe don't know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there isn't enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, antibiotic use, or lung flare-ups.\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least a year to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis, symptoms, and important outcomes like mortality, and consider the impact of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.\n\n### What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids, which can block tubes and passages. This leads to secretions building up in the sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and nasal polyps. Nasal polyps are growths that develop in the nasal passages, making it difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of infections.\n\n### What are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis often undergo medical treatment to manage their symptoms, including nasal irrigation and the use of antibiotics to prevent infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to open up the sinuses and allow medical treatment to work properly. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effects of sinus surgery alone or in combination with medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone on both nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. They also aimed to evaluate the impact of sinus surgery on hospitalization rates, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbation rates.\n\n### How did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing sinus surgery with medical treatment, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effects of surgery on nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study was conducted over an unspecified duration and included participants aged 19 to 28 years. The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone. It is unclear if endoscopic sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis is effective. The addition of surgical intervention to medical treatment may or may not improve nasal symptoms, reduce bacterial colonization, decrease the use of antibiotics, or reduce pulmonary exacerbations. We are also uncertain whether the addition of surgery to medical treatment leads to changes in pulmonary function.\n\n### What are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and there were too few studies overall, making the results for the outcomes uncertain.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022 for the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and September 2022 for other databases.",

However, the writing style is too academic for a plain language summary, making it difficult for patients to read and understand. The evaluation metrics confirm this, showing very long sentences and complex vocabulary. Here are the top 3 improvements to make the summary more accessible:\n\n1. **Shorten and simplify long sentences.** Many sentences are too long and contain too many ideas, making them hard to follow.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The review authors wanted to determine the effects of sinus surgery alone or in combination with medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone on both nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 46 words, this sentence is extremely long and complex. A reader will likely get lost trying to track the different comparisons and conditions.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function.\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of complex nouns (nominalizations).** The text often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes it sound abstract and less direct.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The addition of surgical intervention to medical treatment may or may not improve nasal symptoms, reduce bacterial colonization, decrease the use of antibiotics, or reduce pulmonary exacerbations.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"addition of surgical intervention\" and \"bacterial colonization\" are abstract and hard to understand. Using direct verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the sinuses, or means people use fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\"\n\n3. **Replace technical terms and wordy phrases with everyday language.**\n   - **Original sentence:** \"They also aimed to evaluate the impact of sinus surgery on hospitalization rates, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbation rates.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Evaluate the impact of\" is a wordy phrase, and \"pulmonary exacerbation rates\" is medical jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, used antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (67%) falling in the P90 range or beyond. Key issues identified by the metrics include extremely long sentences (words_per_sentence at 27.41), a very high number of nominalizations (32 instances, beyond the 90th percentile), and high vocabulary complexity, leading to poor readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 15.3)."
