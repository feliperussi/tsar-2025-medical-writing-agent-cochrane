  "draft": "# Is surgery to remove nasal polyps (abnormal growths in the nose) helpful for people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether surgery to remove nasal polyps (abnormal growths in the nose) is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs), in terms of improving nasal symptoms or reducing complications such as bacterial colonization, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary (lung) exacerbations.\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least a year to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis, symptoms, and important outcomes like mortality (death), and consider the impact of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.\n**Introduction**\n### What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, genetic disease that affects the secretions of the body, leading to abnormal electrolyte concentrations in exocrine secretions. This results in secretion stasis in paranasal sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and nasal polyposis. Nasal polyposis is a condition where growths called polyps develop in the nasal passages, making it difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of infections.\n### What are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis often undergo medical treatment to manage their symptoms, including nasal irrigation and the use of antibiotics to prevent infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to open up the sinuses and allow medical treatment to work properly. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effects of sinus surgery alone or in combination with medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone on both nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. They also aimed to evaluate the impact of sinus surgery on hospitalization rates, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbation rates.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing sinus surgery with medical treatment, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effects of surgery on nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study was conducted over an unspecified duration and included participants aged 19 to 28 years. The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone. No information was available on the study funding sources or the countries in which the study took place. It is unclear if endoscopic sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis is effective. The addition of surgical intervention to medical treatment may or may not improve nasal symptoms, reduce bacterial colonization, decrease the use of antibiotics, or reduce pulmonary exacerbations. We are also uncertain whether the addition of surgery to medical treatment leads to changes in pulmonary function.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and there were too few studies overall, making the results for the outcomes uncertain.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022.",
