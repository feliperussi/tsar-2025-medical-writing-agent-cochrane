  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there is not enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections. It is also uncertain if it means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups (when lung symptoms suddenly get worse).\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future studies should be larger and follow people for at least a year. This will help us learn the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyps and symptoms. Researchers should also track important outcomes like survival and consider how new CF treatments might affect the results.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids (mucus), which can block tubes and passages. This mucus can build up in the sinuses, causing long-term swelling (called chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths in the nose called nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis manage their symptoms with medical treatments, including rinsing their nasal passages with a saline solution (nasal irrigation) and taking antibiotics to prevent infections. Doctors may suggest surgery to open the sinuses so that medicines can work better. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, took antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We summarized the results from the study and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. In the study, one group had sinus surgery followed by nasal rinsing, while the other group used only nasal rinsing. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial infections, or means people take fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a well-written summary that is clear and easy to read. However, it cannot be approved because of a factual error in the search date. Here are the critical correction and two other suggestions to make the summary even better:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the search date for accuracy.**\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** 'The evidence is up to date to July 2022.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is factually incorrect. The original abstract states that searches were run as late as September 2022. Stating an earlier date misrepresents how current the review is.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The evidence is up to date to September 2022.'\n\n2. **Improve precision when describing the treatment.**\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** 'In the study, one group had sinus surgery followed by nasal rinsing, while the other group used only nasal rinsing.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The summary omits the specific type of surgery, 'endoscopic', which is used in both the original abstract and the source material. Including this term adds useful precision without being overly technical, as 'endoscopic' is a common term for minimally invasive surgery.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'In the study, one group had endoscopic sinus surgery followed by nasal rinsing, while the other group used only nasal rinsing.'\n\n3. **Make the description of cystic fibrosis more concise.**\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** 'It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids (mucus), which can block tubes and passages. This mucus can build up in the sinuses...'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This explanation is slightly wordy and repetitive ('fluids (mucus)... This mucus'). It can be streamlined for better flow and readability.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. In the sinuses, this mucus can cause long-term swelling (chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths called nasal polyps.'\n\nThe linguistic metrics for this draft are excellent, showing it is already very readable. These changes will ensure it is also factually precise and as clear as possible for the reader.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Nearly all metrics, including readability scores and sentence length, fall within the best quartile of our reference corpus, indicating excellent clarity and simple structure. The text uses active voice effectively and keeps sentences short. The feedback provided focuses on a critical factual correction and minor refinements that are not captured by the statistical analysis."
