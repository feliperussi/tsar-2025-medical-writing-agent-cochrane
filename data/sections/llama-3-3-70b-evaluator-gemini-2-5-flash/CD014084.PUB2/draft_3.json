  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe don't know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there isn't enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, antibiotic use, or lung flare-ups.\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least a year to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis, symptoms, and important outcomes like mortality, and consider the impact of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids, which can block tubes and passages. This leads to secretions building up in the sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - a condition where the sinuses are inflamed for a long time - and nasal polyps. Nasal polyps are growths that develop in the nasal passages, making it difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of infections.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis often undergo medical treatment to manage their symptoms, including nasal irrigation - rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution - and the use of antibiotics to prevent infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to open up the sinuses and allow medical treatment to work properly. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, used antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing sinus surgery with medical treatment, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effects of surgery on nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study was conducted over an unspecified duration and included participants aged 19 to 28 years. The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the sinuses, or means people use fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and there were too few studies overall, making the results for the outcomes uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022 for the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and September 2022 for other databases.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for structure and accuracy, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often more complex than necessary, which could make it difficult for patients to understand the key messages. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the number of studies in the 'Limitations' section.** The review found only one study, but the text refers to 'studies' in the plural. This is a factual error that could confuse the reader about the strength of the evidence.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and there were too few studies overall...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex vocabulary and technical terms.** Some sentences use clinical terms and complex words where simpler, everyday language would be clearer.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This leads to secretions building up in the sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - a condition where the sinuses are inflamed for a long time - and nasal polyps.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This causes thick fluids (secretions) to build up in the sinuses. This can lead to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is long-term inflammation of the sinuses, and growths called nasal polyps.\"\n\n3. **Replace abstract nouns (nominalizations) with active verbs.** Some sentences are wordy and abstract because they use noun forms instead of direct verbs. Using more verbs will make the text more direct and easier to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We searched for studies comparing sinus surgery with medical treatment, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effects of surgery on nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence to see how surgery affected people's nose and lung function.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found that the number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations were all higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, placing them in the P90 range.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with most metrics in the best quartile or median ranges. However, five metrics related to vocabulary complexity deviate significantly from the typical range (P90), including the number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations (noun-form verbs). This suggests the text could be made easier to read by simplifying word choices and sentence structures."
