  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe don't know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis. This is because there isn't enough strong evidence. We are unsure if surgery improves nasal symptoms or reduces problems like bacterial infections, antibiotic use, or lung flare-ups.\n- The available study did not report any serious harmful effects from the surgery, but it was very small and did not provide enough information to draw firm conclusions.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least a year to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis, symptoms, and important outcomes like mortality, and consider the impact of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease. It causes the body's glands to produce thick, sticky fluids (secretions), which can block tubes and passages. This leads to secretions building up in the sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - a condition where the sinuses are inflamed for a long time - and nasal polyps. Nasal polyps are growths that develop in the nasal passages, making it difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of infections.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis often undergo medical treatment to manage their symptoms, including nasal irrigation - rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution - and the use of antibiotics to prevent infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to open up the sinuses and allow medical treatment to work properly. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a common procedure used to treat nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We compared surgery to medical treatments alone to see the effects on their nose and lung function. We also looked at whether surgery changed how often people were hospitalized, used antibiotics, or had lung flare-ups.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence to see how surgery affected people's nose and lung function.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study was conducted over an unspecified duration and included participants aged 19 to 28 years. The intervention used was endoscopic sinus surgery in combination with nasal irrigation, compared to nasal irrigation alone. We are not sure if adding surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the sinuses, or means people use fewer antibiotics or have fewer lung flare-ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we found only one very small study. This makes the results uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022 for the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and September 2022 for other databases.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While it is well-structured and factually accurate, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of technical vocabulary and complex sentence structures, which make the text harder to read than necessary. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify technical descriptions and vocabulary.** Some sentences use medical terms where simpler language would be clearer for patients.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** 'This leads to secretions building up in the sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - a condition where the sinuses are inflamed for a long time - and nasal polyps.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'This mucus can build up in the sinuses. This causes long-term swelling (called chronic rhinosinusitis) and growths in the nose called nasal polyps.'\n\n2. **Use more direct, active verbs instead of noun phrases.** The text often uses abstract nouns instead of simple verbs, a pattern called nominalization. This makes sentences less direct.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** '...surgery may be necessary to open up the sinuses and allow medical treatment to work properly.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** '...doctors may suggest surgery to open the sinuses so that medicines can work better.'\n\n3. **Break down long, complex sentences into shorter ones.** One key sentence is over 45 words long and contains too many ideas, making it difficult to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** 'Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least a year to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis, symptoms, and important outcomes like mortality, and consider the impact of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Future studies should be larger and follow people for at least a year. This will help us learn the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyps and symptoms. Researchers should also track important outcomes like survival and consider how new CF treatments might affect the results.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to many typical patterns, with 61% of features in the best quartile for readability (e.g., sentence length, active voice). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics are in the P90 range (higher than 90% of typical PLS texts): nominalization (noun-heavy phrases), SMOG index (readability), and two measures of complex words. This indicates that while the structure is good, the word choice and sentence construction are too technical for a lay audience."
