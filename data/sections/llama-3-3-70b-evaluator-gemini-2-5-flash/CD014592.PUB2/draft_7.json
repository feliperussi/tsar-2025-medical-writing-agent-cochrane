  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause?\nWe looked at the evidence to see if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We found that it may help, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure.\nUsing a type of hormone therapy called topical oestrogen with a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, or with surgery, may have some benefits. These benefits include fewer vaginal problems, like irritation or soreness, and fewer urinary tract infections after surgery. However, we are not confident in these results because the studies were designed differently, making them hard to compare.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum slips out of place into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, and surgery, we need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Hormone replacement therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We also wanted to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine if hormone replacement therapy is cost-effective for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. We looked for robust studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a dummy treatment in women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause. The studies assessed how hormone replacement therapy affects pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared hormone replacement therapy used with devices inserted into the vagina or surgery to using these devices or having surgery alone. We found that hormone replacement therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. Using topical oestrogen with a support device, such as a pessary, may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and using it with surgery may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies were designed differently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Using topical oestrogen with a support device or surgery may have some benefits, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- We need more research to fully understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too formal and uses complex noun phrases where simpler verbs would be clearer. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make the summary more direct and easier to read.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace complex, noun-heavy phrases with simpler, verb-focused sentences.**\nSome sentences are difficult to read because they are built around abstract nouns instead of direct actions. This makes the text feel dense and academic.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"We also wanted to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine if hormone replacement therapy is cost-effective for pelvic organ prolapse.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is packed with complex nouns like \"findings\", \"evaluations\", and \"determination\". It's indirect and hard to process quickly.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy is a good value for the money (cost-effective).\"\n\n**2. Define and use technical terms consistently.**\nThe summary repeatedly uses a long, descriptive phrase for a medical device instead of defining the technical term and using it. This makes the text repetitive and wordy.\n\n*   **Problematic phrase:** \"...devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrase appears multiple times. It's more effective to name the device, define it simply, and then use the name.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** In the \"What is pelvic organ prolapse?\" section, introduce the term: \"...treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, devices inserted into the vagina to support the organs (called pessaries), and surgery...\". Then, in the results, you can simply write: \"Using topical oestrogen with a support device (a pessary)...\".\n\n**3. Simplify wordy phrases and improve conciseness.**\nSome sentences could be more direct and use more common language to express the same idea, making them easier for readers to understand.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"significantly impact... quality of life\" is common in research but is jargon to many readers. It's better to describe the effect in simple terms.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can cause discomfort and make daily activities difficult.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and active voice are good (in the best quartile), there are significant deviations in vocabulary. Six metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, long words, and nominalizations, are in the P90 range or beyond. This indicates the text uses more complex vocabulary, long words, and noun-heavy phrases than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which supports the recommendation to simplify language and reduce nominalizations."
