  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause?\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women are unclear, with no reported harmful effects found in the available studies.\n- Topical oestrogen (a type of hormone therapy) in conjunction with pessaries (a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus) or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- Future research in this area should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy, used alone or in conjunction with other treatments, for the management of pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for POP include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. POP can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse?\nPOP is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, and surgery, there is a need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Oestrogen therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. They also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for POP.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two trials registers, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, multi-arm RCTs, and cross-over RCTs that evaluated the effects of oestrogen therapy (alone or in combination with other treatments) versus placebo, no treatment, or other interventions in postmenopausal women with any grade of POP.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nThe review found that oestrogen therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid conclusions. Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events, and topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may reduce postoperative urinary tract infections. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by several factors: potential performance bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start and all the necessary information is here. However, the summary is not yet ready for publication because the language is too academic and complex for a general audience. The main issues are the frequent use of abstract nouns instead of active verbs (nominalization), overly long and complex sentences, and an inconsistent use of 'we' to refer to the review authors. Addressing these three areas will significantly improve clarity and make the summary much easier for patients to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.** Many sentences are long and filled with abstract nouns, making them difficult to follow. This is a key barrier to readability.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research in this area should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy, used alone or in conjunction with other treatments, for the management of pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This 46-word sentence is dense with abstract concepts like 'effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness', 'conjunction', and 'management'. It's hard for a lay reader to process.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should be larger. They need to find out if hormone therapy is effective and good value for money when used alone or with other treatments for pelvic organ prolapse after menopause.\"\n\n2. **Use \"we\" consistently to refer to the review authors.** The summary starts by referring to \"the review authors\" in the third person and then switches to \"we\". This can be confusing for the reader. The style guide requires using \"we\" throughout.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It creates a formal, distant tone. Later sections use \"we\" (e.g., \"What did we find?\"), making the perspective inconsistent.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the benefits and harms...\"\n\n3. **Replace formal phrases with simpler, everyday language.** The text often uses formal, multi-word phrases where a single, simpler word would be clearer.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Topical oestrogen (a type of hormone therapy) in conjunction with pessaries...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"In conjunction with\" is jargon. Simpler words like \"with\" or \"alongside\" are better for a plain language summary.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Using topical oestrogen (a type of hormone therapy) with pessaries...\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While the word count is within limits, the summary deviates significantly in key areas of language complexity. Five metrics are 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. Specifically, the high scores for 'nominalization' (29 vs. a median of <13), 'complex_words' (143 vs. <84), 'nouns' (209 vs. <116), and the 'smog_index' (15 vs. <12.1) confirm that the vocabulary is too academic and noun-heavy, which makes the text difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
