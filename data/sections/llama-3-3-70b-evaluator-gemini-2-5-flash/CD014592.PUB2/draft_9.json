  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause? We looked at the evidence to see if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We found that it may help, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse? Pelvic organ prolapse is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum slips out of place into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse? Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, and surgery, we need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Hormone replacement therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We also wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy is a good value for the money.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? We searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. We looked for robust studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a dummy treatment in women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review? We found 14 studies that involved 1002 women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause. The studies assessed how hormone replacement therapy affects pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared hormone replacement therapy used with devices inserted into the vagina or surgery to using these devices or having surgery alone. We found that hormone replacement therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. Using topical oestrogen with a support device, such as a pessary, may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and using it with surgery may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies were designed differently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? We have limited confidence in the evidence because of a few problems. For example, some studies were very small, did not report all their findings, or the women involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages: \n- We are not sure if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Using topical oestrogen with a support device or surgery may have some benefits, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- We need more research to fully understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. However, the text is being marked as NOT_APPROVED to address a key area of improvement: the language is often noun-heavy and less direct than it could be, which can make it harder for readers to process. By revising a few key sentences to use more active verbs, you can make the summary significantly more engaging and easier to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The summary relies heavily on noun forms of verbs (known as 'nominalizations'), making sentences feel dense and less direct.\n   - **Quote:** \"We need more research to fully understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse...\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is packed with abstract nouns ('research', 'effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness', 'management'). This style is common in technical writing but can be a barrier for a lay audience.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase using verbs to describe the actions. For example: \"We need more research to find out how well hormone replacement therapy works and ...\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex descriptions.** Some descriptions are technically accurate but long and could be simplified for easier reading.\n   - **Quote:** \"...devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus...\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a long, clinical description for a device that is named later in the text ('pessary'). It's better to introduce the common name and its function together upfront.\n   - **Suggestion:** Introduce the plain-language term earlier. For example: \"...special devices (called pessaries) that are placed in the vagina for support...\"\n\n3. **Use more direct and active phrasing.** Some sentences use formal, passive-like phrasing that can be made more direct and personal by using 'we'.\n   - **Quote:** \"However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies were designed differently.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"should be interpreted with caution\" is impersonal and less direct than the active voice recommended in the style guide.\n   - **Suggestion:** Take ownership of the interpretation. For example: \"However, we are cautious about these findings because the studies were designed differently.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns for sentence length (P25) and active voice (P75). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nominalization' (BEYOND_P90), 'nouns' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90) are all higher than typical. This pattern indicates that while sentences are short, the word choices make the text dense and less action-oriented than it could be."
