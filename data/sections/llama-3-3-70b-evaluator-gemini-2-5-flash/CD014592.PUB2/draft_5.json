  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause? \nWe found that hormone replacement therapy may help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid conclusions. \nUsing topical oestrogen (a type of hormone therapy) with pessaries (a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus) or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer vaginal problems (like irritation or soreness) and fewer urinary tract infections after surgery. \nHowever, we are not confident in these results because the studies were all designed in different ways, making them difficult to compare.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse? \nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman’s uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. \nIt affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. \nRisk factors for POP include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. \nPOP can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse? \nPOP is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman’s quality of life. \nWhile there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, and surgery, there is a need to find the most effective and safe treatments. \nOestrogen therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. \nWe also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for POP.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? \nWe searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. \nWe looked for robust studies (called randomised controlled trials) that compared oestrogen therapy against other treatments, no treatment, or a placebo (dummy treatment) in postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review? \nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. \nThe studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. \nMost studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone. \nWe found that oestrogen therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid conclusions. \nTopical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events, and topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may reduce postoperative urinary tract infections. \nHowever, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited by several factors: potential performance bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women are unclear, with no reported harmful effects found in the available studies.\n- Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- Future research in this area should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy, used alone or in conjunction with other treatments, for the management of pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, the language is often too technical and complex for a lay audience, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis. To improve clarity and readability for patients, please focus on the following three areas:\n\n1. **Simplify Complex and Technical Phrasing.** The summary contains many words and phrases that are not in plain language, making key sentences difficult to understand.\n   - **Example:** \"Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events, and topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may reduce postoperative urinary tract infections.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'in conjunction with', 'associated with', 'adverse vaginal events', and 'postoperative' are clinical terms. Readers may not understand them.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Using topical oestrogen *with* pessaries may lead to fewer vaginal problems (like irritation or soreness). Using it *with* surgery may reduce urinary tract infections *after* the operation.\"\n\n2. **Use Active Verbs Instead of Nouns (Reduce Nominalization).** Several sentences rely on abstract nouns instead of direct action verbs. This makes the text denser and less engaging.\n   - **Example:** \"...for the management of pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Using the noun 'management' is less direct than using the verb 'manage'.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...to manage pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\"\n   - **Another Example:** \"Future research in this area should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In the future, researchers should conduct larger studies to assess if hormone replacement therapy is effective and cost-effective...\"\n\n3. **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice.** The draft uses passive voice in several places, which can make it unclear who is performing the action. The style guide requires active voice.\n   - **Example:** \"The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is less direct than stating who did the action.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Researchers conducted these studies to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The summary shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some readability scores are within the median range, there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure that make the text too complex for a lay audience. Six key metrics—for complex words, long words, noun count, and nominalizations—are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text is much denser than a typical PLS. The SMOG index of 15.3 suggests a university-level reading ability is required. Additionally, the use of passive voice is higher than is typical for this text type."
