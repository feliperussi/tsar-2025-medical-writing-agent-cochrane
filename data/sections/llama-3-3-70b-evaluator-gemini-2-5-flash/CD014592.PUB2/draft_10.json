  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause? We looked at the evidence to see if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We found that it may help, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse? Pelvic organ prolapse is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum slips out of place into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse? Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, special devices (called pessaries) that are placed in the vagina for support, and surgery, we need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Hormone replacement therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We also wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy is a good value for the money.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? We searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. We looked for robust studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a dummy treatment in women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review? We found 14 studies that involved 1002 women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause. The studies assessed how hormone replacement therapy affects pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared hormone replacement therapy used with devices inserted into the vagina or surgery to using these devices or having surgery alone. We found that hormone replacement therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. Using topical oestrogen with a support device, such as a pessary, may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and using it with surgery may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation. However, we are cautious about these findings because the studies were designed differently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? We have limited confidence in the evidence because of a few problems. For example, some studies were very small, did not report all their findings, or the women involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages: \n- We are not sure if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Using topical oestrogen with a support device or surgery may have some benefits, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- We need more research to find out how well hormone replacement therapy works and if it is a good value for the money for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are a repetitive opening, some unclear terminology, and a few long, noun-heavy sentences that can be simplified. The feedback below focuses on the top 3 improvements to make the summary more direct and easier to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Make the opening more direct and engaging.**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The first two sentences say the same thing, which can feel repetitive to the reader.\n*   **Original Text:** \"Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause? We looked at the evidence to see if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Combine these into a single, clear opening statement. This gets straight to the point.\n*   **Rewrite:** \"In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause.\"\n\n**2. Clarify what makes a study 'robust'.**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The terms \"robust studies\" and \"dummy treatment\" are vague or jargon-like for a patient audience. Explaining *why* a study is high-quality helps build trust and understanding.\n*   **Original Text:** \"We looked for robust studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a dummy treatment...\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Briefly explain what kind of studies you looked for and use the standard term 'placebo' with a simple definition.\n*   **Rewrite:** \"We searched for high-quality studies called 'randomised controlled trials'. In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance, which is the best way to compare treatments. We looked for studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a placebo (a dummy treatment).\"\n\n**3. Break up long sentences to make key findings clearer.**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The main finding is presented in a long, 34-word sentence that combines two separate results. This makes it difficult to absorb the information.\n*   **Original Text:** \"Using topical oestrogen with a support device, such as a pessary, may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and using it with surgery may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Split this into two shorter, more active sentences. This makes each finding distinct and easier to remember.\n*   **Rewrite:** \"For women using a support device (a pessary), adding topical oestrogen may lead to fewer vaginal problems. For women having surgery, adding topical oestrogen may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation.\"\n\nThis change will also help address the high number of noun-based phrases ('nominalizations') identified in the linguistic analysis, making the text more active and direct.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in three key areas related to vocabulary and style: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-forms of verbs) is rated 'Beyond PLS', and the counts for total 'nouns' and 'complex_words_dc' (uncommon words) are in the P90 range. This suggests the text is more noun-heavy and uses less common vocabulary than a typical PLS, which can affect readability and was a factor in the suggested improvements."
