  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause?\nWe looked at the evidence to see if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We found that it may help, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure.\nUsing a type of hormone therapy called topical oestrogen with a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, or with surgery, may have some benefits. These benefits include fewer vaginal problems, like irritation or soreness, and fewer urinary tract infections after surgery. However, we are not confident in these results because the studies were designed differently, making them hard to compare.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum slips out of place into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, and surgery, we need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Hormone replacement therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We also wanted to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine if hormone replacement therapy is cost-effective for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. We looked for robust studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a dummy treatment in women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of hormone replacement therapy on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared hormone replacement therapy used with devices inserted into the vagina or surgery to using these devices or having surgery alone. We found that hormone replacement therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. Using topical oestrogen with devices inserted into the vagina may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and using it with surgery may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies were designed differently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Using topical oestrogen with devices inserted into the vagina or surgery may have some benefits, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- We need more research to fully understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause.",

However, it is NOT_APPROVED because several style issues affect readability for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\\n\\n1. **Use more direct verbs and active voice.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs ('nominalizations') and passive voice, which makes sentences dense and less direct. The analysis confirms this, with `nominalization` rated 'BEYOND_P90'.\\n    *   **Example:** 'The studies were conducted to assess the effects of hormone replacement therapy on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'The studies assessed how hormone replacement therapy affects pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.'\\n\\n2. **Simplify complex and formal language.** The summary uses words that are more complex than necessary, making it harder to read. Metrics for complex words (`complex_words`), long words (`long_words`), and the SMOG readability index are all high (in the P90 range).\\n    *   **Example:** 'However, these findings should be interpreted with caution...'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'However, we are not confident in these results...' (which you used effectively in the first paragraph).\\n\\n3. **Simplify the repeated description of the vaginal device.** The phrase 'devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus' is accurate but long and clunky when repeated.\\n    *   **Example:** 'Using topical oestrogen with devices inserted into the vagina...'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** The first time, explain it as 'a device inserted into the vagina to provide support (called a pessary)'. For later mentions, you can simply use 'with a support device' or 'with a pessary'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and most readability scores are within the typical median range, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Six key metrics are in the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. The most significant issue is `nominalization` (BEYOND_P90), supported by a high `nouns` count (P90). Additionally, metrics for vocabulary complexity (`smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, `long_words`) are all in the P90 range, suggesting the text is more difficult to read than a typical PLS."
