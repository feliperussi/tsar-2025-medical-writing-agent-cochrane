  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause? We looked at the evidence to see if hormone replacement therapy can help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We found that it may help, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. Using a type of hormone therapy called topical oestrogen with a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, or with surgery, may have some benefits. These benefits include fewer vaginal problems, like irritation or soreness, and fewer urinary tract infections after surgery. However, we are not confident in these results because the studies were designed differently, making them hard to compare.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse? Pelvic organ prolapse is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum slips out of place into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse? Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, devices inserted into the vagina to support the uterus (called pessaries), and surgery, we need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Hormone replacement therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause. We also wanted to find out if hormone replacement therapy is a good value for the money.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? We searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. We looked for robust studies that compared hormone replacement therapy to other treatments, no treatment, or a dummy treatment in women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review? We found 14 studies that involved 1002 women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause. The studies assessed how hormone replacement therapy affects pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared hormone replacement therapy used with devices inserted into the vagina or surgery to using these devices or having surgery alone. We found that hormone replacement therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. Using topical oestrogen with a support device, such as a pessary, may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and using it with surgery may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies were designed differently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages: \n- We are not sure if hormone replacement therapy can help manage pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in women after menopause because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Using topical oestrogen with a support device or surgery may have some benefits, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- We need more research to fully understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary needs to be clearer and more direct for a patient audience. The main issues are the use of abstract, noun-heavy language and some overly complex sentences. While factually accurate, these issues make the text feel more academic than a Plain Language Summary should. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with more direct phrasing.** The text often uses formal, noun-based phrases where simpler verbs would be easier to understand. This makes the summary less engaging and harder to read.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a list of abstract concepts ('bias', 'reporting', 'applicability') that are difficult for a lay reader to quickly grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence because of a few problems. For example, some studies were very small, did not report all their findings, or the women involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex technical descriptions.** Some sentences pack in too many technical ideas at once, which can overwhelm the reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Using a type of hormone therapy called topical oestrogen with a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus, or with surgery, may have some benefits.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence introduces three distinct concepts (topical oestrogen, a support device, and surgery) in a complex structure.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"One type of hormone therapy, a cream or gel called topical oestrogen, may have some benefits when used with other treatments. For example, using it with a support device in the vagina (a pessary) or with surgery may help reduce problems like vaginal irritation or infections after surgery.\"\n\n3. **Use more active and direct language.** Some sentences use a passive or formal tone that creates distance from the reader. Using a more active voice makes the text clearer.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies were designed differently.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"should be interpreted with caution\" is passive and indirect. It's clearer to state who should be cautious and why.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, we are not confident in these results because the studies were designed in very different ways, making them hard to compare.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and use of pronouns are good, the draft's vocabulary is significantly more complex and abstract than is typical for a PLS. Six metrics fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, most notably 'nominalization' (use of noun-form verbs), 'complex_words', 'long_words', and the 'smog_index' readability score. This confirms that the text relies too heavily on complex, noun-based language, which reduces clarity for a lay audience."
