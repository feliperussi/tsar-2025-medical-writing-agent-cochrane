  "draft": "# Can hormone replacement therapy (hormones to treat symptoms caused by low estrogen levels) help women with pelvic organ prolapse (when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips out of place) after menopause?\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women are unclear, with no reported harmful effects found in the available studies.\n- Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections, but these findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- Future research in this area should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy, used alone or in conjunction with other treatments, for the management of pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\n**Introduction**\n## What is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for POP include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. POP can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n## Why is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse?\nPOP is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, and surgery, there is a need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Oestrogen therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. They also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for POP.\n**Methods**\n## Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) from inception to the present, using keywords and MeSH terms related to \"estrogen therapy\" and \"pelvic organ prolapse\". No language restrictions were applied.\n## Eligibility Criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑experimental studies, and observational cohort studies that evaluated the effect of systemic or local estrogen therapy on pelvic organ prolapse outcomes in adult women. Studies without a comparator group or without relevant outcome data were excluded.\n## Study Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus. Data extracted included study design, participant characteristics, estrogen regimen, duration of treatment, prolapse stage, outcome measures (e.g., POP‑Q scores, symptom questionnaires) and adverse events.\n## Risk of Bias Assessment\nRisk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Domains evaluated included randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and confounding.\n## Confidence in the Evidence\nOverall confidence in the body of evidence was graded with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone. The population characteristics included postmenopausal women with any grade of pelvic organ prolapse, but the specific age range and severity of condition were not reported. The study settings and funding sources were not explicitly stated in the abstract. No studies assessed the effects of oestrogen therapy alone versus no treatment, placebo, pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, or surgery. The duration of the studies was not reported.\n## Main results: Effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse\nThe review found that oestrogen therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid conclusions. Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events, and topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may reduce postoperative urinary tract infections. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies. More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by several factors: (1) potential performance bias because participants may have known which treatment they received; (2) incomplete reporting, as many studies did not provide data for all outcomes of interest; (3) very small sample sizes, reducing statistical power and precision; and (4) limited applicability, since the studies do not cover the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes that are relevant.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
