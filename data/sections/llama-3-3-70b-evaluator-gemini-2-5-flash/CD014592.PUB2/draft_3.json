  "draft": "Can hormone replacement therapy help women with pelvic organ prolapse after menopause?\n- We found that hormone replacement therapy may help with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid conclusions. \n- Using topical oestrogen (a type of hormone therapy) with pessaries (a device inserted into the vagina to support the uterus) or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections. \n- However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for POP include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight. POP can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for pelvic organ prolapse?\nPOP is a common problem that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. While there are some treatments available, such as pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, and surgery, there is a need to find the most effective and safe treatments. Oestrogen therapy is one potential treatment option that has been studied.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. We also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for POP.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two trials registers, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, multi-arm RCTs, and cross-over RCTs that evaluated the effects of oestrogen therapy (alone or in combination with other treatments) versus placebo, no treatment, or other interventions in postmenopausal women with any grade of POP.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nThe review found that oestrogen therapy may reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any solid conclusions. Topical oestrogen with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events, and topical oestrogen with surgery may reduce postoperative urinary tract infections. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by several factors: potential performance bias because participants may have known which treatment they received, incomplete reporting, very small sample sizes, and limited applicability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of overly technical language copied from the abstract, particularly in the methods section, and the use of academic, noun-heavy phrasing that makes the text feel dense and difficult to read. By simplifying these areas, the summary can become much more accessible.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify the technical methods sections.**\nThe sections explaining how studies were found and chosen are copied directly from the technical abstract and contain jargon that is meaningless to a lay reader.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two trials registers, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings... We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, multi-arm RCTs, and cross-over RCTs...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Patients don't know what these databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE) or study types (quasi-RCTs) are. This level of detail is unnecessary and intimidating.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine and simplify these sections into one clear paragraph. For example: \"How did we find the evidence? We searched major medical research databases for studies up to June 2022. We looked for robust studies (called randomised controlled trials) that compared oestrogen therapy against other treatments, no treatment, or a placebo (dummy treatment) in postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse.\"\n\n**2. Replace academic phrasing with more direct language.**\nThe summary uses several noun-heavy, academic phrases that can be simplified by using active verbs.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is passive and abstract. It tells the reader to be cautious but doesn't clearly explain why. Using a direct verb makes the reason clearer.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"However, we are not confident in these results because the studies were all designed in different ways, making them difficult to compare.\"\n\n**3. Define or replace medical jargon.**\nSome medical terms are used without a clear, simple explanation for a patient audience.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Adverse events\" and \"postoperative\" are clinical terms. While a reader might guess their meaning, using everyday language is always better.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...fewer vaginal problems (like irritation or soreness) and fewer urinary tract infections after surgery.\"\n\nBy addressing these key areas, the summary will be much clearer and more helpful for women and their families seeking to understand their treatment options.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and readability scores are within the median range, the draft deviates significantly in areas related to vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics are in the P90 range (higher than 90% of typical PLS texts), including `complex_words` (130), `long_words` (188), `nominalization` (23), and the `smog_index` (14.45). This pattern strongly suggests the text uses too many multi-syllable words, technical terms, and noun-based phrases, which supports the editorial recommendation to simplify vocabulary and sentence structures."
