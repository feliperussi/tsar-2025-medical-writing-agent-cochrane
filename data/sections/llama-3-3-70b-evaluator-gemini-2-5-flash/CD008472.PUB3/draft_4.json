  "draft": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey Messages\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning may lead to little or no difference in complications such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of remote ischaemic preconditioning are unclear.\n- We need more and larger studies to be certain about the effects of this technique. Future research should focus on results that matter most to patients, like their quality of life and recovery time.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked and then restored. This process has been shown to protect other parts of the body from damage caused by a lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery carries a significant risk of complications, including death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke. RIPC has the potential to reduce these risks by protecting the body's tissues from damage.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nWe wanted to find out whether RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke, in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. We also wanted to assess the safety of RIPC and whether it has any unwanted effects. We aimed to compare the outcomes of people who received RIPC with those who did not receive RIPC, in order to determine the benefits and harms of this technique.\n\nMethods\nWhat was the search strategy for this review?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies comparing RIPC with no RIPC in patients undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\nWhat were the eligibility criteria for the studies included in this review?\nWe included studies where researchers randomly put adults having planned surgery into different groups to compare treatments. These studies were randomized controlled trials, which are considered to provide the most reliable evidence.\nHow were the data extracted and synthesized?\nWe looked at what the studies measured, such as deaths during or soon after surgery, heart attacks, and kidney problems. We also looked at how long people stayed in the hospital. We used a method called GRADE to judge how certain we could be about the evidence for each of these results.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. The included studies compared RIPC with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has several limitations. The studies included very few participants. There were also differences in the types of people studied and how the treatment was given. Finally, only a small number of studies were included, which might overestimate the treatment's benefits.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and reduce complexity before it can be approved. The language, particularly in the Methods and Aims sections, is too technical and contains jargon that would be unfamiliar to a lay audience. The draft also relies too heavily on passive voice and wordy phrasing, making it harder to read than necessary. Addressing the 3 key areas below will significantly improve readability for patients and their families.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify the Methods Section and Remove Jargon:** The subheadings and descriptions in the Methods section use technical terms that are not explained in simple language.\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"What were the eligibility criteria for the studies included in this review? We included studies where researchers randomly put adults having planned surgery into different groups to compare treatments. These studies were randomized controlled trials, which are considered to provide the most reliable evidence.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"eligibility criteria\" and \"randomized controlled trials\" are jargon. The explanation is a bit clunky and uses passive voice (\"are considered\").\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Change the subheading to \"What studies did we look for?\" and the text to: \"We looked for studies that randomly assigned adults having planned surgery to either receive RIPC or no treatment. This type of study, called a randomised controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence.\"\n\n**2. Make the Aims Section More Concise:** The section explaining the review's goals is repetitive.\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"We wanted to find out whether RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications... We also wanted to assess the safety of RIPC and whether it has any unwanted effects. We aimed to compare the outcomes of people who received RIPC with those who did not receive RIPC, in order to determine the benefits and harms of this technique.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This states the same goal three times using different words (\"is it effective\", \"assess safety\", \"determine benefits and harms\"), which can be tedious for the reader.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if RIPC reduces the risk of complications (like death, heart attack, or stroke) for people having major vascular surgery. We also looked for any unwanted effects to understand the overall benefits and harms of the technique.\"\n\n**3. Reduce Passive Voice and Wordiness:** Several sentences use passive voice, which can make the text feel less direct and harder to follow.\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is passive. The active voice is more direct and engaging, as recommended by the style guide.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Researchers conducted these studies between 2003 and 2019.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour draft shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. The issues identified above are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found the text has a high number of passive voice constructions (20), complex words (130), and long words (179) compared to a typical PLS. Implementing these suggestions will help bring those metrics closer to the target range and make the summary much easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there is significant deviation in six key areas. The draft has high rates of passive voice, nouns, complex words (both general and Dale-Chall), and long words, all falling in the P90 range. This indicates that the vocabulary is more complex and the sentence structures are less direct than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need for simplification and conversion to active voice."
