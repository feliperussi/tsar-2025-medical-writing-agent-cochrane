  "draft": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey Messages\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning may lead to little or no difference in complications such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of remote ischaemic preconditioning are unclear.\n- Future research in this area should focus on key limitations, such as the need for adequately powered and designed randomised studies that investigate clinical endpoints and patient-centred outcomes.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked and then restored. This process has been shown to protect other parts of the body from damage caused by a lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery carries a significant risk of complications, including death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke. RIPC has the potential to reduce these risks by protecting the body's tissues from damage.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nWe wanted to find out whether RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke, in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. We also wanted to assess the safety of RIPC and whether it has any unwanted effects. We aimed to compare the outcomes of people who received RIPC with those who did not receive RIPC, in order to determine the benefits and harms of this technique.\n\nMethods\nWhat was the search strategy for this review?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies comparing RIPC with no RIPC in patients undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\nWhat were the eligibility criteria for the studies included in this review?\nWe included studies that were randomized controlled trials, where adults having planned surgery were randomly put into groups to compare treatments. Two of our authors worked separately to pull out important information from these studies. They also checked the studies for any weaknesses in their methods.\nHow were the data extracted and synthesized?\nWe collected data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality, and the remote ischaemic preconditioning stimulus used. Our primary outcome was perioperative mortality, and secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, hospital stay, limb loss, and operating time or total anaesthetic time. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. The included studies compared RIPC with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. RIPC probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has several limitations. The studies included very few participants. There were also differences in the types of people studied and how the treatment was given. Finally, only a small number of studies were included, which might overestimate the treatment's benefits.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It is well-output structured, factually accurate, and meets the word count requirements. However, several sections, particularly in the \"Methods\" and \"Key Messages\", use technical language taken directly from the original abstract, which will be difficult for a lay audience to understand. To improve clarity for patients, please focus on the following 3 areas:\n\n1. **Simplify the description of the study methods.** The current text contains significant jargon that is not explained.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Our primary outcome was perioperative mortality, and secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, hospital stay, limb loss, and operating time or total anaesthetic time. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'primary outcome', 'perioperative mortality', 'myocardial infarction', 'renal impairment', and 'GRADE approach' are unfamiliar to most readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We looked at what the studies measured, such as deaths during or soon after surgery, heart attacks, and kidney problems. We also looked at how long people stayed in the hospital. We used a method called GRADE to judge how certain we could be about the evidence for each of these results.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the message about future research.** The recommendation for future research is too technical and doesn't explain why it matters to patients.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Future research in this area should focus on key limitations, such as the need for adequately powered and designed randomised studies that investigate clinical endpoints and patient-centred outcomes.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'adequately powered', 'clinical endpoints', and 'patient-centred outcomes' are research jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We need more and larger studies to be certain about the effects of this technique. Future research should focus on results that matter most to patients, like their quality of life and recovery time.\"\n\n3. **Use active voice to make the text more direct.** Some sentences use passive voice, which can make them less clear and engaging.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...where adults having planned surgery were randomly put into groups to compare treatments.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is passive and a bit clunky. The active voice is more direct and easier to follow, as recommended by the style guide.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We included studies where researchers randomly put adults having planned surgery into different groups to compare treatments.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help address the high vocabulary complexity scores noted in the evaluation and make the summary much more accessible for your target audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length, pronoun use, and active voice count are good (in the best quartile), the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Key metrics like the SMOG index and complex word count are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the language is too technical for a lay audience. The high number of passive voice constructions (90th percentile) also contributes to sections that are less direct and clear than they could be."
