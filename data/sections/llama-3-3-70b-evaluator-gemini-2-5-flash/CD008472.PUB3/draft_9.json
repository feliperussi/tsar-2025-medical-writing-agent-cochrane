  "draft": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey messages:\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) probably leads to little or no difference in reducing complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke, during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- The evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain about these results. The small number of people included in the studies means the findings could be due to chance. More research is needed to provide a clearer answer.\n- Future studies should investigate remote ischaemic preconditioning further, focusing on its effects on patients and including more people to give more reliable results.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where the blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked. This can help protect other parts of the body, like the heart, from damage caused by a lack of blood flow during surgery. People undergoing major vascular surgery are at risk of serious complications like heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes. RIPC has the potential to reduce this risk by making the body's tissues more resilient to periods of low blood flow.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe authors of this review wanted to determine whether using RIPC in people having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery would reduce the risk of complications, such as death, heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes, compared to not using RIPC. They also aimed to find out if RIPC would lead to shorter hospital stays or shorter operating times.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. Also, the studies differed in the types of patients they included and how they performed the preconditioning technique. This makes it hard to combine their results confidently.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a very well-structured draft that meets nearly all the criteria for a high-quality Plain Language Summary. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few content adjustments are needed to ensure patients fully understand the limitations of the evidence before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Strengthen the 'Limitations of the evidence' section.** The current version omits a key limitation mentioned in the source material about the potential for bias. This is important context for readers to understand why the evidence is uncertain.\n   * **Problem:** 'Our confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. Also, the studies differed in the types of patients they included and how they performed the preconditioning technique.'\n   * **Suggestion:** Please add the missing information about potential bias. For example: 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited. The studies included only a small number of people, and they differed in how they performed the technique. **It is also possible that studies finding a benefit were more likely to be published, which could affect the overall results.**'\n\n2. **Make the terminology for the surgery consistent.** The summary uses several different phrases ('vascular surgery', 'major vascular surgery', 'major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures'). This could confuse a reader. Using one consistent term is clearer.\n   * **Problem:** The text alternates between different terms, for example in the subheading: '...why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?'\n   * **Suggestion:** Please use the full, consistent term throughout the summary. For example, change the subheading to: 'What is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery?'\n\n3. **Clarify the uncertainty in the second key message.** The current wording is good, but could more directly state why the evidence is not strong enough, as reflected in the source text.\n   * **Problem:** 'The evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain about these results. The small number of people included in the studies means the findings could be due to chance.'\n   * **Suggestion:** Consider a rewrite that is more direct, like the one from the source material: 'The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer. The results could be due to chance because of the small number of people in the studies, and more research is needed.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 89% of metrics, including sentence length (17.66 words), passive voice (8 instances), and all readability scores, fall within the best quartile for plain language summaries. This indicates a strong foundation of clear, simple sentences and appropriate vocabulary. The feedback focuses on content clarity and consistency rather than structural issues."
