  "draft": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery, effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey Messages\n- RIPC may lead to little or no difference in complications such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of RIPC are unclear.\n- Future research in this area should focus on key limitations, such as the need for adequately powered and designed randomised studies that investigate clinical endpoints and patient-centred outcomes.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked and then restored. This process has been shown to protect other parts of the body from damage caused by a lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery carries a significant risk of complications, including death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke. RIPC has the potential to reduce these risks by protecting the body's tissues from damage.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke, in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. They also wanted to assess the safety of RIPC and whether it has any unwanted effects. The authors aimed to compare the outcomes of people who received RIPC with those who did not receive RIPC, in order to determine the benefits and harms of this technique.\n\nMethods\nWhat was the search strategy for this review?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies comparing RIPC with no RIPC in patients undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\nWhat were the eligibility criteria for the studies included in this review?\nIncluded studies were randomized controlled trials involving adult participants undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular procedures, comparing RIPC with a control condition.\nHow were the data extracted and synthesized?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias, and summarized the results. We assessed confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. The included studies compared RIPC with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. RIPC probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has several limitations. The studies included very few participants. There were also differences in the types of people studied and how the treatment was given. Finally, only a small number of studies were included, which might make the benefits of the treatment seem greater than they actually are.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience, particularly in the Methods section. The language is often too technical and uses passive voice, which can make it difficult to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the Methods section and remove jargon.** The Methods section currently reads like it's for a technical audience. Phrases like \"randomized controlled trials,\" \"extracted data,\" and \"risk of bias\" are unclear to most patients.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Included studies were randomized controlled trials involving adult participants... Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We looked for studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where adults having planned surgery were randomly put into groups to compare treatments. Two of our authors worked separately to pull out important information from these studies. They also checked the studies for any weaknesses in their methods (known as 'risk of bias').\"\n\n2. **Use active voice instead of passive voice.** The draft frequently uses passive constructions, which can make the text feel distant and less direct. The style guide recommends using the active voice (e.g., \"We found...\" instead of \"It was found...\").\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Included studies were randomized controlled trials...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We included studies that were randomized controlled trials...\"\n\n3. **Make the Limitations section more direct.** The explanation of one key limitation is wordy and could be stated more simply.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...which might make the benefits of the treatment seem greater than they actually are.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...which might overestimate the treatment's benefits.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and active voice count are good (P25 and P75 respectively), there are significant deviations in six key areas that impact readability. The draft scores in the P90 range for passive voice, noun count, and multiple vocabulary complexity metrics (SMOG index, complex words, long words). This indicates the text is more passive and uses more complex, technical vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need for the recommended edits."
