This process has been shown to protect other parts of the body from damage caused by a lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery carries a significant risk of complications, including death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke. RIPC has the potential to reduce these risks by protecting the body's tissues from damage.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke, in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. They also wanted to assess the safety of RIPC and whether it has any unwanted effects. The authors aimed to compare the outcomes of people who received RIPC with those who did not receive RIPC, in order to determine the benefits and harms of this technique.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n### Eligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies were randomized controlled trials involving adult participants undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular procedures, comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with a control condition.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias, and summarized the results. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. The included studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the study settings, such as the countries in which they took place, or the funding sources. The types of interventions and comparisons were RIPC versus no RIPC. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods, and the fact that only a small subset of available studies was included, which may lead to an over‑estimation of the intervention's benefits.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

Since the term is already defined in the title, this repetition makes the key message unnecessarily long and less concise, going against the Cochrane guideline for conciseness.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) may lead to little or no difference in complications such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\" (It is recommended to update the title to introduce RIPC: \"Is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery, effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\")\n\n2.  **Simplify Long and Complex Sentence in Limitations:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods, and the fact that only a small subset of available studies was included, which may lead to an over‑estimation of the intervention's benefits.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** This sentence is too long (37 words) and contains technical terms (\"heterogeneity,\" \"intervention delivery methods,\" \"over-estimation\") that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The linguistic analysis confirms a higher-than-typical average sentence length and complex vocabulary.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence has several limitations. The studies included very few participants. There were also differences in the types of people studied and how the treatment was given. Finally, only a small number of studies were included, which might make the benefits of the treatment seem greater than they actually are.\"\n\n3.  **Rephrase Noun-Heavy Sentence in Results:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The types of interventions and comparisons were RIPC versus no RIPC.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** This sentence is less direct and uses a noun-heavy construction, which can make the text less engaging and harder to follow. The linguistic analysis indicates a higher number of nouns than typical for PLS texts.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared RIPC with no RIPC.\"\n\n4.  **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice in Methods:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** This sentence uses passive voice, which obscures who performed the action and goes against the Master Style Guide's recommendation to use active voice. The linguistic analysis shows a higher-than-typical use of passive voice.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We assessed confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns in several key areas. While 61.1% of features are in the best quartile, 22.2% are in the P90 range, and 11.1% are beyond P90. Specifically, the text shows higher-than-typical average sentence length (words_per_sentence at P90, suggesting sentences are too long), a higher number of nouns (nouns at P90), and a significant number of complex and long words (smog_index BEYOND_P90, complex_words BEYOND_P90, complex_words_dc P90, long_words P90). The use of passive voice is also higher than typical (passive_voice at P75). These deviations collectively point to a text that is more difficult to read and less concise than ideal for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the editorial feedback provided."
