  "draft": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey messages:\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) probably leads to little or no difference in reducing complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke, during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer. The results could be due to chance because of the small number of people in the studies, and more research is needed.\n- Future studies should investigate remote ischaemic preconditioning further, focusing on its effects on patients and including more people to give more reliable results.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where the blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked. This can help protect other parts of the body, like the heart, from damage caused by a lack of blood flow during surgery. People undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery are at risk of serious complications like heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes. RIPC has the potential to reduce this risk by making the body's tissues more resilient to periods of low blood flow.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe authors of this review wanted to determine whether using RIPC in people having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery would reduce the risk of complications, such as death, heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes, compared to not using RIPC. They also aimed to find out if RIPC would lead to shorter hospital stays or shorter operating times.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. The studies included only a small number of people, and they differed in how they performed the technique. It is also possible that studies finding a benefit were more likely to be published, which could affect the overall results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. The linguistic metrics are also excellent. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity and conciseness for the reader before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the key message about evidence limitations.** The current wording is a bit vague and combines several ideas into one sentence.\n   - **Current text:** \"The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer. The results could be due to chance because of the small number of people in the studies, and more research is needed.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This doesn't fully explain *why* the evidence is limited. The abstract and source material also mention differences in how the technique was applied and potential publication bias.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited. This is because the studies included small numbers of people, used different methods for the preconditioning technique, and studies showing a benefit may have been more likely to be published.\"\n\n2. **Avoid repeating the definition of the main technical term.** The long definition is used in the title and first key message, then repeated in the background section. It's better to define it once clearly.\n   - **Current text:** The definition \"(a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked...)\" appears in both the title and the first key message.\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Repeating a long definition makes the key messages harder to scan and read quickly. The standard practice is to introduce the term and acronym, define it once in the body of the text, and then use the acronym.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** In the \"What is...\" section, write: \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where the blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked.\" Then, simplify the first key message to: \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) probably leads to little or no difference in reducing complications...\"\n\n3. **Improve conciseness and use a more direct, active voice.** Some sentences are longer and more formal than necessary.\n   - **Current text:** \"The authors of this review wanted to determine whether using RIPC in people having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery would reduce the risk of complications... compared to not using RIPC.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is wordy and uses the third person (\"The authors\"). The style guide recommends using \"we\" and being concise.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if RIPC reduces the risk of complications for people having major vascular or endovascular surgery.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the expected median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong readability and structural integrity. Notably, key metrics like words per sentence (19.69) and passive voice instances (7) are in the best quartile (P25), confirming the text is generally concise and uses an active voice. The suggested edits are therefore focused on refining clarity and style rather than correcting significant metric deviations."
