  "draft": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey messages:\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably leads to little or no difference in reducing complications such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning.\n- Future studies should investigate remote ischaemic preconditioning further, focusing on its effects on patients and including more people to give more reliable results.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked. This can help protect other parts of the body, like the heart, from damage caused by a lack of blood flow during surgery. People undergoing major vascular surgery are at risk of serious complications like heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes. RIPC has the potential to reduce this risk by making the body's tissues more resilient to periods of low blood flow.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe authors of this review wanted to determine whether using RIPC in people having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery would reduce the risk of complications, such as death, heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes, compared to not using RIPC. They also aimed to find out if RIPC would lead to shorter hospital stays or shorter operating times.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, and the likelihood of over-estimating benefits because only a small, possibly selective subset of studies was included in the review.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check because it is missing the required 'Methods' section, which explains how the review was conducted. Additionally, several sections use technical language that would be difficult for a lay audience to understand, particularly in the 'Limitations' section. The key messages could also be more direct and clear.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Methods' section.** A plain language summary must briefly explain how the authors found and analyzed the evidence. Without this, readers cannot understand the basis for the findings.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a new section with a heading like 'How did we conduct this review?' and include this content from the source material: \"We searched for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the technical language in the 'Limitations' section.** This section is copied directly from a technical source and contains jargon that is unclear to patients.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, and the likelihood of over-estimating benefits because only a small, possibly selective subset of studies was included in the review.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. Also, the studies differed in the types of patients they included and how they performed the preconditioning technique. This makes it hard to combine their results confidently.\"\n\n3. **Make the second key message more concrete.** The current wording is vague and doesn't clearly explain *why* the evidence is not strong.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain about these results. The small number of people included in the studies means the findings could be due to chance. More research is needed to provide a clearer answer.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges. However, several vocabulary complexity metrics, including 'complex_words' and 'smog_index', are in the P75 range. This indicates that the text is on the higher end of complexity for a PLS, which supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical terms, particularly in the 'Limitations' section, to improve readability for a lay audience."
