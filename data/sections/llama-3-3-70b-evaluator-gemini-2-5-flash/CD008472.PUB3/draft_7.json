  "draft": "# Is remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) probably leads to little or no difference in reducing complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke, during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures, and may have little effect on hospital stay or operating time.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer, and the results could be due to chance or other factors, highlighting the need for more research in this area to fully understand the potential benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning.\n- Future studies should investigate remote ischaemic preconditioning further, focusing on its effects on patients and including more people to give more reliable results, which would help doctors and patients make informed decisions about its use in surgery.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where the blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked. This can help protect other parts of the body, like the heart, from damage caused by a lack of blood flow during surgery. People undergoing major vascular surgery, which involves operations on the blood vessels, are at risk of serious complications like heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes. RIPC has the potential to reduce this risk by making the body's tissues more resilient to periods of low blood flow.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe authors of this review wanted to determine whether using RIPC in people having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery would reduce the risk of complications, such as death, heart attacks, kidney damage, and strokes, compared to not using RIPC. They also aimed to find out if RIPC would lead to shorter hospital stays or shorter operating times.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. The included studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, and the likelihood of over‑estimating benefits because only a small, possibly selective subset of studies was included in the review.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
