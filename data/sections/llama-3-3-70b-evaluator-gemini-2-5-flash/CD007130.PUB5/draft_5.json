  "draft": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\n- Both types of rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n- We need more research to determine the long-term effects of home-based and hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks (when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of blood flow) and strokes (when the brain is damaged due to a lack of blood flow).\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nWe define centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes as supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely) and are designed to be done at home with support from healthcare staff.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to find out how well these programs improved people's health and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only 3 studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction (heart attack), or revascularisation (a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart), or with heart failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies included were very small, and some did not report on all the results we were looking for. Also, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe found that both home-based and hospital-based rehabilitation seem to work equally well for people who have had a heart attack, a procedure to restore blood flow (revascularisation), or heart failure. Both approaches improved people's health and quality of life. However, we need more research to confirm these findings, especially for patients with specific conditions such as those who have had heart failure or valve surgery. Further research is also needed to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, and to explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of hybrid models that combine elements of both approaches.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary needs significant revisions to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. The writing is too academic, relying heavily on passive voice and complex noun phrases, which makes it dense and difficult to read. While factually accurate, the language needs to be simplified to meet plain language standards.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite passive sentences into active ones.** The summary uses passive voice excessively, which can make it unclear who is performing the action. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found 33 passive constructions, placing the text well beyond the typical range for a Plain Language Summary.\n   - **Problem:** \"...(when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of blood flow) and strokes (when the brain is damaged due to a lack of blood flow).\"\n   - **Reason:** This phrasing is indirect. Using an active verb makes it clearer and more engaging.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as \"...such as a heart attack (when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle) or a stroke (when a lack of blood flow damages the brain).\"\n\n2. **Replace complex terms and jargon with simpler, everyday language.** The text uses several technical terms and noun-heavy phrases that will be unfamiliar to many readers. The analysis confirms this, showing high use of complex and long words.\n   - **Problem:** \"...and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease.\"\n   - **Reason:** \"Modifiable cardiac risk factors\" is clinical jargon. A plain language summary should explain what this means in practical terms.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace this with something like \"...and to see if they helped people improve risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure or cholesterol.\"\n\n3. **Ensure key terms are used consistently.** The summary switches between \"hospital-based\" and \"centre-based\" rehabilitation, which could confuse readers.\n   - **Problem:** The title and first key message use \"hospital-based,\" but the rest of the text uses the more accurate term \"centre-based.\"\n   - **Reason:** Inconsistency can make the reader wonder if these are different things.\n   - **Suggestion:** Choose one term and use it throughout. We recommend using \"centre-based\" (as it accurately includes hospitals, sports centres, etc.) and changing the title and key messages to match.\n\n4. **Remove the redundant concluding paragraph.** The final paragraph repeats information that is already stated clearly in the 'Key messages' and 'What did we find?' sections.\n   - **Problem:** \"We found that both home-based and hospital-based rehabilitation seem to work equally well... Both approaches improved people's health and quality of life. However, we need more research to confirm these findings...\"\n   - **Reason:** This repetition makes the summary longer and less direct. The 'Key messages' section at the top is designed to provide this summary.\n   - **Suggestion:** Remove the entire final paragraph to make the summary more concise and impactful.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade are within an acceptable range (P25), there are significant deviations in sentence structure and vocabulary. The draft has an extremely high number of passive voice constructions (BEYOND_P90) and also deviates from typical patterns in its use of nominalizations, nouns, and complex/long words (all P90). These metrics indicate that the text is more academic and less direct than a typical PLS, supporting the need for simplification."
