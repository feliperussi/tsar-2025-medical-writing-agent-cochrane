  "key_messages": [
    "Home-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that helps your heart recover from illness or surgery, done at home) seems to be as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that helps your heart recover from illness or surgery, done in a hospital) for people with heart disease, with no significant difference found in terms of benefits, and no major unwanted or harmful effects reported.",
    "Both home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation appear to improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes, although the quality of evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm these findings, especially for patients with specific conditions such as those who have had heart failure or valve surgery.",
    "Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, and to explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of hybrid models that combine elements of both approaches, as well as to address the limitations of current studies, including the short duration of most trials and the lack of data on certain patient groups."

      "subheading": "What is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases. Traditionally, people who have had heart problems or procedures are offered centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes to help them recover and prevent further heart problems."

      "subheading": "What are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?",
      "content": "Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, on the other hand, can include digital or telehealth interventions and are designed to be done at home with support from healthcare staff. Both types of programmes aim to improve exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and reduce the risk of further heart problems."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease. They also wanted to determine whether one type of programme is more effective than the other in improving clinical outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, although the specific countries are not mentioned. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only three studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. The participants had a history of acute myocardial infarction, revascularisation, or heart failure. The studies compared home-based cardiac rehabilitation, which may include digital or telehealth interventions, with supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. Home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction, or revascularisation, or with heart failure. It is unclear if one type of rehabilitation has an effect on mortality or exercise capacity compared to the other. For every 100 people undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, the choice between home-based and centre-based programmes may make little to no difference in terms of clinical outcomes."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
