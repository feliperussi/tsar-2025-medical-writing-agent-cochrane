  "draft": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\n- Both types of rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n- We need more research to determine the long-term effects of home-based and hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks (when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of blood flow) and strokes (when the brain is damaged due to a lack of blood flow).\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nWe define centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes as supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely) and are designed to be done at home with support from healthcare staff.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine their effectiveness in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only 3 studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction (heart attack), or revascularisation (a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart), or with heart failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are overly long sentences, a high number of passive constructions, and the use of formal, noun-heavy phrases. These issues make the text less direct and harder to read than it could be. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\\n\\n1. **Break up long, complex sentences.** Some sentences combine too many ideas, making them difficult for readers to follow. Splitting them into shorter, single-idea sentences will significantly improve readability.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction (heart attack), or revascularisation (a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart), or with heart failure.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** This single sentence is 48 words long and contains multiple technical terms and concepts.\\n   - **Suggestion:** \\\"We found that both home-based and hospital-based rehabilitation seem to work equally well for people who have had a heart attack, a procedure to restore blood flow (revascularisation), or heart failure. Both approaches improved people's health and quality of life.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Use active voice to make the text more direct.** The draft frequently uses passive voice, which can make the writing feel formal and obscure who is performing the action. Rewriting these sentences in the active voice makes them more engaging.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** The passive phrase \\\"is limited by\\\" is indirect. \\\"Outcomes of interest\\\" is also jargon.\\n   - **Suggestion:** \\\"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies included were very small, and some did not report on all the results we were looking for. Also, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) with simple verbs.** The text often uses formal noun forms instead of more direct verbs. Changing these back to verbs makes the writing clearer and more concise.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"...we rated our confidence in the evidence to determine their effectiveness in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** \\\"Determine their effectiveness in improving\\\" is a wordy, noun-based phrase.\\n   - **Suggestion:** \\\"...we rated our confidence in the evidence to find out how well these programs improved people's health and quality of life.\\\"\\n\\nRevising the draft with these points in mind will make it much more accessible and useful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, the analysis flags three key areas for improvement that align with the editorial feedback. The number of passive voice constructions (27) is significantly higher than typical, and the counts for nominalizations (22) and complex words (119) are also elevated. Addressing these specific deviations will enhance the clarity and readability of the summary."
