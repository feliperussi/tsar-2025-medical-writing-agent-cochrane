  "draft": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\n- Both types of rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n- We need more research to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It includes conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. For example, a heart attack happens when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle. A stroke happens when a lack of blood flow damages the brain.\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nWe define centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes as supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. In home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, people rehabilitate at home with support from healthcare staff. These programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure or cholesterol, in patients with heart disease.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence. This helped us understand how well the programs improved people's health and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only 3 studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes for people who have had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, the studies included a small number of people, which can make the results less reliable. Some studies did not report on all the results we were looking for. Also, in some studies people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting (this is called not being 'blinded'). Knowing which treatment they received could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the effectiveness of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it can be made clearer and more direct for patients by addressing a few key style issues that make the text feel more academic than it needs to be. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite passive or awkward phrases to be more direct.** The metrics show a very high number of passive constructions (27 instances, well beyond the 90th percentile). This can make sentences feel formal and indirect.\n    *   **Problem:** '...in some studies people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting (this is called not being 'blinded').' \n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase 'this is called' is passive and clunky. It's clearer to define the term 'blinded' actively.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Also, some studies were not 'blinded', which means the people in them knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.'\n\n2. **Break up long, noun-heavy sentences.** The draft has a high number of nouns and nominalizations (words like 'mortality' instead of verbs), which can make sentences dense and hard to process.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and risk factors for heart disease...'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This is a long list of complex concepts packed into one sentence.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use a bulleted list to make this information easier to scan: 'We wanted to find out if the two types of programmes had different effects on a person's:\n        - risk of dying or getting sick\n        - ability to exercise\n        - quality of life\n        - risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure.'\n\n3. **Replace formal, academic phrasing with simpler, everyday language.** The number of complex words is higher than typical for a PLS, which can be a barrier for some readers.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We define centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes as supervised programmes...'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase 'We define... as' is formal. It's more natural to just state what something is.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are supervised programmes that take place in a hospital, sports centre, or community centre.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in many ways, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for typical PLS patterns (e.g., sentence length and readability scores). However, it deviates significantly in key areas of style. The use of passive voice is much higher than typical (BEYOND_P90), and the text is dense with nouns, nominalizations (noun-form verbs), and complex words (all in the P90 range). This suggests the writing is more formal and less direct than a typical PLS."
