  "draft": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease. \n- Both home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes. \n- Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks (when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of blood flow) and strokes (when the brain is damaged due to a lack of blood flow). \n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nCentre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely) and are designed to be done at home with support from healthcare staff.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine their effectiveness in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only three studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. Home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction (heart attack), or revascularisation (a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart), or with heart failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The main issues are the frequent use of passive voice and complex noun phrases, which make the text feel dense and impersonal. By converting these to more active, verb-driven sentences, the summary will be much easier for patients to read and understand. The feedback below focuses on the top 3 areas for improvement.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling in the median or best quartile ranges. However, there are significant deviations in four key areas that impact readability: the use of passive voice is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and there are more complex words, nouns, and nominalizations (P90) than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. These results support the editorial feedback to simplify sentence structures and vocabulary."
