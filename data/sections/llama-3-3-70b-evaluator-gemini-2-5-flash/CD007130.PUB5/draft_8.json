  "draft": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\n- Both types of rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n- We need more research to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as a heart attack (when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle) or a stroke (when a lack of blood flow damages the brain).\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nWe define centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes as supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. In home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, people do their rehabilitation at home with support from healthcare staff. These programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure or cholesterol, in patients with heart disease.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence. This helped us understand how well the programs improved people's health and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only 3 studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes for people who have had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, the studies included a small number of people, which can make the results less reliable. Some studies did not report on all the results we were looking for. Also, some studies were not 'blinded', meaning people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the effectiveness of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. However, I am recommending a few revisions to make the text more direct and easier for a lay audience to understand before final approval. The key areas for improvement involve converting passive or noun-heavy sentences into more active ones, which will enhance clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements I suggest:\n\n1.  **Make sentences more active and direct.** Some sentences are structured in a slightly roundabout way. Using more direct verbs will make them punchier and easier to follow.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"In home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, people do their rehabilitation at home with support from healthcare staff.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is a bit wordy. Using the verb form of \"rehabilitation\" makes the sentence more concise.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In home-based programmes, people rehabilitate at home with support from healthcare staff.\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the meaning of technical concepts in the limitations.** The explanation for 'blinding' is good, but could be more explicit about *how* this knowledge might affect the results.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"Also, some studies were not 'blinded', meaning people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"influenced the results\" is vague. Explaining *how* it could influence them is more helpful for the reader.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Also, in some studies people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting (this is called not being 'blinded'). Knowing which treatment they received could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify definitions by breaking them into shorter sentences.** The definition for cardiovascular disease is accurate but combines several ideas into one long sentence.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as a heart attack (when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle) or a stroke (when a lack of blood flow damages the brain).\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is grammatically correct but long. Shorter sentences are easier to process, especially when defining new concepts.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Cardiovascular disease includes conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. For example, a heart attack happens when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle. A stroke happens when a lack of blood flow damages the brain.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with most readability scores falling in the best quartile (67%). However, the analysis also supports the need for the suggested edits. The draft shows significant deviation from typical patterns in four key areas: passive voice (BEYOND_P90), nominalization (P90), total nouns (P90), and complex words (P90). These metrics indicate a pattern of using noun-heavy, less direct sentence structures. The recommended edits will help address these specific deviations and improve overall clarity."
