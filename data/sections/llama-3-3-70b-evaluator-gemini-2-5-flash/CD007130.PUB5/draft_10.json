  "draft": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\n- Both types of rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n- We need more research to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It includes conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. For example, a heart attack happens when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle. A stroke happens when a lack of blood flow damages the brain.\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nCentre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are done at home with support from healthcare staff. These programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on:\n- risk of dying or getting sick\n- ability to exercise\n- quality of life\n- risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence. This helped us understand how well the programs improved people's health and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only 3 studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes for people who have had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, the studies included a small number of people, which can make the results less reliable. Some studies did not report on all the results we were looking for. Also, some studies were not 'blinded', which means the people in them knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the effectiveness of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is clear and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions before it can be approved. The key messages are missing important context about the low certainty of the evidence, which is a critical point for readers. Additionally, the summary relies too heavily on passive voice, which makes the writing less direct and engaging. Focusing on these two areas will significantly improve the summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add Missing Context to Key Messages:** The key messages should reflect the low certainty of the evidence mentioned in the original abstract and limitations section.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This statement is accurate but incomplete. The original review found 'low-certainty evidence'. Omitting this context might give readers a false sense of confidence in the findings.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Based on low-certainty evidence, home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\"\n\n2. **Use Active Voice to Improve Clarity:** Many sentences are written in a passive style, which can make them feel indirect. Rewriting them in the active voice will make it clearer who is doing what.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are done at home with support from healthcare staff.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The passive construction ('are done') is less direct than an active one. It focuses on the program rather than the people participating in it.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In home-based programmes, people do their rehabilitation at home with support from healthcare staff.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the Explanation of Study Limitations:** The description of 'blinding' is a bit clunky and uses passive voice.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Also, some studies were not 'blinded', which means the people in them knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.\"\n   - - **Why it's a problem:** The phrasing is slightly indirect. Using a more active structure makes the concept easier to grasp quickly.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Finally, in some studies, people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting (this is known as not being 'blinded'). Knowing which group they were in could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has excellent readability, with most scores falling in the best quartile for Plain Language Summaries (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 9.6). However, the analysis also reveals significant stylistic deviations from typical PLS patterns. The use of passive voice is exceptionally high (26 instances, 'BEYOND_P90'), which is the primary issue to address. This contributes to high counts for nouns, nominalizations, and complex words, all of which are in the P90 range, indicating the text is less direct and action-oriented than is typical for a PLS."
