  "draft": "Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition better? Education programs probably help people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes lower their blood sugar levels. Education programs may also help people learn more about diabetes care and how to manage their own health, for example through diet, exercise, and checking their blood sugar. More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in the long term.\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem? Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. Diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. Many people with these conditions struggle to follow their complex treatment plans, which can lead to poor health outcomes.\n\nWhat are education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help? Education programs teach people about their conditions and how to manage them. The goal is to help people make lifestyle changes to improve their health. Healthcare professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, or educators, can deliver these programs by talking with people, giving them written materials, or using computer programs to teach them.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? We searched for studies that compared people who received an education program with those who received usual care. We focused on studies where people were randomly assigned to a group, as this design provides the most reliable evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? We found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for around 13.5 months to 18 months. Education programs may help people learn more about diabetes care and how to manage their own health. Education programs probably help people lower their blood sugar levels. However, we are uncertain if these programs affect other important outcomes, such as the risk of death, serious complications, or kidney failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited because the studies were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect results. Finally, the studies did not always report on all the health outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
