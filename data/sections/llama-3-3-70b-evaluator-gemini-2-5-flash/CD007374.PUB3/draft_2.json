  "draft": "Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition better?\n\nKey messages:\n- Education programs probably help people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes manage their blood sugar levels better by decreasing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) - a measure of average blood sugar control over the past 2 to 3 months.\n- Education programs may also improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices, such as diet, exercise, and blood glucose monitoring.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in the long term.\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. Diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. People with CKD and diabetes often have to follow complex treatment plans, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication regimens.\n\nWhat are education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help?\nEducation programs for people with CKD and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their conditions, how to manage them, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. These programs can be delivered by healthcare professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, or educators, and can include verbal, written, or computer-based instruction.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programs for people with CKD and diabetes. They aimed to determine whether these programs can improve health outcomes, such as blood sugar control, kidney function, and quality of life.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies on education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of these programs.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for around 13.5 months to 18 months. Education programs may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programs probably decrease a measure of blood sugar control in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

There is a critical factual omission in the key messages that could mislead readers about the certainty of the evidence. Additionally, the writing style relies heavily on abstract nouns instead of direct verbs (a high rate of 'nominalization'), which makes some sentences difficult to follow. Addressing these two issues will significantly improve the summary's clarity and accuracy for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling within the best quartile or median ranges. However, the analysis flags two significant deviations: the count of nouns is high (P90), and the use of nominalizations (abstract nouns formed from verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback to rephrase sentences using more direct, active verbs to improve clarity and readability."
