  "draft": "Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition better?\n\nKey messages:\n- Education programs probably help people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes manage their blood sugar levels better by decreasing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) - a measure of average blood sugar control over the past 2 to 3 months. However, the effect on other important health outcomes is unclear.\n- Education programs may also improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices, such as diet, exercise, and blood glucose monitoring. But the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in the long term.\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. Diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. We often see people with CKD and diabetes struggling to follow complex treatment plans, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication regimens.\n\nWhat are education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help?\nWe deliver education programs to teach individuals about their conditions, how to manage them, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. These programs can be delivered by healthcare professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, or educators, and can include verbal, written, or computer-based instruction. The goal of these programs is to help people with CKD and diabetes better understand their conditions and take an active role in managing their health.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programs for people with CKD and diabetes. They aimed to determine whether these programs can improve health outcomes, such as blood sugar control, kidney function, and quality of life. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence and identify areas where more research is needed.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies on education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of these programs.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for around 13.5 months to 18 months. Education programs may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programs probably decrease a measure of blood sugar control in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. However, the effect of education programs on other important clinical outcomes, such as death, serious complications, and kidney failure, is unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it can be made clearer and easier for patients to read by addressing three main issues:\n\n1.  **Use active verbs instead of noun phrases.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes sentences more abstract and harder to read. This is the most important change to improve clarity.\n    *   **Example:** \"...rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of these programs.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This is wordy and uses abstract nouns like 'confidence' and 'evaluation'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"...rated how certain we were about the evidence.\"\n\n2.  **Be consistent with personal pronouns.** The draft switches between \"The review authors\" and \"we\". Using \"we\" consistently makes the summary more direct and engaging.\n    *   **Example:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to evaluate...\"\n    *   **Problem:** Inconsistent voice can be confusing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if...\"\n\n    \n3.  **Simplify wordy sentences.** Some sentences are repetitive or use more words than necessary. Making them more concise will help readers grasp the key points faster.\n    *   **Example:** \"The goal of these programs is to help people with CKD and diabetes better understand their conditions and take an active role in managing their health.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is a bit long and could be more direct.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"These programs aim to help people understand their conditions and actively manage their health.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also supports the need for revision, highlighting significant deviation in four key areas. The score for 'nominalization' (using nouns instead of verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating a need to rewrite sentences with more direct verb actions. The counts for 'nouns', 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), and 'long_words' are also in the 90th percentile range, suggesting that simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure would improve clarity."
