  "key_messages": [
    "Education programmes probably help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition and improve their health by decreasing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (a measure of blood sugar control), but the effect on other clinical outcomes such as death, serious hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), and kidney failure is unclear, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Education programmes may also improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices, such as diet, exercise, and blood glucose monitoring, although the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in terms of long-term effects and outcomes that are important to patients, such as quality of life and the ability to manage their condition independently."

      "subheading": "What is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should, and diabetes is a condition where the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. People with CKD and diabetes often have to follow complex treatment plans, including taking medication, following a special diet, and monitoring their blood sugar levels. However, many people with CKD and diabetes have difficulty adhering to these plans, which can lead to poor health outcomes."

      "subheading": "What are education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help?",
      "content": "Education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their condition, how to manage it, and how to make healthy lifestyle changes. These programmes can be led by healthcare professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, or educators, and can be delivered in various formats, including group sessions, one-on-one counseling, or online modules. The goal of these programmes is to help people with CKD and diabetes better understand their condition, make informed decisions about their care, and develop the skills and confidence they need to manage their condition effectively."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes are effective in improving health outcomes, such as blood sugar control, kidney function, and quality of life. They also wanted to determine whether these programmes can help reduce the risk of complications, such as kidney failure, heart disease, and stroke. Additionally, the authors aimed to identify the most effective components of education programmes and how they can be tailored to meet the needs of individuals with CKD and diabetes."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. The studies were conducted over a follow-up period of up to 18 months. The population characteristics included people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes, but specific details on age, gender, and severity of condition were not provided. The studies took place in various countries, although the specific countries were not mentioned. The types of interventions included education programmes, which were compared to routine care alone. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease a measure of blood sugar control in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. However, the effect of education programmes on other important clinical outcomes, such as death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure, is unclear."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.",
