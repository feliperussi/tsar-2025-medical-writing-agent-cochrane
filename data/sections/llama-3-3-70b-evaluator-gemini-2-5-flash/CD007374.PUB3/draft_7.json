  "draft": "Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition better? \nEducation programs probably help people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes lower their blood sugar levels. \nEducation programs may also help people learn more about diabetes care and how to manage their own health, for example through diet, exercise, and checking their blood sugar. \nMore research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in the long term.\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem? \nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. \nDiabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. \nBoth conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. \nWe often see people with CKD and diabetes struggling to follow complex treatment plans, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication regimens.\n\nWhat are education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help? \nEducation programs teach people about their conditions and how to manage them. \nThe goal is to help people make lifestyle changes to improve their health. \nThese programs can be delivered by healthcare professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, or educators, and can include verbal, written, or computer-based instruction.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? \nWe searched for studies that compared people who received an education program with those who received usual care. \nWe focused on studies where people were randomly assigned to a group, as this design provides the most reliable evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. \nThe studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for around 13.5 months to 18 months. \nEducation programs may help people learn more about diabetes care and how to manage their own health. \nEducation programs probably help people lower their blood sugar levels. \nHowever, we are uncertain if these programs affect other important outcomes, such as the risk of death, serious complications, or kidney failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain technical terms in the 'Limitations' section.**\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term \"blinding\" is unexplained jargon. A patient reading this will not know what it means or why it's a limitation. The phrase \"incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest\" is also clunky and could be simpler.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting (a limitation known as 'lack of blinding'), which can affect results. Finally, the studies did not always report on all the health outcomes we were interested in.\"\n\n2. **Strengthen the 'Why it's a problem' section with context.**\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"We often see people with CKD and diabetes struggling to follow complex treatment plans, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication regimens.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence explains the challenge but misses the crucial consequence. Adding the 'so what'—that struggling with treatment leads to poor health—makes the importance of the review clearer.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Many people with these conditions struggle to follow their complex treatment plans. This can lead to poor health outcomes, which is why finding ways to help is important.\"\n\n3. **Make language more direct by using verbs instead of abstract nouns.**\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"These programs can be delivered by healthcare professionals... and can include verbal, written, or computer-based instruction.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"computer-based instruction\" is an example of a nominalization (an abstract noun made from a verb). Using the verb directly makes the sentence more active and easier to picture.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Healthcare professionals can deliver these programs by talking with people, giving them written materials, or using computer programs to teach them.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour draft is very readable overall, but the linguistic analysis supports the need for the changes above. The metric for 'nominalization' (using noun forms of verbs) is unusually high (23 instances, placing it in the 90th percentile of our corpus). Addressing the suggestions, particularly in points 1 and 3, will help reduce this and make the text more direct and engaging for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling within the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 9.22) and sentence structure is strong. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of abstract nouns instead of verbs) is in the 90th percentile. This suggests the text could be made more direct and active, a point that aligns with the editorial feedback to rephrase jargony or abstract sentences."
