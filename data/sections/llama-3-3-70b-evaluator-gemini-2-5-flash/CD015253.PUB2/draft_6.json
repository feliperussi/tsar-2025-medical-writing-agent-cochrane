  "draft": "Can autoinflation help children with fluid buildup in their ears?\n\nKey messages:\n- Autoinflation may improve quality of life for children with fluid buildup in their ears - a condition known as 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion, or OME). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- We are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear because the studies we found were small and had some flaws. Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the possible risk of ear pain.\n- Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why is it a problem?\nGlue ear is when fluid builds up in the middle ear. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss. If it lasts a long time, it may lead to behavioral problems or delays in learning to talk. To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to glue ear?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to clear fluid from the middle ear. It works by creating gentle pressure in the nose and the back of the throat, which encourages the Eustachian tube to open and helps ventilate the middle ear. We wanted to find out if autoinflation can help children with glue ear.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for glue ear?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for glue ear in children. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with glue ear. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to glue ear. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of glue ear. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, a few key improvements will make it even more accessible to readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Use more action verbs instead of nouns (nominalizations).** The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences feel abstract and less direct. This is most noticeable in the 'What did we find?' section.\n   - **Original:** \"Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to glue ear. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of glue ear. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long glue ear persists. However, it is unclear if autoinflation affects whether hearing returns to normal.\"\n\n2. **Explain technical concepts in simpler terms.** The 'Limitations' section uses terms that may be unfamiliar to a lay audience, even with the parenthetical explanation.\n   - **Original:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We have less confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting, which could have influenced the results (this is known as a 'lack of blinding'). Also, some studies did not report on all the results we were interested in.\"\n\n3. **Make the aims more direct and conversational.** The language in the 'What did we want to find out' section is a little formal.\n   - **Original:** \"We wanted to assess the benefits and harms of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We wanted to find out about the good and bad effects of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun forms of verbs) is exceptionally high (beyond the 90th percentile), with 29 instances compared to a typical median of under 13. This confirms the editorial feedback that converting these nouns back into verbs would improve clarity and directness."
