  "draft": "Can autoinflation help children with fluid buildup in their ears?\n\nKey messages:\n- Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with fluid buildup in their ears - a condition known as 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion, or OME). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- We are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear because the studies we found were small and had some flaws. Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the possible risk of ear pain.\n- Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why is it a problem?\nGlue ear is when fluid builds up in the middle ear. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss. If it lasts a long time, it may lead to behavioral problems or delays in learning to talk. To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to glue ear?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to clear fluid from the middle ear. It works by creating gentle pressure in the nose and the back of the throat, which encourages the Eustachian tube to open and helps ventilate the middle ear. We wanted to find out if autoinflation can help children with glue ear.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for glue ear?\nWe wanted to find out about the good and bad effects of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for glue ear in children. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with glue ear. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long glue ear persists. However, it is unclear if autoinflation affects whether hearing returns to normal. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting, which could have influenced the results (this is known as a 'lack of blinding'). Also, some studies did not report on all the results we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. The readability scores are excellent. I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' to highlight three specific improvements that will make the summary even clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n**1. Clarify the impact of study limitations.** The explanation for 'lack of blinding' is a bit vague for a lay reader.\n*   **Current sentence:** 'In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting, which could have influenced the results (this is known as a 'lack of blinding').' \n*   **Why it's a problem:** Readers may not understand *how* knowing the treatment could influence the results.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting. This knowledge might have influenced their answers about their child's quality of life or pain, a problem known as a 'lack of blinding'.'\n\n**2. Remove unnecessary technical jargon.** The summary introduces the full medical term for glue ear but never uses the abbreviation, adding unnecessary complexity.\n*   **Current phrase:** '...a condition known as 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion, or OME).'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Including 'otitis media with effusion, or OME' adds complexity without adding value for the reader, as the term isn't used again. 'Glue ear' is sufficient.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** '...a condition known as 'glue ear' (fluid buildup in the middle ear).'\n\n**3. Make key sentences more direct by using stronger verbs.** One of the key takeaway sentences is a bit dense due to its reliance on nouns.\n*   **Current sentence:** 'Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the possible risk of ear pain.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Using abstract nouns like 'inconvenience' and 'risk' makes the sentence less direct than it could be.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against how inconvenient the treatment is to perform regularly and the chance it might cause ear pain.'\n\nAddressing these points will enhance the clarity of an already solid summary. The linguistic analysis supports the third 'nominalizations' compared to typical summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, with 16 of 18 metrics (89%) falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. The text highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. The only significant deviation is in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is higher than usual (BEYOND_P90). While partly due to the key term 'autoinflation', this suggests an opportunity to make the language more direct by using more active verbs."
