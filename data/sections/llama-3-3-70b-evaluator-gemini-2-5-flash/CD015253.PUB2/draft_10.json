  "draft": "Can autoinflation help children with fluid buildup in their ears?\n\nKey messages:\n- Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with 'glue ear' (fluid in the middle ear). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- We are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear because the studies we found were small and had some flaws. We need to weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the chance it might cause ear pain.\n- Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why is it a problem?\nGlue ear is when fluid builds up in the middle ear. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss. If it lasts a long time, it may lead to behavioral problems or delays in learning to talk. To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to glue ear?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to clear fluid from the middle ear. It works by creating gentle pressure in the nose and the back of the throat, which helps open a small tube that connects the throat to the middle ear (the Eustachian tube). This lets air in and helps clear the fluid.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for glue ear?\nWe wanted to find out about the good and bad effects of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for glue ear in children. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with glue ear. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long glue ear persists. However, it is unclear if autoinflation affects whether hearing returns to normal. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting. This knowledge might have influenced their reports on their child's quality of life or pain. Also, some studies did not report on all the results we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

I have three suggestions to make it even more direct and easier for readers to understand before final approval.\n\n**1. Use more direct verbs instead of noun forms.**\nThe text sometimes uses noun forms of verbs (a pattern called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences feel abstract. Using the verb directly is more active and easier to follow.\n- **Original sentence:** \"This knowledge might have influenced their reports on their child's quality of life or pain.\"\n- **Problem:** The nouns \"knowledge\" and \"reports\" make the sentence less direct.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Knowing this might have affected how they reported on their child's quality of life or pain.\"\n\n**2. Make the explanation of autoinflation more explicit.**\nThe description of how autoinflation works is good, but could be even clearer by explicitly linking the action to the outcome.\n- **Original sentence:** \"This lets air in and helps clear the fluid.\"\n- **Problem:** Readers may not immediately understand *why* letting air in helps clear the fluid. A more direct connection would improve comprehension.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This lets air into the middle ear, which helps the trapped fluid drain away.\"\n\n**3. Simplify phrasing for key concepts.**\nSome phrases can be simplified to use more common, everyday language, making the text more accessible.\n- **Original sentence:** \"To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\"\n- **Problem:** The phrase \"use... treatments\" is slightly wordy and clinical.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or treat it with medicines, surgery, or special devices.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, with 94.4% of features falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. The only metric that deviates is 'nominalization' (the use of noun-forms of verbs), which is in the P90 range. This suggests an opportunity to replace abstract nouns with more active verbs to further improve clarity, as outlined in the feedback."
