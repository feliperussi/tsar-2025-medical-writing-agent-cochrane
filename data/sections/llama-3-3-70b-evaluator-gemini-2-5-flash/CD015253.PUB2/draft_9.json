  "draft": "Can autoinflation help children with fluid buildup in their ears?\n\nKey messages:\n- Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with fluid buildup in their ears, a condition known as 'glue ear' (fluid buildup in the middle ear). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- We are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear because the studies we found were small and had some flaws. We need to weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the chance it might cause ear pain.\n- Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why is it a problem?\nGlue ear is when fluid builds up in the middle ear. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss. If it lasts a long time, it may lead to behavioral problems or delays in learning to talk. To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to glue ear?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to clear fluid from the middle ear. It works by creating gentle pressure in the nose and the back of the throat, which encourages the Eustachian tube to open and helps ventilate the middle ear. We wanted to find out if autoinflation can help children with glue ear.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for glue ear?\nWe wanted to find out about the good and bad effects of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for glue ear in children. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with glue ear. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long glue ear persists. However, it is unclear if autoinflation affects whether hearing returns to normal. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting. Knowing which treatment their child received might influence how families reported on their child's quality of life or pain. Also, some studies did not report on all the results we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. The evaluation metrics confirm it is highly readable. All critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting have passed. However, a few minor revisions will significantly improve clarity for a patient audience before final approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Define key technical terms for the reader.**\nSome necessary medical terms are used without a simple explanation, which could confuse readers who are unfamiliar with the condition.\n- **Original sentence:** '...which encourages the Eustachian tube to open and helps ventilate the middle ear.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** Readers are unlikely to know what the 'Eustachian tube' is or what 'ventilate' means in this context.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** '...This helps open a small tube that connects the throat to the middle ear (the Eustachian tube). This lets air in and helps clear the fluid.'\n\n**2. Make sentences more direct by using stronger verbs.**\nThe analysis noted a high number of noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations). While the text is generally active, converting a few of these back into verbs will make key sentences more direct and easier to follow.\n- **Original sentence:** 'Knowing which treatment their child received might influence how families reported on their child's quality of life or pain.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'how families reported on' is slightly indirect and wordy.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'This knowledge might have influenced their reports on their child's quality of life or pain.'\n\n**3. Streamline the introduction of 'glue ear' to avoid repetition.**\nThe term 'glue ear' and its definition appear very close together in the key messages, making the opening slightly repetitive.\n- **Original sentence:** 'Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with fluid buildup in their ears, a condition known as 'glue ear' (fluid buildup in the middle ear).'\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'fluid buildup' is used twice in the same sentence. The definition is also provided in full in the next section.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** In the Key Message, simplify to: '...for children with 'glue ear' (fluid in the middle ear).' Then, rely on the full definition in the 'What is glue ear?' section to provide the details.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows this draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 16 of 18 metrics (89%) falling in the best quartile for readability and style. The readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 7.0). However, the analysis identified a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which scored 'BEYOND_P90'. This supports the editorial feedback that while the text is clear, some sentences could be made more direct by using stronger, more active verbs."
