  "draft": "Can autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) help children with fluid buildup in their ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that autoinflation may improve quality of life for children with otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear'). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts in the short term. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- Because the studies we found were small and had some flaws, we are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear. Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the possible risk of ear pain.\n- Future research should focus on providing higher-quality evidence to address the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and harms of autoinflation for otitis media with effusion, including its long-term effects and potential impact on important outcomes such as hearing loss, language development, and overall well-being.\n\nWhat is otitis media with effusion (OME) and why is it a problem?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity, which can cause hearing loss and lead to behavioral problems and delayed language skills in young children. It is a common condition among children, and its management includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical, and mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx. It is used as a treatment for OME, and its effectiveness is being assessed in this review.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for OME?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using autoinflation to treat OME in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for otitis media with effusion in children, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with otitis media with effusion. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, the text needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is the frequent use of abstract nouns and academic phrasing, which makes sentences less direct and harder to understand. The feedback below focuses on the top 3 improvements to make the summary more accessible.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace Abstract Nouns with Active Verbs**\n\nSome sentences are built around abstract nouns (nominalizations) instead of direct verbs, which makes them feel passive and academic.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"improvement in quality of life\" is an indirect way of saying the verb \"improve.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with this condition.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Wordy and Academic Phrases**\n\nThe final key message uses complex phrasing that is common in research papers but not in plain language summaries.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on providing higher-quality evidence to address the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and harms of autoinflation for otitis media with effusion, including its long-term effects and potential impact on important outcomes such as hearing loss, language development, and overall well-being.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 48-word sentence is long and uses phrases like \"address the uncertainties surrounding\" and \"potential impact on important outcomes,\" which are not everyday language.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\"\n\n**3. Use the Plain Language Term Consistently**\n\nThe summary does a great job of defining 'glue ear' but then often reverts to the technical term \"otitis media with effusion.\" Using the simpler term more often would improve readability.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The reader has already been given the simpler term 'glue ear' or 'fluid in the ear'. Reverting to the technical term makes the text feel more clinical and less reader-friendly.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"It may also slightly reduce how long the 'glue ear' lasts.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable, with excellent scores for sentence length (19.13 words/sentence) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.52), both falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis also reveals significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary. The number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is 34, which is far beyond the 90th percentile and the recommended median of <13. The total noun count is also high (165, P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback that the text relies too heavily on abstract nouns, which can reduce clarity and directness for the reader."
