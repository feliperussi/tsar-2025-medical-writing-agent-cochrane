  "draft": "Can autoinflation help children with fluid buildup in their ears?\n\nKey messages:\n- Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with fluid buildup in their ears - a condition known as 'glue ear' (fluid buildup in the middle ear). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- We are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear because the studies we found were small and had some flaws. Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against how inconvenient the treatment is to perform regularly and the chance it might cause ear pain.\n- Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why is it a problem?\nGlue ear is when fluid builds up in the middle ear. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss. If it lasts a long time, it may lead to behavioral problems or delays in learning to talk. To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to glue ear?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to clear fluid from the middle ear. It works by creating gentle pressure in the nose and the back of the throat, which encourages the Eustachian tube to open and helps ventilate the middle ear. We wanted to find out if autoinflation can help children with glue ear.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for glue ear?\nWe wanted to find out about the good and bad effects of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for glue ear in children. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with glue ear. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long glue ear persists. However, it is unclear if autoinflation affects whether hearing returns to normal. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting. This knowledge might have influenced their answers about their child's quality of life or pain, a problem known as a 'lack of blinding'. Also, some studies did not report on all the results we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few revisions would make it even more direct and easier for readers to follow. Here are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Use verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.** Some sentences are less direct because they use nouns instead of verbs (a style known as 'nominalization'). Using more active verbs makes the text less abstract and easier to understand.\n    *   **Example:** 'This knowledge might have influenced their answers about their child's quality of life or pain...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using a verb: 'Knowing which treatment their child received might have influenced how families reported on their child's quality of life or pain.'\n\n2. **Make phrasing more concise.** Some phrases can be shortened to improve flow and clarity, as recommended by the style guide.\n    *   **Example:** '...weigh the possible benefits against how inconvenient the treatment is to perform regularly...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Shorten this to: '...weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly...'\n\n3. **Define key terms only once.** The term 'glue ear' is defined in both the key messages and again in the first section. Defining it once in the main body of the text is less repetitive for the reader.\n    *   **Example:** The first key message includes the definition '(fluid buildup in the middle ear)'. The first section then states 'Glue ear is when fluid builds up in the middle ear.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the parenthetical definition from the key message and keep the full explanation in the 'What is glue ear...?' section.\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of 'nominalizations' compared to typical plain language summaries. Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is highly readable and conforms well to most typical PLS patterns, with 89% of features falling in the best quartile. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is high (27 instances, placing it in the 90th percentile), suggesting the text could be made more direct by using more active verbs."
