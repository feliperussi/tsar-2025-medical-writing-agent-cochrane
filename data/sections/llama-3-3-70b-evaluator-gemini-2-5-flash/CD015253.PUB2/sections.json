  "key_messages": [
    "Autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life related to otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear') and slightly reduce the persistence of the condition in the short term, but the evidence is uncertain regarding its effect on returning to normal hearing and potential harmful effects like ear pain.",
    "The current evidence does not provide clear answers to the question of whether autoinflation is beneficial for children with otitis media with effusion due to the low quality of the evidence, and it is essential to consider the potential inconvenience of regularly performing autoinflation and the possible risk of ear pain.",
    "Future research should focus on providing higher-quality evidence to address the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and harms of autoinflation for otitis media with effusion, including its long-term effects and potential impact on important outcomes such as hearing loss, language development, and overall well-being."

      "subheading": "What is otitis media with effusion (OME) and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity, which can cause hearing loss and lead to behavioral problems and delayed language skills in young children. It is a common condition among children, and its management includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical, and mechanical treatments."

      "subheading": "What is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME?",
      "content": "Autoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx. It is used as a treatment for OME, and its effectiveness is being assessed in this review."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the efficacy (benefits and harms) of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children, including its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with otitis media with effusion. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. The interventions compared autoinflation using a variety of different methods and devices to no treatment. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the studies. Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
