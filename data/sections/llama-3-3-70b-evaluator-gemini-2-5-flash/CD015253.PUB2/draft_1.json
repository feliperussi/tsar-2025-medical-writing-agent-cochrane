  "draft": "# Can autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) help children with fluid buildup in their ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life related to otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear') and slightly reduce the persistence of the condition in the short term, but the evidence is uncertain regarding its effect on returning to normal hearing and potential harmful effects like ear pain.\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers to the question of whether autoinflation is beneficial for children with otitis media with effusion due to the low quality of the evidence, and it is essential to consider the potential inconvenience of regularly performing autoinflation and the possible risk of ear pain.\n- Future research should focus on providing higher-quality evidence to address the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and harms of autoinflation for otitis media with effusion, including its long-term effects and potential impact on important outcomes such as hearing loss, language development, and overall well-being.\n**Introduction**\n### What is otitis media with effusion (OME) and why is it a problem?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity, which can cause hearing loss and lead to behavioral problems and delayed language skills in young children. It is a common condition among children, and its management includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical, and mechanical treatments.\n### What is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx. It is used as a treatment for OME, and its effectiveness is being assessed in this review.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about autoinflation for OME?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the efficacy (benefits and harms) of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children, including its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for otitis media with effusion in children, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with otitis media with effusion. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. The interventions compared autoinflation using a variety of different methods and devices to no treatment. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the studies. Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues with factual accuracy and subheading formatting, as well as significant clarity and style problems that would hinder patient understanding.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy:** The statement in the 'Results' section, 'Unfortunately, there is no information available on the funding sources of the studies,' is not present in the ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT or SOURCE_OF_TRUTH. This information should be removed as it is not supported by the source material.\n2.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which deviates from the Master Style Guide. The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' should be rephrased as questions (e.g., 'How did we do the review?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', 'How up to date is this evidence?').\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Issue: Overly Long and Complex Sentences (especially in Key Messages)**\n    *   **Quote:** 'Autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life related to otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear') and slightly reduce the persistence of the condition in the short term, but the evidence is uncertain regarding its effect on returning to normal hearing and potential harmful effects like ear pain.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is 59 words long and contains multiple clauses and parenthetical definitions, making it very difficult to read and understand for a lay audience. The repeated definitions of OME also make it clunky.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Autoinflation, a technique using a nasal balloon, might improve quality of life for children with otitis media with effusion (fluid buildup in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear'). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts in the short term. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.'\n\n2.  **Issue: Noun-Heavy and Nominalized Language**\n    *   **Quote:** 'Autoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** Phrases like 'fluid clearance' and 'providing positive pressure' are nominalizations (using nouns instead of verbs) which make the sentence less direct and harder to follow. The term 'nasopharynx' is also unexplained jargon.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Autoinflation is a self-administered technique. It aims to ventilate the middle ear and help clear fluid by pushing air into the nose and the upper part of the throat behind the nose (nasopharynx).'\n\n3.  **Issue: Wordiness and Redundancy**\n    *   **Quote:** 'The interventions compared autoinflation using a variety of different methods and devices to no treatment.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** The phrase 'using a variety of different methods and devices' is somewhat redundant and could be more concise.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The interventions compared autoinflation (which used various methods and devices) to no treatment.'\n\n4.  **Issue: Missing Blank Lines**\n    *   **Quote:** (Lack of blank lines between 'Key Messages' heading and the first bullet point, and between 'Introduction' heading and its first subheading.)\n    *   **Why problematic:** The Master Style Guide requires blank lines between paragraphs and headings to improve readability and visual separation. Their absence creates a dense block of text.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Add a blank line after the 'Key Messages' heading and before the first bullet point. Add a blank line after the 'Introduction' heading and before the first subheading.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nThe linguistic analysis strongly supports these observations. The draft shows significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in several key areas:\n*   **nominalization (42.0, BEYOND_P90):** This is a critical issue, indicating a high use of noun forms of verbs, making the text dense and less active. The target is to reduce this to <13.0.\n*   **nouns (196.0, P90):** The high noun count contributes to the text's density and often correlates with nominalization. The target is to reduce to <116.0.\n*   **smog_index (14.58, P90), complex_words_dc (252.0, P90), complex_words (140.0, P90), and long_words (196.0, P90):** These metrics collectively indicate that the text uses too many long and complex words, leading to a higher reading grade level than is typical for a PLS. This directly impacts clarity and readability for a general audience. The targets are to reduce these significantly.\n*   **words_per_sentence (24.38, P75):** While not in the highest percentile, this metric suggests that sentences are generally longer than ideal for a PLS, contributing to the overall complexity.\n\nAddressing these issues will significantly improve the clarity, readability, and adherence to Cochrane guidelines for Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 33.3% of features falling into the best quartile. However, several metrics show significant deviation, suggesting areas for substantial improvement. Notably, 'nominalization' is BEYOND_P90 (42.0, target <13.0), indicating excessive use of noun forms of verbs. 'Nouns' (196.0, P90, target <116.0), 'smog_index' (14.58, P90, target <12.1), 'complex_words_dc' (252.0, P90, target <160.0), 'complex_words' (140.0, P90, target <84.0), and 'long_words' (196.0, P90, target <122.0) all fall into the P90 range, highlighting issues with vocabulary complexity and overall text density. 'Words per sentence' (24.38, P75) is also on the higher side, suggesting sentences could be shorter for improved readability. These deviations collectively point to a text that is more complex and less direct than typical Plain Language Summaries."
