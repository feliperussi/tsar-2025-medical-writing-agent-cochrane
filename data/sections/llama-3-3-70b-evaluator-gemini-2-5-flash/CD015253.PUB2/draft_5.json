  "draft": "Can autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) help children with fluid buildup in their ears (otitis media with effusion, also known as 'glue ear')?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts in the short term. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- Because the studies we found were small and had some flaws, we are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear. Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the possible risk of ear pain.\n- Future studies should use better methods to be more certain about the benefits and harms of autoinflation. We especially need to know its long-term effects on hearing, language, and a child's well-being.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why is it a problem?\nGlue ear, or otitis media with effusion (OME), is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity, which can cause hearing loss and lead to behavioral problems and delayed language skills in young children. It is a common condition among children, and its management includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical, and mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to glue ear?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx. It is used as a treatment for glue ear, and its effectiveness is being assessed in this review.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about autoinflation for glue ear?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using autoinflation to treat glue ear in children. We looked at its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for glue ear in children, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with glue ear. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may moderately improve quality of life for children with glue ear. It may also slightly reduce how long the glue ear lasts. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is the frequent use of noun forms instead of active verbs (known as nominalization), which makes the text dense and harder to read. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The text often uses noun forms where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences more complex than necessary.\n   - **Quote:** \"...and its management includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical, and mechanical treatments.\"\n   - **Problem:** The words 'management' and 'treatments' are abstract nouns. Using verbs makes the sentence more active and easier to understand.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"To manage this condition, doctors may suggest 'watchful waiting' or use medical, surgical, or mechanical treatments.\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical descriptions.** Some sentences contain medical jargon that could be simplified for a non-technical reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"...by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx.\"\n   - **Problem:** 'Nasopharynx' is a technical term that most people won't know.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace it with a simpler description, such as: \"...by creating gentle pressure in the nose and the back of the throat.\"\n\n3. **Break down long, dense sentences.** The first paragraph of the introduction contains a lot of information in one long sentence, which can be overwhelming.\n   - **Quote:** \"Glue ear, or otitis media with effusion (OME), is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity, which can cause hearing loss and lead to behavioral problems and delayed language skills in young children.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence introduces the term, its abbreviation, the definition, and its consequences all at once.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break it into shorter, more focused sentences: \"Glue ear (also called otitis media with effusion, or OME) is when fluid builds up in the middle ear. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss. If it lasts a long time, it may lead to behavioral problems or delays in learning to talk.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your own editorial instincts about the text's density are confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very high number of 'nominalizations' (29), placing it in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, far from the typical median of 13 for a PLS. The total 'nouns' count is also high. Addressing the suggestions above will directly improve these metrics and make the summary much clearer for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in most areas, with 72% of features falling into the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis identified significant deviations in vocabulary choice. The 'nominalization' metric is rated 'BEYOND_P90' and the 'nouns' metric is 'P90', indicating the text relies too heavily on noun forms instead of verbs, making it denser than a typical PLS."
