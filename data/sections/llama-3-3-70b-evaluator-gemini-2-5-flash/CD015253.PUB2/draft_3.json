  "draft": "Can autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) help children with fluid buildup in their ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Autoinflation may improve quality of life for children with otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear'). It may also slightly reduce how long the condition lasts in the short term. However, we are uncertain if it helps restore normal hearing or if it causes harmful effects like ear pain.\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers to the question of whether autoinflation is beneficial for children with otitis media with effusion due to the low quality of the evidence. It is essential to consider the potential inconvenience of regularly performing autoinflation and the possible risk of ear pain.\n- Future research should focus on providing higher-quality evidence to address the uncertainties surrounding the benefits and harms of autoinflation for otitis media with effusion, including its long-term effects and potential impact on important outcomes such as hearing loss, language development, and overall well-being.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is otitis media with effusion (OME) and why is it a problem?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid builds up in the space behind the eardrum, which can cause hearing loss and lead to behavioral problems and delayed language skills in young children. Doctors manage this condition by watching and waiting, using medicine, surgery, or mechanical treatments.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and help clear fluid by pushing air into the nose and the upper part of the throat behind the nose (nasopharynx). It is used as a treatment for OME.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about autoinflation for OME?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children, including its effects on hearing, quality of life, and potential adverse effects such as ear pain.\n\nMethods\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for otitis media with effusion in children, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with otitis media with effusion. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with most requiring children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day. Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. In some studies, families knew which treatment their child was getting, which could have affected the results. Also, the studies did not always report on all the results we were looking for.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to make the language more direct and easier for a lay audience to understand. The main issues are the overuse of abstract nouns instead of active verbs (nominalization), some impersonal phrasing, and abstract descriptions of evidence quality. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use Verbs Instead of Nouns to Be More Direct:** The writing often uses noun forms where a simple verb would be clearer and more concise.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This is wordy and formal. Using direct verbs makes the writing more active and easier to follow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using autoinflation to treat OME in children.\"\n\n2. **Make Abstract Concepts Concrete:** Phrases about the quality of evidence can be confusing. Explain what they mean in practical terms.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The current evidence does not provide clear answers... due to the low quality of the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** \"Low quality of the evidence\" is an abstract concept for patients. Explaining *why* it's low quality (e.g., small studies) is more helpful.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Because the studies we found were small and had some flaws, we are not certain if autoinflation helps children with glue ear.\"\n\n3. **Use a More Personal and Active Tone:** Some sentences are written in a passive, impersonal style that creates distance from the reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It is essential to consider the potential inconvenience of regularly performing autoinflation and the possible risk of ear pain.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is indirect. Address the audience (parents and doctors) to make the advice more actionable.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Parents and doctors should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of doing the treatment regularly and the possible risk of ear pain.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These changes will help address the key issues identified in the linguistic analysis, particularly the exceptionally high number of nominalizations (38 instances, where under 13 is typical) and the high counts for nouns, long words, and complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft conforms well in terms of general readability and sentence length, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. The number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and the counts for total nouns, long words, and complex words are also in the highest 10% of the corpus (P90 range). These metrics indicate the language is less direct and more abstract than is ideal for a plain language summary."
