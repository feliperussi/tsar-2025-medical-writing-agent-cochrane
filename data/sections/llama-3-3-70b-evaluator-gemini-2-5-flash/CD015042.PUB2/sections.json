  "key_messages": [
    "Brief psychosocial interventions (treatments that focus on changing behaviors and thoughts through counseling or therapy) may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong.",
    "More research is needed to understand how well these interventions work, especially for women with alcohol use disorder (a condition where someone has a strong desire to drink alcohol, even if it harms their health), and to find out if there are any unwanted effects.",
    "Future studies should investigate the benefits and safety of different treatments, including medications, for pregnant women who drink alcohol, and should provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use and any other health conditions they may have."

      "content": "Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a common issue worldwide, with estimated rates of 10% globally and up to 25% in Europe. This can lead to harmful effects on the unborn baby, making it essential to address this problem. Common treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychosocial interventions and medications."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions and medications in reducing or stopping alcohol consumption during pregnancy. They wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in promoting abstinence, reducing alcohol consumption, and ensuring retention in treatment, while also considering potential adverse events."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands, with six of them taking place in the USA. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, which were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each. The interventions were typically provided at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the intervention. The population characteristics included pregnant women with a current or lifetime diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, with one study reporting almost half of the participants having a current diagnosis of AUD and another study reporting 40% of participants having a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. We did not find any studies that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day. Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed treatment."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.",
