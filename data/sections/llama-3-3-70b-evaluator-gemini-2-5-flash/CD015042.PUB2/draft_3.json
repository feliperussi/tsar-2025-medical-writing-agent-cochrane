  "draft": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\n- Brief psychosocial interventions (treatments that focus on changing behaviors and thoughts through counseling or therapy) may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong.\n- More research is needed to understand how well these interventions work, especially for women with alcohol use disorder (a condition where someone has a strong desire to drink alcohol, even if it harms their health), and to find out if there are any unwanted effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the benefits and safety of different treatments, including medications, for pregnant women who drink alcohol, and should provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use and any other health conditions they may have.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a common issue worldwide, with estimated rates of 10% globally and up to 25% in Europe. This can lead to harmful effects on the unborn baby, making it essential to address this problem. Common treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychosocial interventions and medications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if talking therapies (psychosocial interventions) or medications help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We also wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in promoting abstinence, reducing alcohol consumption, and making sure women completed the treatment, while also looking at any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on psychosocial and medication interventions to reduce or stop alcohol consumption during pregnancy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands, with six of them taking place in the USA. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, which were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each.\n\nThe main findings were:\n- Brief psychosocial interventions may help more women to stop drinking alcohol completely.\n- These interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day.\n- They probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed the treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and the women in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

The main issues are that a key finding about the lack of medication studies is missing, the methods section is too generic, and the explanation of study limitations could be clearer. Addressing these points will ensure the summary is complete and easy to understand.",

A significant majority of metrics (67%) fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, including low passive voice, good Flesch-Kincaid grade, and high use of active voice. All other metrics are within the median range. The draft has a strong stylistic and structural foundation with no statistical indicators of readability problems."
