  "draft": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy? \n- Brief psychosocial interventions (treatments that focus on changing behaviors and thoughts through counseling or therapy) may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong.\n- More research is needed to understand how well these interventions work, especially for women with alcohol use disorder (a condition where someone has a strong desire to drink alcohol, even if it harms their health), and to find out if there are any unwanted effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the benefits and safety of different treatments, including medications, for pregnant women who drink alcohol, and should provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use and any other health conditions they may have.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a common issue worldwide, with estimated rates of 10% globally and up to 25% in Europe. This can lead to harmful effects on the unborn baby, making it essential to address this problem. Common treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychosocial interventions and medications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see which treatments work best to help women stop drinking, drink less, and complete their treatment. We also looked for any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for all studies on this topic published up to January 2024.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands, with six of them taking place in the USA. Most studies tested how well talking therapies worked. The interventions were typically provided at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the intervention. The population characteristics included pregnant women with a current or lifetime diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, with one study reporting almost half of the participants having a current diagnosis of AUD and another study reporting 40% of participants having a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. We did not find any studies that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy. \n\nThe main findings were:\n- Brief psychosocial interventions may help more women to stop drinking alcohol completely.\n- These interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day.\n- They probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed the treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that meets all critical requirements and has excellent readability scores. However, a few key sentences contain technical language that could confuse readers. Addressing these will make the summary much clearer for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 recommended improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify the description of the study participants.** The current phrasing is too academic and dense.\n    *   **Original Text:** 'The population characteristics included pregnant women with a current or lifetime diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, with one study reporting almost half of the participants having a current diagnosis of AUD and another study reporting 40% of participants having a lifetime diagnosis of AUD.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 49-word sentence uses technical terms like 'population characteristics' and is repetitive, making it hard for a non-specialist to quickly grasp who was in the studies.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The women in these studies were pregnant and had problems with alcohol use. In one study, nearly half the women had a current alcohol use disorder. In another, 40% had been diagnosed with it at some point in their lives.'\n\n2. **Explain the research term 'blinding'.** This term is not common knowledge and needs a brief explanation.\n    *   **Original Text:** '...introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Readers are unlikely to know what 'blinding' means in a research context, so they won't understand this important limitation of the evidence.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** '...introducing potential bias. This is because the studies lacked 'blinding', which means the women knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.'\n\n3. **Make the sentence about intervention timing more direct and active.**\n    *   **Original Text:** 'The interventions were typically provided at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the intervention.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence uses the passive voice ('was reassessed') and the technical phrase 'outcome of alcohol use', making it less direct than it could be.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Women usually received the therapy near the end of their first trimester. Researchers then checked on their alcohol use 8 to 24 weeks later.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Metrics like average sentence length (21.08 words) and passive voice count (9 instances) are excellent. However, these strong overall scores mask a few specific sentences that are overly long and use technical language, which can hinder reader understanding."
