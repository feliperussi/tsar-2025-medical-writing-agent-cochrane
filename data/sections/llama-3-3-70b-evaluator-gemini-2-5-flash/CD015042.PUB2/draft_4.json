  "draft": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\n- Brief psychosocial interventions (treatments that focus on changing behaviors and thoughts through counseling or therapy) may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong.\n- More research is needed to understand how well these interventions work, especially for women with alcohol use disorder (a condition where someone has a strong desire to drink alcohol, even if it harms their health), and to find out if there are any unwanted effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the benefits and safety of different treatments, including medications, for pregnant women who drink alcohol, and should provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use and any other health conditions they may have.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a common issue worldwide, with estimated rates of 10% globally and up to 25% in Europe. This can lead to harmful effects on the unborn baby, making it essential to address this problem. Common treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychosocial interventions and medications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if talking therapies (psychosocial interventions) or medications help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We also wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in promoting abstinence, reducing alcohol consumption, and making sure women completed the treatment, while also looking at any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on psychosocial and medication interventions to reduce or stop alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We looked at studies from various databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, from their inception to January 2024. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies. We included studies that compared medications or psychosocial interventions to placebo, no intervention, usual care, or other medications or psychosocial interventions used to reduce or stop alcohol use during pregnancy.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands, with six of them taking place in the USA. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, which were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each. Notably, we did not find any studies that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy. \n\nThe main findings were:\n- Brief psychosocial interventions may help more women to stop drinking alcohol completely.\n- These interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day.\n- They probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed the treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and the women in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results. Additionally, we did not find any studies that looked at the effects of medications, which is an important area for future research.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs a final polish to simplify some formal and technical language carried over from the original abstract. Addressing the 3 points below will make it much easier for a lay audience to read and understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify the language used to describe the review's goals.**\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"We also wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in promoting abstinence, reducing alcohol consumption, and making sure women completed the treatment, while also looking at any unwanted effects.\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is quite long (31 words) and uses formal terms like \"determine\" and \"promoting abstinence.\" Shorter sentences with more common words are easier to follow.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to see which treatments worked best to help women stop drinking, drink less, and complete their treatment. We also looked for any unwanted effects.\"\n\n**2. Remove technical jargon from the methods description.**\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"We looked at studies from various databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, from their inception to January 2024.\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"from their inception\" is jargon, and listing specific database names is unnecessary detail for a plain language summary. The key information for the reader is the date.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for all studies on this topic published up to January 2024.\"\n\n**3. Use more direct, active verbs in the results section.**\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"Most studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions...\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"evaluated the efficacy of\" is wordy and less direct than a simple verb. Using stronger, more common verbs makes the text more engaging and easier to read.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Most studies tested how well talking therapies worked...\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence:\n\nYour own linguistic analysis supports these suggestions. The draft has a high number of long words and a high SMOG index score, both falling in the top 10% compared to other summaries. The suggested changes will help address this by replacing longer, more complex words with simpler alternatives.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile. However, two metrics deviate significantly: the SMOG index (P90) and the count of long words (P90). This suggests that while sentence structure is generally good, the vocabulary is more complex and uses longer words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which could affect readability for a lay audience."
