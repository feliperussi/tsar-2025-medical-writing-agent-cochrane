  "draft": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\n- Brief psychosocial interventions may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong.\n- More research is needed to understand how well these interventions work, especially for women with alcohol use disorder, and to find out if there are any unwanted effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the benefits and safety of different treatments, including medications, for pregnant women who drink alcohol, and should provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use and any other health conditions they may have.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a common issue worldwide, with estimated rates of 10% globally and up to 25% in Europe. This can lead to harmful effects on the unborn baby, making it essential to address this problem. Common treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychosocial interventions and medications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions and medications in reducing or stopping alcohol consumption during pregnancy. They wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in promoting abstinence, reducing alcohol consumption, and ensuring retention in treatment, while also considering potential adverse events.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on psychosocial and medication interventions to reduce or stop alcohol consumption during pregnancy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands, with six of them taking place in the USA. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, which were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each. The interventions were typically provided at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the intervention. The population characteristics included pregnant women with a current or lifetime diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, with one study reporting almost half of the participants having a current diagnosis of AUD and another study reporting 40% of participants having a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. We did not find any studies that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day. Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

The main issues are the use of technical jargon without explanation and a long, dense paragraph in the results section that is difficult to follow. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the results and break up the long paragraph.** The 'What did the review authors find?' section is a single, dense paragraph. The final three sentences are also very repetitive. Break this section into smaller paragraphs and use a bulleted list for the main findings to make them stand out.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day. Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed treatment.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that these brief talking therapies:\n     - may help more women to stop drinking alcohol completely.\n     - may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day.\n     - probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed the treatment.\"\n\n2. **Replace technical terms with plain language.** Several sections use research jargon that will be unfamiliar to most readers. Explain these concepts in everyday language.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...ensuring retention in treatment, while also considering potential adverse events.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...making sure women completed the treatment, and looking at any unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...the women in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\"\n\n3. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of complex nouns.** Some sentences are noun-heavy, which makes them feel academic and harder to process. This is reflected in the high 'nominalization' score.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions and medications in reducing or stopping alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if talking therapies (psychosocial interventions) or medications help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags several important deviations related to vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nominalization' (use of noun forms instead of verbs), 'complex_words', 'long_words', and 'nouns' are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more dense and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. These metrics support the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and rephrase noun-heavy sentences to improve clarity for a lay audience."
