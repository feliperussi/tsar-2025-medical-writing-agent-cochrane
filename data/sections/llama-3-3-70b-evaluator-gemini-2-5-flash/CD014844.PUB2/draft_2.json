  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery (prophylactic antibiotics) helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection after a miscarriage - but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and hospitalization for infection treatment - but these findings are very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies to provide clearer answers on the benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage.\n\n**What is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?**\nEarly pregnancy loss (EPL) is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. Procedural management of EPL involves removing any residual pregnancy tissue from the uterus. While clinical evidence and guidance are clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women experiencing EPL with signs and symptoms of infection - it is less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are routinely required during procedural management in those without features of infection.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. They aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications - and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 6 studies that involved 4371 people undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss - but the evidence is uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may make little to no difference in the risk of vomiting and diarrhea - and may increase the risk of allergy. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and may reduce hospitalization for treatment of infection - but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small - participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation - and the studies were conducted in different populations or used different delivery methods for the intervention - leading to heterogeneity.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is a critical factual omission that misrepresents the review's main conclusion. The summary also contains contradictory statements and uses dense, noun-heavy language that makes it difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Accurately represent the main finding.** The draft omits the most important, high-certainty finding from the review. It focuses only on the low-certainty result from the main analysis, which is misleading.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We found that prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection after a miscarriage - but the evidence is uncertain.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This completely misses the review's key conclusion from the sensitivity analysis, which found a definite benefit with high certainty. Readers are left with the incorrect impression that antibiotics are likely ineffective.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"When we looked at all six studies, giving antibiotics beforehand may have little or no effect on uterine infections, but this evidence was of low certainty. However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies (which included 85% of all participants), we found with high certainty that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.** The text frequently uses complex noun forms instead of simple verbs (a style called 'nominalization'). This makes sentences dense and hard to follow.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Procedural management of EPL involves removing any residual pregnancy tissue from the uterus.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"procedural management\" and \"removing\" are abstract and clinical. Using direct verbs makes the action clearer.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To manage an early pregnancy loss, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus).\"\n\n3. **Resolve contradictory statements.** The Key Messages and the main results section present conflicting information about the primary outcome, which will confuse the reader.\n   - **Problematic Text:** The first Key Message states antibiotics \"may have little or no effect,\" while the \"What did we find?\" section states they \"may reduce the risk.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The reader is presented with two different conclusions about the same outcome. The summary must be internally consistent.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Resolving this requires addressing point #1 above. By clearly explaining the results of both the main analysis and the sensitivity analysis, this contradiction will be resolved naturally.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity in sentence length and voice, but reveals significant issues with vocabulary and readability. The 'nominalization' score is extremely high (BEYOND_P90 at 40.0), confirming the use of dense, noun-heavy language. This contributes to poor readability scores, with the Flesch Reading Ease being very low (P10) and several grade-level indicators being high (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback that the text needs to be simplified by converting nouns back into verbs to improve clarity for a lay audience."
