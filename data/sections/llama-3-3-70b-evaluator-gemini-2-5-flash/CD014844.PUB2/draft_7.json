  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a procedure to manage a miscarriage, known as a uterine evacuation procedure, can help prevent infection. \n\n- In the highest-quality studies, giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation procedure reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- When weaker studies were also included, the overall evidence for giving antibiotics was less certain.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss, when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation, can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus), sometimes called a uterine evacuation procedure. While it's clear that women with signs of infection need antibiotics, it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to see if routine antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. They also wanted to know if prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women. When we combined all studies, the results were uncertain. However, when we looked at the three strongest studies (including 85% of the women), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft, but it needs revision because it omits critical information about the potential harms and side effects of the antibiotics. A Plain Language Summary must present a balanced view of both benefits and risks. Additionally, the summary relies heavily on noun-based phrases, which makes the text less direct and harder to read. Addressing these two issues will significantly improve the summary's clarity and usefulness for patients.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Include findings on potential side effects.**\n   - **Problem:** The summary focuses only on the benefits of antibiotics but completely omits the findings on harms like vomiting, diarrhoea, and allergic reactions. This presents an unbalanced picture. The original abstract states: \"Prophylactic antibiotics likely result in little or no difference in the risk of vomiting... and likely result in little or no difference in the risk of having diarrhoea... Prophylactic antibiotics may increase the risk of allergy...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a key message and a sentence in the 'What did we find?' section to reflect this. For example, add a key message like: \"- We are uncertain about side effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions from these antibiotics because the evidence was limited.\" In the results section, add: \"The review also looked at side effects but found little to no difference in the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea. The evidence about allergic reactions was very uncertain.\"\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.**\n   - **Problem:** The text frequently uses nouns to describe actions (e.g., 'uterine evacuation', 'antibiotic treatment', 'hospitalization'), which can make sentences feel abstract and dense. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a very high number of 'nominalizations'.\n   - **Quote:** \"Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite the sentence to be more direct and patient-focused. For example: \"Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection...\"\n\n3. **Define key technical terms in the main text.**\n   - **Problem:** The term 'prophylactic antibiotics' is defined in the title but not in the main body of the text. Readers who skip straight to the main content may not understand this key term.\n   - **Quote:** \"...it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need prophylactic antibiotics.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a simple, parenthetical definition the first time the term appears in the body. For example: \"...it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given to prevent an infection from starting).\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, there is one significant deviation: the 'nominalization' metric is rated 'BEYOND_P90', with 29 instances found. This indicates an over-reliance on noun forms instead of verbs, which supports the editorial recommendation to rephrase sentences to be more direct and active."
