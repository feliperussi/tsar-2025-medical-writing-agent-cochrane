  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus (prophylactic antibiotics) can help prevent infection. \n\n- Overall, the evidence for giving antibiotics was uncertain because some studies had weaknesses. However, when we looked only at the three largest and highest-quality studies (which included 85% of all women in the review), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss (when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation) can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus). While it's clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women with signs and symptoms of infection, it's less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are needed for those without infection signs.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to see if routine antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. They also wanted to know if prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women. When we combined all studies, the results were uncertain. However, when we looked at the three strongest studies (including 85% of the women), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets most style guidelines. However, it is not approved because a few key clarity issues prevent it from being as helpful as possible for the reader. The main findings in the key messages are structured in a confusing way, the text uses inconsistent terms for the medical procedure, and several sentences are unnecessarily formal and wordy. Addressing these three areas will significantly improve the summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the Main Finding in the Key Messages:** The first key message starts by saying the evidence is uncertain before presenting the clear, main finding. This buries the lead and may confuse readers. Lead with the most important result from the best evidence.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- Overall, the evidence for giving antibiotics was uncertain because some studies had weaknesses. However, when we looked only at the three largest and highest-quality studies (which included 85% of all women in the review), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- In the highest-quality studies, giving antibiotics before a procedure to manage a miscarriage reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- When weaker studies were also included, the overall evidence for giving antibiotics was less certain.\"\n\n2. **Use Consistent Terminology for the Procedure:** The summary uses a plain language description (\"procedure to remove pregnancy tissue\") and the technical term (\"uterine evacuation procedures\") interchangeably without linking them. This may make readers wonder if they are different things.\n   - **Problematic text:** The summary uses \"a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus\" in the first sentence but then switches to \"uterine evacuation procedures\" in the 'Aims' and 'Methods' sections.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Define the term the first time you use it. For example, in the 'What is early pregnancy loss...' section: \"...a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus). This is sometimes called a uterine evacuation procedure.\"\n\n3. **Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Direct Verbs:** The text often uses formal, noun-based phrases where simpler verbs would be clearer and more direct. This makes the text less conversational.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"While it's clear that antibiotic **treatment is needed** for women with signs and symptoms of infection...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"While it's clear that women with signs of infection **need antibiotics**...\"\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...it's less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics **are needed** for those without infection signs.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...it's less clear whether those without signs of infection **need** prophylactic antibiotics.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the text shows a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun forms of verbs), which is in the 'BEYOND_P90' range. This metric supports the editorial feedback to replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs to improve clarity."
