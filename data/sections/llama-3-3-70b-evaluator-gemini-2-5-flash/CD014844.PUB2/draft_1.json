  "draft": "# Are antibiotics before surgery (prophylactic antibiotics) helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n**Key Messages**\n- Prophylactic antibiotics (medicines given to prevent infection) may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection after a miscarriage, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding, especially since harmful effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and allergy were not clearly reported.\n- The current evidence suggests that prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and hospitalization for infection treatment, but these findings are very uncertain and require further investigation to be confirmed.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as poor follow-up and high non-compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis, to provide clearer answers on the benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage.\n**Introduction**\n### What is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss (EPL) is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. Procedural management of EPL involves removing any residual pregnancy tissue from the uterus. While clinical evidence and guidance are clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women experiencing EPL with signs and symptoms of infection, it is less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are routinely required during procedural management in those without features of infection.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. They aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications, and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 4371 people undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific locations were not mentioned. Most studies compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment. The population characteristics, such as age and severity of condition, were not reported. The studies did not provide information on the duration of the interventions. The funding sources for the studies were also not mentioned. The interventions included routine antibiotic prophylaxis, and the comparisons were made with placebo or no treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, but the evidence is uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may make little to no difference in the risk of vomiting and diarrhoea, and may increase the risk of allergy. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and may reduce hospitalisation for treatment of infection, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different populations or used different delivery methods for the intervention, leading to heterogeneity.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

Additionally, the text deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns, particularly in readability (low Flesch Reading Ease, high grade levels), sentence length, vocabulary complexity (high complex words, long words), and excessive nominalization. These issues make the text difficult for a general audience to understand. Specific improvements are needed in subheading formatting, sentence length, vocabulary, and reducing passive voice and nominalization.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Only 22.2% of features fall into the best quartile, and 22.2% are 'Beyond P90', indicating substantial deviation. Key areas needing improvement include:\n\n*   **Readability:** Flesch Reading Ease (27.92) is in the P10 range, indicating very difficult text. Correspondingly, grade-level metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (14.98), Automated Readability Index (15.41), Coleman-Liau Index (14.77), Gunning Fog Index (20.27), LIX (62.07), RIX (8.92), and SMOG Index (15.92) are all in the P90 or Beyond P90 ranges, suggesting the text requires a very high level of education to understand.\n*   **Vocabulary Complexity:** Metrics for complex words (Dale-Chall: 260.0, P90; 3+ syllables: 165.0, Beyond P90) and long words (232.0, Beyond P90) are very high, indicating overly complex vocabulary.\n*   **Nominalization:** The nominalization count (53.0) is 'Beyond P90', which is extremely high and contributes to dense, noun-heavy sentences.\n*   **Nouns:** The total noun count (176.0) is in the P90 range, further supporting the issue of noun-heavy text.\n*   **Sentence Structure:** While words per sentence (22.62, P75) is on the higher side, the high passive voice count (15.0, P75) also contributes to less direct and harder-to-follow sentences."
