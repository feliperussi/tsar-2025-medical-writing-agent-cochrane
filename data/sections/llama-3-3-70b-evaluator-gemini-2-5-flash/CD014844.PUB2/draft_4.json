  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery (prophylactic antibiotics) helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection after a miscarriage, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- When we looked at the three highest-quality studies, which included 85% of all participants, we found that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\n**What is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?**\nEarly pregnancy loss (EPL) is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage an early pregnancy loss, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus). While clinical evidence and guidance are clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women experiencing EPL with signs and symptoms of infection, it is less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are routinely required during procedural management in those without features of infection.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. They aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications, and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 6 studies that involved 4371 people undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. When we combined all six studies, the results were uncertain. This was because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. However, when we looked only at the three strongest, high-quality studies (which included most of the women), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may make little to no difference in the risk of vomiting and diarrhea, and may increase the risk of allergy.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few key reasons. In some studies, many women did not complete the follow-up appointments, and many did not take the antibiotics as instructed. This makes the results less reliable. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Additionally, the studies were very small, and the participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, leading to heterogeneity.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is that the key findings are presented in a confusing order, potentially leaving readers unsure about the main message. The text also uses formal language, complex words, and noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) that make it difficult to read, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis. The limitations section is also a bit repetitive and uses unexplained jargon. By addressing these 3-4 key areas, the summary can become much clearer and more helpful for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns in sentence length and use of active voice. However, it flags significant deviations in vocabulary complexity and style. The draft has an unusually high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is 'Beyond P90'. It also scores in the P90 range for several complexity metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, and long words, indicating the vocabulary is more difficult than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback below targets these specific areas for improvement."
