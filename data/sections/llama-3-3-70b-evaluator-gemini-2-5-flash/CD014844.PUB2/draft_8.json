  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a procedure to manage a miscarriage, known as a uterine evacuation procedure (a surgery to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus), can help prevent infection. \n\n- In the highest-quality studies, giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation procedure reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- When weaker studies were also included, the overall evidence for giving antibiotics was less certain.\n- Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n- We are uncertain about side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, or allergic reactions from these antibiotics because the evidence was limited.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss, when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation, can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus), sometimes called a uterine evacuation procedure (a surgery to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus). While it's clear that women with signs of infection need antibiotics, it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given to prevent an infection from starting).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to see if routine antibiotic prophylaxis (prophylactic antibiotics) can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. They also wanted to know if prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women. When we combined all studies, the results were uncertain. However, when we looked at the three strongest studies (including 85% of the women), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. The review also looked at side effects but found little to no difference in the risk of vomiting or diarrhea. The evidence about allergic reactions was very uncertain. Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is a critical factual inaccuracy in the key messages, which misrepresents the review's main findings by prioritizing a secondary analysis. The summary of side effects is also inaccurate. Additionally, the text uses overly complex and repetitive language, and relies heavily on noun-based phrases (nominalizations) instead of direct verbs, making it difficult to read. Please revise based on the specific feedback below.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy in Key Messages**\n\nThe key messages do not accurately reflect the review's primary conclusion. The draft emphasizes a 43% risk reduction from a high-quality subgroup, presenting it as the main finding. However, the review's main analysis, including all studies, found the evidence was uncertain and that antibiotics 'may have little or no effect'. This framing is misleading to the reader.\n\n- **Problematic Text:**\n  - \"In the highest-quality studies, giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation procedure reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n  - \"When weaker studies were also included, the overall evidence for giving antibiotics was less certain.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This reverses the importance of the findings. The main result should be presented first, followed by the result from the secondary (sensitivity) analysis. The current wording could lead a reader to believe the benefit is much more certain than it is.\n- **Suggested Rewrite (based on SOURCE_OF_TRUTH):**\n  - \"Giving antibiotics before surgery to manage a miscarriage may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection, but the evidence is uncertain.\"\n  - \"However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies, we found that giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify Definitions and Reduce Repetition**\n\nThe draft defines the same technical term multiple times and uses complex phrasing where simpler words would work.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...a uterine evacuation procedure (a surgery to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus)...\" is used in the first paragraph, and then again in the 'What is early pregnancy loss' section.\n- **Why it's a problem:** Repeating long definitions is cumbersome for the reader. Define it once clearly and then use the simpler term.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** In the first paragraph, write: \"We looked at whether giving antibiotics before a 'uterine evacuation' (a surgery to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus) can help prevent infection after a miscarriage.\" For the rest of the summary, you can just use \"uterine evacuation\" or \"the procedure\".\n\n**2. Replace Complex Nouns with Simple Verbs (Reduce Nominalizations)**\n\nThe text frequently uses nouns created from verbs (e.g., 'management' instead of 'manage'), which makes sentences less direct and harder to read. This is reflected in the very high 'nominalization' score.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"The authors wanted to see if routine antibiotic prophylaxis (prophylactic antibiotics) can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and noun-heavy ('prophylaxis', 'infection', 'complications', 'procedures'). Using direct verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent infection reduces the risk of uterine infection and other problems for women who have this procedure after a miscarriage.\"\n\n**3. Use Simpler, Everyday Vocabulary**\n\nThe draft uses many long and complex words that could be replaced with simpler alternatives. This contributes to the high scores for 'complex_words' and 'long_words'.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given to prevent an infection from starting).\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Prophylactic\" is a technical term. While it's defined, the sentence structure is still complex. Using the definition directly is often clearer.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...it's less clear if women without signs of infection need antibiotics to prevent an infection from starting.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in some areas, with excellent sentence length (words_per_sentence in P25) and use of active voice (P75). However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and style. The 'nominalization' score is 'BEYOND_P90', indicating a very high use of noun-based phrases instead of direct verbs. Additionally, metrics for vocabulary complexity ('smog_index', 'complex_words', 'long_words') are all in the P90 range, confirming that the text uses too many multi-syllable and long words, which harms readability for a lay audience."
