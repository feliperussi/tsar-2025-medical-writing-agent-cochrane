  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (a surgery to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus) can help prevent infection. \n\n- Giving antibiotics before surgery may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies, we found that giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n- We are uncertain about side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, or allergic reactions from these antibiotics because the evidence was limited.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus), sometimes called a uterine evacuation. While it's clear that women with signs of infection need antibiotics, it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need antibiotics to prevent an infection from starting.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent infection reduces the risk of uterine infection and other problems for women who have this procedure after a miscarriage. We also wanted to know if antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women. The studies showed that antibiotics may have little or no effect on uterine infection, but the evidence is uncertain. When we looked at the three strongest studies, the evidence was clearer: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. The review also looked at side effects but found little to no difference in the risk of vomiting or diarrhea. The evidence about allergic reactions was very uncertain. Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear in many areas. The sentence length is good and you've used active voice well. To make it even better for readers, I have three main suggestions.\n\n1. **Clarify the main finding in the key messages.**\n   - **The issue:** The first two bullet points in the key messages can seem contradictory when read in isolation. A reader might be confused about whether the antibiotics are effective or not.\n   - **Original text:** \"- Giving antibiotics before surgery may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies, we found that giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Combine these points to explain the nuance upfront. For example: \"Overall, the evidence was uncertain about whether giving antibiotics before surgery prevents infection. However, when we looked only at the highest-quality studies, the evidence was clearer, showing that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).**\n   - **The issue:** The text often uses nouns to describe actions (e.g., 'procedural management', 'uterine evacuation procedures'), which can make sentences feel abstract and less direct. This is reflected in the high number of nominalizations found in the analysis.\n   - **Original text:** \"We searched for studies comparing antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Rephrase with more active verbs. This also provides an opportunity to define 'placebo'. For example: \"We searched for studies that compared giving antibiotics to giving a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment to women who were having this procedure after a miscarriage.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent, everyday language for the medical condition.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary switches between the terms 'miscarriage' (in the title) and 'early pregnancy loss' (in the body). While both are correct, sticking to one common term improves readability.\n   - **Original text:** \"What is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem? Early pregnancy loss is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Since the title uses the more common term 'miscarriage', I recommend using it throughout. For example: \"What is a miscarriage? A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length (17.1 words) and passive voice (8 instances) are excellent. However, the analysis highlights significant deviations in vocabulary and style. The number of nominalizations (35) is well beyond the typical range, indicating an overuse of noun forms instead of direct verbs. The SMOG index and count of complex words are also high (in the P90 range), suggesting that while the sentences are short, the vocabulary could be simplified further to improve reader comprehension."
