  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (a surgery to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus) can help prevent infection. \n\n- Overall, the evidence was uncertain about whether giving antibiotics before surgery prevents infection. However, when we looked only at the highest-quality studies, the evidence was clearer, showing that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n- We are uncertain about side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, or allergic reactions from these antibiotics because the evidence was limited.\n\nWhat is a miscarriage? \nA miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus), sometimes called a uterine evacuation. While it's clear that women with signs of infection need antibiotics, it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need antibiotics to prevent an infection from starting.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent infection reduces the risk of uterine infection and other problems for women who have this procedure after a miscarriage. We also wanted to know if antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do? \nWe searched for studies that compared giving antibiotics to giving a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment to women who were having this procedure after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women. The studies showed that antibiotics may have little or no effect on uterine infection, but the evidence is uncertain. When we looked at the three strongest studies, the evidence was clearer: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. The review also looked at side effects but found little to no difference in the risk of vomiting or diarrhea. The evidence about allergic reactions was very uncertain. Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, a few key improvements are needed to ensure the main findings are as clear as possible for a lay audience. The current presentation of the results could be confusing, and simplifying some of the language will make the summary much easier to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Clarify the main finding to avoid confusion.**\n\n*   **Problem:** The summary presents a seemingly contradictory result upfront, stating the evidence is \"uncertain\" but then immediately giving a very specific number: \"antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%\". This can confuse readers, who may not grasp the nuance between the overall evidence and the high-quality evidence.\n*   **Quote:** \"Overall, the evidence was uncertain about whether giving antibiotics before surgery prevents infection. However, when we looked only at the highest-quality studies, the evidence was clearer, showing that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Reorder the sentence to present the most reliable finding first, then explain the uncertainty. For example: \"When we looked at the highest-quality evidence, we found that giving antibiotics before surgery reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. However, when we included all available studies (some of which had weaknesses), the overall result was less clear.\"\n\n**2. Simplify sentence structure by using more direct verbs.**\n\n*   **Problem:** The text frequently uses nouns created from verbs (e.g., 'treatment' instead of 'treat'). This pattern, called nominalization, can make sentences more abstract and harder to follow. The linguistic analysis confirms this is a significant issue in the draft.\n*   **Quote:** \"We also wanted to know if antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase using active verbs. For example: \"We also wanted to know if women who received antibiotics were less likely to need more antibiotic treatment or to be admitted to the hospital.\"\n\n**3. Use consistent and simple terminology for the medical procedure.**\n\n*   **Problem:** The summary uses several different terms for the same procedure ('surgery', 'uterine evacuation', 'this procedure'). This inconsistency can make it harder for readers to follow the text.\n*   **Quote:** \"...a uterine evacuation (a surgery to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus)...\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Define the term once and then stick to the simplest version. For example: \"After a miscarriage, a surgical procedure called a 'uterine evacuation' is sometimes needed to remove remaining pregnancy tissue from the womb. We wanted to know if giving antibiotics before this surgery helps prevent infection.\" Then, continue using \"the surgery\" or \"the procedure\" throughout the text.\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length, use of active voice, and pronoun use are all excellent. However, the analysis identified two key areas for improvement. The 'nominalization' score is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), indicating an overuse of noun-based phrases instead of direct verbs, which can reduce clarity. Additionally, the 'SMOG index' is high (P90), suggesting that the density of multi-syllable words could make the text challenging for some readers. The recommended edits focus on addressing these specific issues to improve comprehension."
