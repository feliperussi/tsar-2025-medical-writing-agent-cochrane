  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery (prophylactic antibiotics) helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that when all studies were considered, giving antibiotics beforehand may have little or no effect on uterine infections, but this evidence was of low certainty. \n- However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies (which included 85% of all participants), we found with high certainty that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and hospitalization for infection treatment - but these findings are very uncertain.\n\n**What is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?**\nEarly pregnancy loss (EPL) is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage an early pregnancy loss, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus). While clinical evidence and guidance are clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women experiencing EPL with signs and symptoms of infection - it is less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are routinely required during procedural management in those without features of infection.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. They aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications - and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 6 studies that involved 4371 people undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. When we looked at all six studies, giving antibiotics beforehand may have little or no effect on uterine infections, but this evidence was of low certainty. However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies (which included 85% of all participants), we found with high certainty that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. Prophylactic antibiotics may make little to no difference in the risk of vomiting and diarrhea - and may increase the risk of allergy. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and may reduce hospitalization for treatment of infection - but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small - participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation - and the studies were conducted in different populations or used different delivery methods for the intervention - leading to heterogeneity.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it isn't ready for publication. There are two critical issues that must be addressed: a required section is missing, and the 'Limitations' section omits key information from the original review. Additionally, several improvements are needed to make the findings clearer for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Missing Section:** The draft is missing the 'Methods' section, which is required to explain how the review was conducted.\n2.  **Incomplete Limitations:** The 'Limitations' section omits the most important limitations mentioned in the original abstract's conclusion (poor follow-up and non-compliance).\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Clarify the main finding to avoid confusion.**\nThe summary presents two different results back-to-back, which could confuse readers about whether antibiotics are effective.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"We found that when all studies were considered, giving antibiotics beforehand may have little or no effect on uterine infections... However, when we looked only at the three highest-quality studies... we found with high certainty that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sounds contradictory. It doesn't explain *why* the conclusions are different, leaving the reader to wonder, \"So do they work or not?\"\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"When we combined all six studies, the results were uncertain. This was because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. However, when we looked only at the three strongest, high-quality studies (which included most of the women), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n\n**2. Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.**\nThe text frequently uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'treatment', 'management', 'hospitalization'), which makes sentences dense and less direct. This is confirmed by the high nominalization score.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"...prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for antibiotic **treatment** to treat **infection** and **hospitalization** for **infection treatment**...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is repetitive and abstract. Using active verbs makes it much clearer and easier to read.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection...\"\n\n**3. Complete the 'Limitations of the evidence' section.**\nThe current text misses the most critical limitations identified by the review authors, which are essential for readers to understand the certainty of the evidence.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small - participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This omits the main issues of poor follow-up and non-compliance mentioned in the abstract's conclusion. This is a factual omission.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few key reasons. In some studies, many women did not complete the follow-up appointments, and many did not take the antibiotics as instructed. This makes the results less reliable. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\"\n\n**Additional Linguistic Evaluation Summary:**\nThe linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, particularly regarding sentence length and use of active voice. However, two key metrics deviate significantly, highlighting the main areas for improvement. The 'nominalization' score is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), confirming that sentences are too noun‑heavy and should be rewritten with more direct verbs. The 'smog_index' is also high (P90), indicating that the vocabulary includes too many complex, multi‑syllable words, which should be replaced with simpler alternatives to improve readability.",
