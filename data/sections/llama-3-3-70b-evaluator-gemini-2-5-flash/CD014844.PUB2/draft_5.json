  "draft": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus (prophylactic antibiotics) can help prevent infection. \n\n- Prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection after a miscarriage, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- When we looked at the three highest-quality studies, which included 85% of all participants, we found that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss (when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation) can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus). While it's clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women with signs and symptoms of infection, it's less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are needed for those without infection signs.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to see if routine antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. They also wanted to know if prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 people. When we combined all studies, the results were uncertain. However, when we looked at the three strongest studies (including 85% of the women), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. Prophylactic antibiotics might reduce the need for more antibiotics or hospital admission for infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and meets most of our guidelines. However, it is not approved because the presentation of the main results could confuse readers. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Clarify the main finding to avoid confusion.**\nThe Key Messages and Results sections present two findings that seem to contradict each other without enough explanation. This could leave a reader unsure whether antibiotics are effective or not.\n\n- *Problematic text:*\n\"- Prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infection after a miscarriage, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- When we looked at the three highest-quality studies, which included 85% of all participants, we found that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n\n- *Why it's a problem:* Stating these two points back-to-back is confusing. The text should guide the reader toward the most reliable evidence, explaining *why* the findings differ.\n\n- *Suggested rewrite:*\nCombine these points to tell a clearer story. For example: \"Overall, the evidence for giving antibiotics was uncertain because some studies had weaknesses. However, when we looked only at the three largest and highest-quality studies (which included 85% of all women in the review), the evidence was clear: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active verbs instead of nouns.**\nThe text sometimes uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'treatment' instead of 'to treat'). This makes sentences less direct. Using more verbs would make the summary more engaging and easier to read.\n\n- *Problematic text:* \"...reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\"\n\n- *Why it's a problem:* This phrasing is noun-heavy and slightly formal. Using verbs makes the action clearer.\n\n- *Suggested rewrite:* \"...reduce the need for women to be treated with more antibiotics or be admitted to the hospital for an infection.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology for participants.**\nThe summary refer to the participants as both \"people\" and \"women\".\n\n- *Problematic text:* \"We found 6 studies involving 4371 people.\" and later \"...including 85% of the women...\"\n\n- *Why it's a problem:* Since this review is about a health issue affecting women, using \"women\" consistently is more precise and appropriate.\n\n- *Suggested rewrite:* \"We found 6 studies involving 4371 women.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns. Most metrics (72%) are in the best quartile, with excellent sentence length (18.8 words) and low passive voice (7 instances). However, the analysis identified a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 'BEYOND_P90' range at 28 instances. This supports the editorial feedback to replace noun-heavy phrases with more active verbs to improve clarity and directness."
