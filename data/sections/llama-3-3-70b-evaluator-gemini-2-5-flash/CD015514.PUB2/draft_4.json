  "draft": "Does face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment help prevent vision problems compared to other positions?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if lying face-down after eye surgery for retinal detachment can help prevent vision problems. \n\nKey messages:\n- Lying face-down after eye surgery for retinal detachment may help prevent vision problems by reducing complications like the retina moving out of place, folds forming in the retina, and double vision. However, it may also increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye.\n- We don't have clear answers yet about the best position after this surgery. This is partly because the studies so far were too small or didn't follow people for long enough.\n- Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment.\n\nWhat is a retinal detachment that involves the macula?\nA retinal detachment that involves the macula is a serious eye condition where the retina separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. To fix this, surgeons often perform a procedure called a 'pars plana vitrectomy' (a surgery where the gel-like fluid in the eye is removed and a gas bubble is inserted to help hold the retina in place while it heals).\n\nWhat is the goal of face-down positioning after surgery for this type of retinal detachment?\nAfter this eye surgery, some eye doctors recommend lying face-down to help reduce the risk of the retina moving out of place. The retina moving out of place can cause further vision problems like distorted vision and double vision. The idea behind lying face-down is to allow the gas bubble to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina helps stop the retina from moving out of place and prevents other problems. We also wanted to see if lying face-down improves vision and reduces adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing face-down positioning with other positioning methods after eye surgery. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine if face-down positioning reduces the retina moving out of place.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 368 participants with retinal detachments that involved the macula. Most studies lasted for around 6 months. In the studies we found, most of the people were men. The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning (where the head is positioned to support the location of the tear in the retina) or face-up positioning after eye surgery.\n\nWhat did the main results show?\nLying face-down immediately after surgery may reduce the retina moving out of place, folds forming in the retina, and double vision. However, it may increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye. It is unclear if lying face-down has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and potential lack of blinding. The studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of unexplained technical terms and dense, noun-heavy sentences that make the text difficult to understand, even though sentence length is good. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.** The writing often uses abstract nouns instead of direct verbs, which makes it less clear. This is reflected in the high 'nominalization' score.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is abstract and wordy. Phrases like \"positioning strategies\" are jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In the future, researchers should design studies that give us more reliable evidence. These studies should look at the benefits and harms of asking people to lie in different positions after this surgery.\"\n\n2. **Explain all technical terms.** Some research concepts are mentioned without any explanation, which will confuse readers.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and potential lack of blinding.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Lack of blinding\" is a technical term that is meaningless to most people. You need to explain what it is and why it's a limitation.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, people in the studies knew which position they were assigned to. This might have affected the results (a problem known as 'lack of blinding').\"\n\n3. **Replace jargon with simpler, everyday language.** The text uses some research-specific language that can be simplified.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Interventions and comparisons\" is clinical trial jargon. It's clearer to just describe what happened in the studies.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared people who were asked to lie face-down with people who were asked to lie in other positions (such as face-up or in a position to support the tear in the retina).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While the draft scores well on structural metrics like sentence length (18.68 words) and active voice (75%), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. Specifically, the scores for 'complex_words' (140.0), 'nominalization' (21.0), and 'smog_index' (14.22) are high, confirming that the text uses dense, technical, and noun-heavy language that could be challenging for a lay audience."
