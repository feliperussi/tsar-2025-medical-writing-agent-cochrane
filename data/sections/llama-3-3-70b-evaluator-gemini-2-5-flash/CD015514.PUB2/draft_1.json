  "draft": "# Does face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) help prevent vision problems compared to other positions?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Immediate face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) may help prevent vision problems by reducing postoperative retinal displacement (a complication where the retina moves out of place), outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia (double vision), but it may also increase the risk of raised intraocular pressure (high pressure inside the eye), although the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these effects.\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers to all questions about the best positioning after this type of surgery, partly because the studies that have been done so far have limitations, such as not including enough participants or not following them for a long enough time.\n- Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment, including how they affect quality of life and patient preferences, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best care.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?\nA macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a serious eye condition where the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is a common surgical procedure used to repair this condition.\n### What is the goal of face-down positioning after surgery for macula-involving RRD?\nAfter PPV and gas tamponade surgery for macula-involving RRD, some ophthalmologists recommend face-down positioning to help reduce the risk of retinal displacement, which can cause further vision problems such as metamorphopsia (distorted vision) and binocular diplopia (double vision). The idea behind face-down positioning is to allow the gas tamponade to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of complications.\n### What did you want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade surgery for primary macula-involving RRDs reduces the risk of retinal displacement and other complications, such as outer retinal folds and binocular diplopia, compared to other positioning methods. They also wanted to assess the effectiveness of face-down positioning in improving visual outcomes and reducing adverse events.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing face-down positioning with other positioning methods after eye surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine if face-down positioning reduces retinal displacement.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 368 participants with macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. Most studies lasted for around six months. Only one trial provided information on funding sources. The population characteristics showed that all the trials involved predominantly male participants, with a range of 68% to 72%. The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning or face-up positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade.\n### Main results: Effects of face-down positioning\nImmediate face-down positioning after surgery may result in a reduction in retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of raised intraocular pressure. It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their assigned treatment, and limited applicability since the studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues and significant deviations from plain language guidelines. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which directly violates the Master Style Guide. For example, 'Methods', 'Main results: Effects of face-down positioning', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' should all be rephrased as questions (e.g., 'How did we find the evidence?', 'What did the main results show?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', 'How up to date is this evidence?').\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Excessive Sentence Length and Complexity:** The text contains many overly long and complex sentences, making it very difficult for a patient audience to understand. \n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Immediate face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) may help prevent vision problems by reducing postoperative retinal displacement (a complication where the retina moves out of place), outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia (double vision), but it may also increase the risk of raised intraocular pressure (high pressure inside the eye), although the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these effects.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This single sentence is 69 words long and attempts to convey too many complex ideas and definitions at once, overwhelming the reader.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"After eye surgery for retinal detachment, immediate face-down positioning might help prevent vision problems. It could reduce complications like retinal displacement (when the retina moves out of place), outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia (double vision). However, it might also increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye (raised intraocular pressure). The evidence for these effects is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n2.  **Noun-Heavy and Nominalized Language:** The draft frequently uses noun forms instead of direct verbs, which makes the writing less active and harder to follow.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Immediate face-down positioning after surgery may result in a reduction in retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of raised intraocular pressure.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** Phrases like 'result in a reduction in' and 'increase the chance of' are wordy and indirect. \n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Immediate face-down positioning after surgery may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia. However, it may increase the risk of raised intraocular pressure.\"\n3.  **Overall Vocabulary Complexity:** Despite some definitions, the density of technical terms and long words throughout the text significantly hinders readability for a general audience.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The current evidence does not provide clear answers to all questions about the best positioning after this type of surgery, partly because the studies that have been done so far have limitations, such as not including enough participants or not following them for a long enough time.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** While this specific sentence is less jargon-filled, the overall text, including terms like 'macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment' and 'pars plana vitrectomy' (even with definitions), combined with complex sentence structures, makes the text very challenging. The 'Limitations' section also uses complex phrasing like 'limited applicability since the studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.'\n    *   **Suggested Action:** Conduct a systematic review of the entire text to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure. For the quoted sentence, consider: \"We don't have clear answers yet about the best position after this surgery. This is partly because the studies so far were too small or didn't follow people for long enough.\"\n4.  **Lack of White Space:** There are missing blank lines between the main title and 'Key Messages', and between 'Key Messages' and 'Introduction'.\n    *   **Why problematic:** This creates dense blocks of text, making the document visually unappealing and harder to navigate, violating the Master Style Guide's recommendation for white space.\n    *   **Suggested Action:** Add blank lines between the main title and 'Key Messages', and between 'Key Messages' and 'Introduction' to improve visual separation and readability.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis strongly supports these observations. The draft's 'words_per_sentence' (27.73) is 'BEYOND_P90', indicating sentences are far too long. 'Nominalization' (29.00) and 'nouns' (234.00) are also 'BEYOND_P90', confirming the issue with noun-heavy language. Readability indices are critically low: 'flesch_reading_ease' (31.08) is 'P10', while 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (15.81), 'gunning_fog_index' (22.08), 'smog_index' (16.78), 'dale_chall_readability' (8.36), 'automated_readability_index' (16.55), 'lix' (59.77), and 'rix' (8.88) are all rated 'P90' or 'BEYOND_P90'. This indicates the text is significantly more difficult to read than typical Plain Language Summaries. Furthermore, 'complex_words_dc' (319.00), 'complex_words' (198.00), and 'long_words' (231.00) are all 'BEYOND_P90', highlighting the need for simpler vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with only 22.2% of features falling into the best quartile and a substantial 44.4% rated 'Beyond P90' or 'Below P10'. This suggests the text is considerably more complex than expected for a Plain Language Summary. Key areas of deviation include:\n\n*   **Readability Indices:** The 'flesch_reading_ease' (31.08) is very low (P10), while 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (15.81), 'gunning_fog_index' (22.08), 'smog_index' (16.78), 'dale_chall_readability' (8.36), 'automated_readability_index' (16.55), 'lix' (59.77), and 'rix' (8.88) are all very high (P90/Beyond P90). This collectively indicates the text is much harder to read and requires a higher educational level than typical PLS documents.\n*   **Sentence Structure:** The average 'words_per_sentence' (27.73) is 'BEYOND_P90', meaning sentences are significantly longer than typical PLS patterns.\n*   **Vocabulary Complexity:** The draft shows excessive 'nominalization' (29.00, Beyond P90), 'nouns' (234.00, Beyond P90), 'complex_words' (198.00, Beyond P90), 'complex_words_dc' (319.00, Beyond P90), and 'long_words' (231.00, Beyond P90). These metrics highlight a pervasive issue with overly complex vocabulary and a lack of direct, verb-driven language.\n\nOverall, the evaluation confirms that the draft requires substantial revisions to improve clarity, simplify language, and enhance readability for its intended patient audience."
