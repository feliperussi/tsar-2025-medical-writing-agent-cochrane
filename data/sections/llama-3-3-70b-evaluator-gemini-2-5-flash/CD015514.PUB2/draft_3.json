  "draft": "Does face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment help prevent vision problems compared to other positions?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment can help prevent vision problems. \n\nKey messages:\n- Face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment might help prevent vision problems by reducing complications like retinal displacement (when the retina moves out of place), outer retinal folds, and double vision. However, it might also increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye.\n- We don't have clear answers yet about the best position after this surgery. This is partly because the studies so far were too small or didn't follow people for long enough.\n- Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment.\n\nWhat is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?\nA macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a serious eye condition where the retina separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. To fix this, surgeons often perform a procedure called a 'pars plana vitrectomy'. In this surgery, they remove the gel-like fluid in the eye and insert a gas bubble to help hold the retina in place while it heals.\n\nWhat is the goal of face-down positioning after surgery for this type of retinal detachment?\nAfter pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade surgery for this eye condition, some ophthalmologists recommend face-down positioning to help reduce the risk of retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause further vision problems like distorted vision and double vision. The idea behind face-down positioning is to allow the gas tamponade to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether face-down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade surgery for primary macula-involving retinal detachments reduces the risk of retinal displacement and other complications. We also wanted to assess the effectiveness of face-down positioning in improving visual outcomes and reducing adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing face-down positioning with other positioning methods after eye surgery. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine if face-down positioning reduces retinal displacement.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 368 participants with macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. Most studies lasted for around six months. In the studies we found, most of the people were men. The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning (where the head is positioned to support the location of the tear in the retina) or face-up positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade.\n\nWhat did the main results show?\nImmediate face-down positioning after surgery may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and double vision. However, it may increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye. It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and potential lack of blinding. The studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but the language is too technical for a general audience. The main issues are the use of unexplained jargon and complex, noun-heavy sentences that make the text difficult to understand. To improve clarity, focus on simplifying medical terms and using more direct, active verbs.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms and define all jargon.** The summary uses several medical terms that will be unfamiliar to most readers. Even if a term is common in the clinic, it should be simplified or clearly defined in a PLS.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"What is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?\" and \"...reducing complications like retinal displacement (when the retina moves out of place), outer retinal folds, and double vision.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The word 'rhegmatogenous' is jargon that will stop readers immediately. 'Outer retinal folds' is another technical term used without any explanation, which could cause confusion or anxiety.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Change the heading to \"What is a retinal detachment that involves the macula?\" and explain the other term simply: \"...reducing complications like the retina moving out of place (retinal displacement), folds forming in the retina, and double vision.\"\n\n2. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The summary often uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'reduction' instead of 'reduce'), which makes sentences more abstract and harder to follow. This is a key reason for the high complexity scores.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We aimed to determine whether face-down positioning... reduces the risk of retinal displacement and other complications.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This sentence structure is passive and noun-heavy ('determination', 'risk', 'displacement'). It buries the core action and makes the sentence feel dense.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina helps stop the retina from moving out of place and prevents other problems.\"\n\n3. **Avoid repeating long, technical names for procedures.** Once a complex procedure has been introduced, use simpler language to refer to it in subsequent sentences.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"After pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade surgery for this eye condition, some ophthalmologists recommend face-down positioning...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Repeating the full, multi-word name of the surgery makes the text feel dense and overly formal. It contributes to the high number of complex and long words.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"After this eye surgery, some eye doctors recommend lying face-down...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and passive voice are good (in the best quartile), the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including `nominalization` (28.0), `smog_index` (15.6), and `complex_words` (165.0), are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates the language is too technical and noun-heavy for a typical plain language summary, making it difficult for a general audience to read and understand."
