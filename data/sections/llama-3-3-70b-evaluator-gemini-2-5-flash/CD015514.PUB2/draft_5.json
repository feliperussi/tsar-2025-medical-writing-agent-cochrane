  "draft": "Does face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment help prevent vision problems compared to other positions?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if lying face-down after eye surgery for retinal detachment can help prevent vision problems. \n\nKey messages:\n- Lying face-down after eye surgery for retinal detachment may help prevent vision problems by reducing complications like the retina moving out of place, folds forming in the retina, and double vision. However, it may also increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye.\n- We don't have clear answers yet about the best position after this surgery. This is partly because the studies so far were too small or didn't follow people for long enough.\n- Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment.\n\nWhat is a retinal detachment that involves the macula?\nA retinal detachment that involves the macula is a serious eye condition where the retina separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. To fix this, surgeons often perform a procedure called a 'pars plana vitrectomy' (a surgery where the gel-like fluid in the eye is removed and a gas bubble is inserted to help hold the retina in place while it heals).\n\nWhat is the goal of face-down positioning after surgery for this type of retinal detachment?\nAfter this eye surgery, some eye doctors recommend lying face-down to help reduce the risk of the retina moving out of place. The retina moving out of place can cause further vision problems like distorted vision and double vision. The idea behind lying face-down is to allow the gas bubble to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina helps stop the retina from moving out of place and prevents other problems. We also wanted to see if lying face-down improves vision and reduces adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing face-down positioning with other positioning methods after eye surgery. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine if face-down positioning reduces the retina moving out of place.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 368 participants with retinal detachments that involved the macula. Most studies lasted for around 6 months. In the studies we found, most of the people were men. The studies compared people who were asked to lie face-down with people who were asked to lie in other positions (such as face-up or in a position to support the tear in the retina).\n\nWhat did the main results show?\nLying face-down immediately after surgery may reduce the retina moving out of place, folds forming in the retina, and double vision. However, it may increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye. It is unclear if lying face-down has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, people in the studies knew which position they were assigned to. This might have affected the results (a problem known as 'lack of blinding'). The studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\nIn the future, researchers should design studies that give us more reliable evidence. These studies should look at the benefits and harms of asking people to lie in different positions after this surgery. They should also examine how these positions affect quality of life and patient preferences, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best care.",

To improve clarity for patients, please focus on the following 3 areas:\n\n1. **Simplify the introduction of technical terms.** The opening paragraph introduces several complex concepts at once, which can be overwhelming for a reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"A retinal detachment that involves the macula is a serious eye condition where the retina separates from the underlying tissue.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This sentence front-loads multiple technical terms ('macula', 'retina', 'underlying tissue').\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of your eye. Sometimes, it can pull away from the tissue that supports it. This is called a retinal detachment. If the detachment affects the macula—the part of the retina you use for sharp, central vision—it is a medical emergency.\"\n\n2. **Replace abstract nouns with more concrete language.** The limitations section uses research jargon that is not meaningful to most patients.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This sentence is full of abstract nouns ('populations', 'interventions', 'comparators') that obscure the practical meaning of the limitation.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies were limited because they did not include a wide variety of people and mostly focused on men. We also need more research comparing different patient positions and looking at how the surgery affects people's daily lives.\"\n\n3. **Clarify research concepts like 'blinding'.** The explanation for why 'lack of blinding' is a problem could be more explicit for a lay reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Also, people in the studies knew which position they were assigned to. This might have affected the results (a problem known as 'lack of blinding').\"\n   - **Reasoning:** It's not immediately clear to a patient *how* knowing their position could affect the results.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, people in the studies knew which position they were asked to lie in. Knowing this could change how they report their symptoms, which might affect the study's results. This is a common challenge in this type of research and is known as 'lack of blinding'.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help address the high number of complex words and nouns identified in the linguistic analysis, making the summary much easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. While sentence-level metrics like length and active voice are excellent (most are in the best quartile), word-level complexity metrics deviate significantly from typical PLS patterns. Specifically, the counts for nouns, complex words, and nominalizations are beyond the 90th percentile. This suggests that while sentences are well-structured, the vocabulary within them is too technical and abstract for a lay audience, which is also reflected in the high SMOG index (P90)."
