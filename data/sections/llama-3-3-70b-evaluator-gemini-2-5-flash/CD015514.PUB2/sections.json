  "key_messages": [
    "Immediate face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) may help prevent vision problems by reducing postoperative retinal displacement (a complication where the retina moves out of place), outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia (double vision), but it may also increase the risk of raised intraocular pressure (high pressure inside the eye), although the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these effects.",
    "The current evidence does not provide clear answers to all questions about the best positioning after this type of surgery, partly because the studies that have been done so far have limitations, such as not including enough participants or not following them for a long enough time.",
    "Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment, including how they affect quality of life and patient preferences, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best care."

      "subheading": "What is a macula-involving rheÂ rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?",
      "content": "A macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a serious eye condition where the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is a common surgical procedure used to repair this condition."

      "subheading": "What is the goal of face-down positioning after surgery for macula-involving RRD?",
      "content": "After PPV and gas tamponade surgery for macula-involving RRD, some ophthalmologists recommend face-down positioning to help reduce the risk of retinal displacement, which can cause further vision problems such as metamorphopsia (distorted vision) and binocular diplopia (double vision). The idea behind face-down positioning is to allow the gas tamponade to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of complications."

    {
      "subheading": "What did you want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine whether face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade surgery for primary macula-involving RRDs reduces the risk of retinal displacement and other complications, such as outer retinal folds and binocular diplopia, compared to other positioning methods. They also wanted to assess the effectiveness of face-down positioning in improving visual outcomes and reducing adverse events."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found three studies that involved 368 participants with macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. Most studies lasted for around six months. Only one trial provided information on funding sources. The population characteristics showed that all the trials involved predominantly male participants, with a range of 68% to 72%. The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning or face-up positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effects of face-down positioning",
      "content": "Immediate face-down positioning after surgery may result in a reduction in retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of raised intraocular pressure. It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their assigned treatment, and limited applicability since the studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.",
