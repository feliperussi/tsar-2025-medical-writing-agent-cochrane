  "draft": "Does face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment help prevent vision problems compared to other positions?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment can help prevent vision problems. \n\nKey messages:\n- Face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment might help prevent vision problems by reducing complications like retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and double vision. However, it might also increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye.\n- We don't have clear answers yet about the best position after this surgery. This is partly because the studies so far were too small or didn't follow people for long enough.\n- Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment.\n\nWhat is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?\nA macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a serious eye condition where the retina separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. A common surgical procedure used to repair this condition is pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade.\n\nWhat is the goal of face-down positioning after surgery for macula-involving RRD?\nAfter pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade surgery for macula-involving RRD, some ophthalmologists recommend face-down positioning to help reduce the risk of retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause further vision problems like distorted vision and double vision. The idea behind face-down positioning is to allow the gas tamponade to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether face-down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade surgery for primary macula-involving RRDs reduces the risk of retinal displacement and other complications. We also wanted to assess the effectiveness of face-down positioning in improving visual outcomes and reducing adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing face-down positioning with other positioning methods after eye surgery. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine if face-down positioning reduces retinal displacement.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 368 participants with macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. Most studies lasted for around six months. The population characteristics showed that all the trials involved predominantly male participants. The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning or face-up positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade.\n\nWhat did the main results show?\nImmediate face-down positioning after surgery may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and double vision. However, it may increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye. It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and potential lack of blinding. The studies do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start. The summary is factually accurate, well-structured, and within the word count limit. However, it needs significant improvement in clarity to be accessible for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of unexplained technical terms and overly complex vocabulary, which make the text difficult to understand. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer for patients and their families.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Explain Key Surgical Terms in Simple Language**\n\nSome essential surgical terms are mentioned but never explained, which will leave readers confused about the treatment itself.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"A common surgical procedure used to repair this condition is pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade.\" and \"...compared with support-the-break positioning...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Patients won't know what these procedures involve. Without a basic understanding of the surgery, the advice about positioning afterwards lacks context.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n  - For the surgery: \"To fix this, surgeons often perform a procedure called a 'pars plana vitrectomy'. In this surgery, they remove the gel-like fluid in the eye and insert a gas bubble to help hold the retina in place while it heals.\"\n  - For the positioning: \"...compared with 'support-the-break' positioning (where the head is positioned to support the location of the tear in the retina).\"\n\n**2. Simplify the Main Condition's Name After Defining It**\n\nThe full name of the condition is very long and technical. It's good to define it once, but repeating it makes the text dense and hard to read.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** The repeated use of \"macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment\" throughout the summary.\n- **Why it's a problem:** This intimidating phrase makes sentences clunky and difficult to follow. Once defined, a simpler placeholder is more effective.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** After defining it in the first section, use simpler terms like \"this type of retinal detachment\" or \"this eye condition\" in the rest of the summary.\n\n**3. Replace Formal, Academic Phrasing with Everyday Language**\n\nMany sentences are written in a formal, scientific style rather than in plain language. This makes the text feel distant and hard to process.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"The population characteristics showed that all the trials involved predominantly male participants.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"population characteristics\" and \"predominantly\" are academic jargon. This style creates a barrier for readers.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In the studies we found, most of the people were men.\"\n\nBy making these changes, you will significantly improve the readability and usefulness of this summary for your target audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show a mixed picture. While the summary has excellent structural features like short sentences (words_per_sentence in the best 25% of PLS) and high use of active voice, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary. The metrics for 'complex_words' and the 'smog_index' are 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the word choice is far more complex than is typical for a PLS. This is supported by high scores for 'long_words', 'nominalization', and 'nouns' (all in the P90 range). This data confirms the editorial feedback: the summary's main weakness is its overly technical and academic language, which needs to be simplified to improve readability."
