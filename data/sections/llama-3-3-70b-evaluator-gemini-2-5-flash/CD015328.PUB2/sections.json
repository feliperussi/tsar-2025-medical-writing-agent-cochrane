  "key_messages": [
    "School-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up, with little to no difference found for dietary interventions alone, and no reported harmful effects.",
    "Dietary and activity interventions may result in a slight reduction in body mass index (BMI) (a measure of body fat based on height and weight) and zBMI score (a measure of BMI that takes into account age and sex) at short- and medium-term follow-up, but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, including the lack of evidence for home and community-based settings, the exclusion of children with disabilities, and the need for longer-term follow-up to fully understand the effects of these interventions on obesity in childhood."

      "subheading": "What is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Childhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being."

      "subheading": "What are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?",
      "content": "Common approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can help reduce health inequalities."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review includes 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings, with the majority (111 studies) taking place in schools, followed by community (15 studies), home (8 studies), and clinical settings (7 studies). One study was conducted via telehealth, and 31 studies were conducted in multiple settings. The duration of the interventions varied, with 86 studies lasting less than nine months, and the longest study lasting four years. Non-industry funding was declared by 132 studies, while 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry. The studies focused on children aged 5 to 11 years, with 146 studies based in high-income countries. The interventions included dietary, activity, or combined dietary and activity interventions, with the aim of preventing obesity in children. The studies compared these interventions to no intervention, usual care, or other eligible interventions. Interventions to prevent obesity in children may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. It is unclear if interventions have an effect on severe adverse events and health inequalities."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, heterogeneity in participant populations and intervention delivery, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
