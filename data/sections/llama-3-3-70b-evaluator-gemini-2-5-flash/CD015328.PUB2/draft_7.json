  "draft": "What are the best ways to help children aged 5 to 11 years old avoid becoming overweight or obese (a condition where someone is heavily overweight, which can lead to health problems)?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- School-based 'activity' interventions, sometimes combined with diet changes, might slightly help prevent childhood obesity in the short and medium term. However, these effects don't last long. Diet interventions alone showed little to no difference, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Combined diet and activity interventions might slightly reduce BMI (body mass index, a measure of body fat) and zBMI score (BMI adjusted for age and sex) in the short and medium term. However, we are not certain about these effects due to the low quality of the evidence.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, including the lack of evidence for home and community-based settings, the exclusion of children with disabilities, and the need for longer-term follow-up to fully understand the effects of these interventions on obesity in childhood.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being.\n\n### What are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?\nCommon approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can help reduce health inequalities.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies on preventing obesity in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of dietary and activity interventions.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nThis review includes 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants. \nThe studies were conducted in various settings, with the majority taking place in schools, followed by community, home, and clinical settings. \nOne study was conducted via telehealth, and 31 studies were conducted in multiple settings.\n\nThe duration of the interventions varied, with 86 studies lasting less than nine months, and the longest study lasting four years. \nNon-industry funding was declared by 132 studies, while 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry.\n\nThe studies focused on children aged 5 to 11 years, with 146 studies based in high-income countries. \nThe interventions included dietary, activity, or combined dietary and activity interventions, with the aim of preventing obesity in children.\n\nInterventions to prevent obesity in children may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. \nDietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. \nIt is unclear if interventions have an effect on severe adverse events and health inequalities.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes, differences in the children who took part and how the interventions were delivered, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The writing is more academic than a typical Plain Language Summary, with too much passive voice and complex vocabulary. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Use active voice to make the text more direct.** The results section relies heavily on passive constructions, which can make it feel distant and hard to read. The style guide recommends using the active voice.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies were conducted in various settings... One study was conducted via telehealth, and 31 studies were conducted in multiple settings.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Researchers conducted the studies in various settings... One study used telehealth, and 31 used multiple settings.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex words and noun-heavy phrases.** The text contains many long words and formal phrases that can be replaced with simpler, more common alternatives. This will make the summary much easier for readers to understand quickly.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The duration of the interventions varied... Non-industry funding was declared by 132 studies...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The programs lasted for different amounts of time... For 132 studies, the funding came from sources other than industry...\"\n\n3. **Maintain a consistent and personal tone.** The Methods section correctly uses \"We\" to refer to the review authors, but the Results section switches to an impersonal tone (\"This review includes...\"). Using \"we\" consistently makes the summary more engaging.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This review includes 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While several readability scores fall within the best quartile (Flesch-Kincaid Grade = 11.5), the draft deviates significantly in key areas related to vocabulary and sentence structure. Six metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-typical complexity. Specifically, the high counts for passive voice (19), complex words (125), and long words (205) support the need to simplify sentence constructions and word choices to improve readability for a general audience."
