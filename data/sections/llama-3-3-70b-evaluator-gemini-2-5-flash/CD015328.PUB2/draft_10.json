  "draft": "What are the best ways to help children aged 5 to 11 years old avoid becoming overweight or obese?\nWe found that school-based programs to increase physical activity, with or without diet changes, may help prevent children from becoming overweight for up to 15 months. However, these effects may not last. Programs that focused only on diet made little to no difference. We are uncertain if these programs cause any serious harmful effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being.\n\nWhat are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?\nCommon approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can help reduce health inequalities.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies on preventing obesity in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of dietary and activity interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies that included 189,707 children. Most of these programs took place in schools and were not funded by industry. Our main finding is that programs to increase physical activity may help prevent children from becoming overweight for up to 15 months, but these effects may not last. Programs that focused only on diet made little to no difference. We are uncertain if these programs cause any serious harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. Many studies were small, and the programs were run in very different ways. In many studies, families knew which program they were in, and this knowledge could have influenced the results. Finally, some studies did not report all their findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nTo improve the evidence, future studies should:\n- Test programs in homes and communities, not just schools.\n- Include children with disabilities.\n- Follow children for a longer time to see if the effects of the programs last.",

However, it is not approved because it needs a few revisions to meet all style guide requirements and improve clarity for the reader.\n\n1. **Subheading Format:** One subheading does not follow the required question format.\n    *   **Text:** 'To improve the evidence, future studies should:'\n    *   **Issue:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change this to a question, such as 'What research is still needed?'\n\n2. **Redundant Content:** The main findings are stated in the introductory summary and then repeated almost word-for-word in the 'What did we find?' section.\n    *   **Text:** The sentence 'Our main finding is that programs to increase physical activity may help prevent children from becoming overweight...' in the results section is nearly identical to the summary in the first paragraph.\n    *   **Issue:** This repetition makes the summary less impactful and the results section feel redundant.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please remove the repeated summary sentence from the 'What did we find?' section. That section should focus on presenting the details, like the number of studies and participants, which supports the main finding already stated at the beginning.\n\n3. **Clarify Technical Concepts:** The explanation of a key limitation could be clearer for a non-scientific audience.\n    *   **Text:** 'In many studies, families knew which program they were in, and this knowledge could have influenced the results.'\n    *   **Issue:** This sentence doesn't explain *how* this knowledge could influence the results, which may confuse readers.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please add a brief explanation. For example: 'In many studies, families knew which program they were in. This knowledge could have influenced their behavior (for example, by trying harder if they were in the program group), which could affect the results. This is a potential source of bias.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent readability. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 8.7 (P25) and the average sentence length is 15.7 words (P25), both of which are ideal. The feedback provided focuses on structural issues, adherence to style guide rules, and clarity of concepts, which are areas not fully captured by the statistical metrics."
