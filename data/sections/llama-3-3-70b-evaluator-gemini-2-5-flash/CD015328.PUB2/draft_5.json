  "draft": "What are effective strategies to prevent overweight and obesity in children aged 5-11?\n\nKey messages:\n- School-based activity programs, either alone or combined with diet changes, may have a small benefit for children's weight in the short and medium term. Importantly, these programs did not appear to cause any serious harmful effects.\n- Programs combining diet and activity likely cause a small reduction in measures of body fat after about a year (moderate-certainty evidence). The effect after only a few months is less clear (low-certainty evidence).\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions, as well as their impact on children with disabilities and from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being.\n\nWhat are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?\nTo prevent childhood obesity, common approaches are to help children eat healthier and be more active. This can mean eating less sugar and fat, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. We also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can help reduce health inequalities.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nTo find all relevant studies, our research team searched major medical research databases for trials that tested programs to prevent obesity in children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe have some concerns about the evidence. The programs in the studies were all very different, which makes it difficult to compare them directly. In most studies, families knew which program their child was in, which could have influenced the results. Because of these issues, our confidence in the findings is reduced.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies that included a total of 189,707 children. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. The programs varied in length from a single session to four years. Most were funded by non-industry sources. Our review found that school-based activity programs, either by themselves or with diet changes, may have a small benefit on children's weight in the short and medium term. However, we did not see this benefit in the long term. Programs that focused only on diet changes seemed to make little to no difference.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
