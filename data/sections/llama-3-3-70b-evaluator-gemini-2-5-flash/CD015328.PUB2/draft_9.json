  "draft": "What are the best ways to help children aged 5 to 11 years old avoid becoming overweight or obese? \nWe found that school-based 'activity' interventions, sometimes combined with diet changes, might slightly help prevent childhood obesity in the short and medium term. However, these effects don't last long. \nDiet interventions alone seemed to make little to no difference. There was not enough evidence to be sure about harmful effects. \nCombined diet and activity interventions might slightly reduce BMI (body mass index, a measure of body fat) and zBMI score (BMI adjusted for age and sex) in the short and medium term. However, we are not certain about these effects due to the low quality of the evidence.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem? \nChildhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being.\n\nWhat are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity? \nCommon approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can help reduce health inequalities.\n\nHow did we conduct this review? \nWe searched for studies on preventing obesity in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of dietary and activity interventions.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 172 studies that included 189,707 children. Most of these programs took place in schools and were not funded by industry. \nOur main finding is that programs to increase physical activity may help prevent children from becoming overweight for up to 15 months, but these effects may not last. \nPrograms that focused only on diet made little to no difference. We are uncertain if these programs cause any serious harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. Many studies were small, and the programs were run in very different ways. In many studies, families knew which program they were in (which is called a 'lack of blinding'), and this knowledge could have influenced the results. Finally, some studies did not report all their findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nFuture research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, including the lack of evidence for home and community-based settings, the exclusion of children with disabilities, and the need for longer-term follow-up to fully understand the effects of these interventions on obesity in childhood.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-written in many places. However, a few key improvements are needed to make the main findings easier for readers to understand and act upon. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Restructure the Key Messages for Clarity:** The main findings are currently spread across the first four paragraphs, with some repetition. This makes it hard for a reader to quickly grasp the most important takeaways. \n   - **Problematic Text:** The section from \"We found that school-based...\" to \"...low quality of the evidence.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Combine these points into a clear, scannable list under a single heading like \"What we found\". For example:\n     \"- School programs that increase physical activity, with or without diet changes, may help prevent children from becoming overweight for up to 15 months. However, these effects may not last.\n     - Programs that focused only on diet made little to no difference.\n     - We are uncertain if these programs cause any serious harmful effects because the evidence is limited.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the Final Paragraph on Future Research:** The last paragraph is one long sentence that contains complex words and ideas, making it difficult to read.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, including the lack of evidence for home and community-based settings, the exclusion of children with disabilities, and the need for longer-term follow-up to fully understand the effects of these interventions on obesity in childhood.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Break this sentence into a simple, bulleted list so readers can easily see what needs to happen next. For example:\n     \"To improve the evidence, future studies should:\n     - Test programs in homes and communities, not just schools.\n     - Include children with disabilities.\n     - Follow children for a longer time to see if the effects of the programs last.\"\n\n3. **Use Simpler and More Consistent Language:** The draft sometimes uses technical phrasing where simpler terms would be clearer. \n   - **Problematic Text 1:** The term \"'activity' interventions\" is used in the key messages.\n   - **Suggestion 1:** Replace this with \"physical activity programs\" or \"programs to increase activity\" throughout the summary for consistency and clarity.\n   - **Problematic Text 2:** The definition for BMI is \"a measure of body fat\".\n   - **Suggestion 2:** This is slightly inaccurate. A more helpful definition for parents would be: \"...BMI (body mass index, a measure calculated from a child's height and weight)...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and simplicity. However, the analysis identified a high number of long words (P90), which supports the recommendation to simplify complex sentences, particularly the final paragraph. Other metrics like passive voice are on the higher end of the typical range (P75), suggesting minor opportunities for improvement in sentence structure."
