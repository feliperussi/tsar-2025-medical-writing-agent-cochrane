  "draft": "What are effective strategies to prevent overweight and obesity in children aged 5-11?\n\nKey messages:\n- School-based activity interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up.\n- Dietary and activity interventions may result in a slight reduction in body mass index (BMI) and zBMI score at short- and medium-term follow-up, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of the effects.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions, as well as their impact on children with disabilities and from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being.\n\nWhat are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?\nCommon approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can help reduce health inequalities.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe conducted systematic searches of electronic databases for studies evaluating interventions aimed at preventing obesity in children. Search terms combined concepts of \"obesity\", \"children\", \"prevention\", \"dietary\", and \"physical activity\".\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies involved heterogeneous populations and delivery methods, were very small, were likely unblinded, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings, with the majority taking place in schools, followed by community, home, and clinical settings. The duration of the interventions varied, with 86 studies lasting less than nine months, and the longest study lasting four years. Non-industry funding was declared by 132 studies, while 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry. The studies focused on children aged 5 to 11 years, with 146 studies based in high-income countries. The interventions involved dietary changes, activity levels, or a combination of both, aiming to prevent obesity in children. The review found that school-based activity interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. The evidence suggests that these interventions may reduce the risk of obesity in children, but the effects are generally small and the results are not consistent across all studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of undefined technical terms in the key messages, complex language in the limitations section, and the omission of important safety information. Addressing these points will make the summary much more accessible and useful for patients and their families.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define technical terms in the Key Messages.** The terms BMI and zBMI are crucial but are not explained upfront, which can confuse readers from the start.\n    - **Original Text:** \"Dietary and activity interventions may result in a slight reduction in body mass index (BMI) and zBMI score at short- and medium-term follow-up...\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Dietary and activity programs may lead to a small reduction in body mass index (BMI), a measure of body fat based on height and weight, and zBMI score, which adjusts BMI for a child's age and sex.\"\n\n2. **Include key safety findings.** The summary omits the important finding that the interventions did not cause serious harm, which is a critical piece of information for parents and caregivers.\n    - **Original Text:** \"School-based activity interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up.\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"School-based activity programs, either alone or combined with diet changes, may have a small benefit for children's weight in the short and medium term. Importantly, these programs did not appear to cause any serious harmful effects.\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex language in the limitations section.** The current wording uses jargon that is difficult for a non-medical audience to understand.\n    - **Original Text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies involved heterogeneous populations and delivery methods, were very small, were likely unblinded, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies included a wide mix of children and used many different ways to run the programs, making them hard to compare. Also, many studies were small, and the people involved often knew which program they were in, which can affect the results.\"\n\n4. **Use more direct, everyday language.** Some sentences are wordy and use noun-heavy phrases instead of simpler verbs, making them harder to read.\n    - **Original Text:** \"Common approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption...\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To prevent childhood obesity, common approaches are to help children eat healthier and be more active. This can mean eating less sugar and fat...\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most readability and sentence structure metrics falling within the median range. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in five key areas related to vocabulary complexity. The draft has a high number of nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words (7+ characters). This results in a high SMOG index (13.7), suggesting the text is more difficult to read than a typical PLS and supports the need to simplify technical terms and complex phrasing."
