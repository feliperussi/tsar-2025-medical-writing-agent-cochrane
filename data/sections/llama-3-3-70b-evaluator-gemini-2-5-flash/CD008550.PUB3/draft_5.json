  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children?\n\nKey Messages\n- We don't know for sure how well medicines work for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux.\n- There is not enough good evidence to know if specific drugs—like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or other proton pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce stomach acid)—are helpful.\n- For children with more severe reflux (called GORD), it's also unclear if these medicines help. GORD is when reflux causes symptoms bad enough to need treatment. More research is needed to know for sure.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) happens when what's in the stomach comes back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). This can cause symptoms like spitting up (regurgitation). It's a common problem in infants, affecting about 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience symptoms that last longer, especially if they have other health problems.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. We need to distinguish between GOR and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). When reflux causes symptoms bad enough to need treatment, it is called GORD. Guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say it is important to treat GORD.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nMedicines, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work for treating GOR in children, including their benefits and harms. We looked at which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that tested medicines for reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. These studies were conducted in various countries, though specific locations were not detailed. Most studies lasted around two weeks, with some extending up to several months. The funding sources were not explicitly stated.\n\nThe studies included infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old, with some focusing on specific age groups like neonates. Interventions included medicines such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors, compared to a placebo or other medications.\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn't enough data to assess other medications. More studies with longer follow-up are needed, especially for groups like preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities.\n\nOverall, the evidence was not strong enough to show if medicines help infants or older children with reflux. For specific drugs like omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors, we could not find clear evidence that they improve symptoms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nFuture research should look at the long-term effects of these medicines. We need to understand their benefits and harms for different groups, like premature babies or children with disabilities. This will help families and doctors make better decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because there are a few key areas where simplifying technical language and removing unnecessary details would significantly improve clarity for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the technical language in the limitations section.**\n   - **Problem:** The current text uses research jargon that is difficult for patients to understand.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were small and did not look at all the different types of children, medicines, or results that are important to families.\"\n\n2. **Remove unnecessary process details from the results.**\n   - **Problem:** Details about study administration are not relevant to the key findings for patients and can be distracting.\n   - **Original sentences:** \"These studies were conducted in various countries, though specific locations were not detailed... The funding sources were not explicitly stated.\"\n   - **Suggested action:** Remove these two sentences. They do not add to the reader's understanding of the review's conclusions.\n\n3. **Make phrasing more direct and patient-focused.**\n   - **Problem:** Some sentences are written from a researcher's perspective, which can feel indirect to a patient.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We need to distinguish between GOR and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It's important to know the difference between simple reflux (GOR) and a more severe form called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found that the draft has a high number of complex and long words for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these specific sentences will help make the summary more accessible and easier to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with most readability and structure metrics falling within the best quartile. However, the analysis identified deviations in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words are in the P90 range, indicating that the text contains more complex vocabulary and noun-heavy phrases than is typical. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical jargon and rephrase sentences to be more direct."
