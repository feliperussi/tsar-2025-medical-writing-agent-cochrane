  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children?\n\nKey Messages\n- We don't know for sure how well medicines work for children with reflux, as there is not enough good evidence to know if specific drugs like proton pump inhibitors (which reduce stomach acid) are helpful.\n- For infants and children with GORD (reflux severe enough to need treatment), it is uncertain if medicines provide any benefit. More research is needed to know for sure.\n- More research is needed on the long-term effects of these medicines, especially for groups like premature babies or children with disabilities.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) happens when what's in the stomach comes back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). This can cause symptoms like spitting up (regurgitation). It's a common problem in infants, affecting about 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience symptoms that last longer, especially if they have other health problems.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. Health experts recommend treating reflux when symptoms are severe. This is known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or GORD.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nMedicines, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work for treating GOR in children, including their benefits and harms. We looked at which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that tested medicines for reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies included infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old, with some focusing on specific age groups like neonates. Interventions included medicines such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors, compared to a placebo or other medications.\n\nOverall, we did not find strong enough evidence to show whether medicines help infants or older children with reflux. For example, there was no clear evidence that commonly used drugs like omeprazole improved symptoms any more than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and did not look at all the different types of children, medicines, or results that are important to families.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nFuture research should look at the long-term effects of these medicines. We need to understand their benefits and harms for different groups, like premature babies or children with disabilities. This will help families and doctors make better decisions.",
