  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines for gastro-oesophageal reflux (when stomach contents flow back into the food pipe) in children?\n\nKey Messages\n- There is not enough high-quality evidence for us to know for sure how well medicines work for children with reflux. This is because the certainty of the evidence is very low, making it uncertain if drugs like proton pump inhibitors (which reduce stomach acid) are helpful.\n- For infants and children with GORD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, a condition where reflux causes symptoms severe enough to merit treatment), it is uncertain if medicines provide any benefit. More research is needed to know for sure.\n- More research is needed on the long-term effects of these medicines, especially for groups like premature babies or children with disabilities.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) happens when what's in the stomach comes back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). This can cause symptoms like spitting up (regurgitation). It's a common problem in infants, affecting about 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience symptoms that last longer, especially if they have other health problems.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. Health experts recommend treating reflux when symptoms are severe. This is known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or GORD.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nMedicines, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work for treating GOR in children, including their benefits and harms. We looked at which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that tested medicines for reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies tested medicines like omeprazole, esomeprazole, and ranitidine against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medicines. We found that medications may or may not provide a benefit for infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux, and there is no clear evidence to support the use of specific medications such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, or proton pump inhibitors. In older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nFuture research should look at the long-term effects of these medicines. We need to understand their benefits and harms for different groups, like premature babies or children with disabilities. This will help families and doctors make better decisions.",

However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the first Key Message for clarity and impact.** The current version is repetitive.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"There is not enough high-quality evidence for us to know for sure how well medicines work for children with reflux. This is because the certainty of the evidence is very low, making it uncertain if drugs like proton pump inhibitors (which reduce stomach acid) are helpful.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are very uncertain about how well medicines, like those that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors), work for children with reflux. The evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure.\"\n\n2. **Break up the long, complex sentence in the main results.** This will make the key finding easier to understand.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We found that medications may or may not provide a benefit for infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux, and there is no clear evidence to support the use of specific medications such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, or proton pump inhibitors.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For infants, we found that medicines may or may not help with reflux symptoms. There was no clear evidence that specific drugs like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or other proton pump inhibitors.\"\n\n3. **Replace technical jargon in the 'Limitations' section.** The current wording is aimed at researchers, not patients.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low because most of the studies were small. They also didn't look at all the different types of children, treatments, or results that are important to families.\"\n\n4. **Add a subheading to the final paragraph.** The information about future research currently feels disconnected from the rest of the summary.\n   - **Problematic text:** The final paragraph beginning \"Future research should look at...\" has no heading.\n   - **Suggested action:** Add a new subheading above this paragraph, such as \"What research is needed next?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. The text has excellent readability scores, short sentences, and appropriate use of active voice. The only minor deviation is a slightly high noun count (162, placing it in the P90 range), which supports the editorial feedback to rephrase some noun-heavy sentences to be more direct and verb-focused."
