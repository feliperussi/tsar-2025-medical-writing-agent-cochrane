  "draft": "# What are the effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children?\n**Key Messages**\n- The effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children are not clearly understood, and there is no strong evidence to support the use of specific medications, including omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce stomach acid production), due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Medicines may or may not provide a benefit for infants and children with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), a condition where gastro-oesophageal reflux causes symptoms severe enough to merit treatment, and further research is needed to determine their effectiveness.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these medications and their potential benefits and harms in different subgroups of children, such as preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities, to provide more accurate and reliable information for decision-making.\n**Introduction**\n### What is gastro‐oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a condition where the stomach contents flow back up into the oesophagus, causing symptoms such as regurgitation. It is a common problem in infants, affecting approximately 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, particularly if they have other medical conditions.\n### Why is gastro‐oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. The distinction between GOR and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is important, as GORD is defined as GOR that causes symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Current guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasize the need for effective management of GORD.\n### What are the common treatments for gastro‐oesophageal reflux in children?\nPharmacological treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H₂ antagonists, are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for GOR in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications, and to identify any potential harms associated with these treatments.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, although the specific locations were not detailed. Most studies lasted for around two weeks, with some lasting up to several months. The funding sources for the studies were not explicitly stated. The population characteristics included infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old, with some studies focusing on specific age groups such as neonates. The study settings were not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they took place in primary and secondary care settings. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological treatments such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors, compared to placebo or other medications. Unfortunately, there were insufficient summary data to assess other medications, and further studies with longer follow-up are needed, particularly in subgroups such as preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities. The review found that medications may or may not provide a benefit for infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux, and there is no clear evidence to support the use of specific medications such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, or proton pump inhibitors. In older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these medications.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to a critical formatting issue and several significant clarity and style problems that hinder readability for a patient audience. The 'Methods' subheading is not phrased as a question, violating the style guide. Additionally, the 'What did we find?' section is a single, overly long paragraph, making it difficult to read. The first key message contains a redundant definition, adding unnecessary length. The text also exhibits a pattern of nominalization and noun-heavy phrasing, contributing to overall complexity.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** The subheading '### Methods' is not phrased as a question, which violates the Master Style Guide. All subheadings should be questions where possible.\n\n**Top 4 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Clarity/Structure: Overly long paragraph in Results section.**\n    *   **Specific Quote:** \"We found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, although the specific locations were not detailed. Most studies lasted for around two weeks, with some lasting up to several months. The funding sources for the studies were not explicitly stated. The population characteristics included infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old, with some studies focusing on specific age groups such as neonates. The study settings were not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they took place in primary and secondary care settings. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological treatments such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors, compared to placebo or other medications.

In older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these medications.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This entire 'What did we find?' section is presented as a single, very long paragraph (180 words). This 'wall of text' is overwhelming for readers, making it extremely difficult to process and extract key information. It significantly contributes to high scores in metrics like `words_per_sentence`, `smog_index`, `complex_words`, `long_words`, and `nouns`.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Break this section into several shorter, more digestible paragraphs. For example:\n        *   \"We found 36 studies involving 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. These studies were conducted in various countries, though specific locations were not detailed. Most studies lasted around two weeks, with some extending up to several months.

More research is needed to confirm how effective these medicines are.\"\n2.  **Clarity/Style: Redundant definition in Key Messages.**\n    *   **Specific Quote:** \"The effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children are not clearly understood, and there is no strong evidence to support the use of specific medications, including omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce stomach acid production), due to a lack of robust evidence.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** The definition of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is already provided in the main title. Repeating it here makes an already long key message even longer and more cumbersome, hindering immediate understanding. This contributes to the high `words_per_sentence` metric.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in children are not clearly understood. There is no strong evidence to support the use of specific medications, including omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are medicines that reduce stomach acid production, because of a lack of robust evidence.\"\n3.  **Structure: Subheading not a question.**\n    *   **Specific Quote:** \"### Methods\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** The Master Style Guide explicitly states that subheadings should be phrased as questions where possible to improve readability and guide the reader. This is a critical formatting requirement.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Change to \"### How did we do the review?\" or \"### What did we do?\"\n4.  **Style/Clarity: High nominalization and noun-heavy phrasing.**\n    *   **Specific Quote:** \"The distinction between GOR and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is important, as GORD is defined as GOR that causes symptoms severe enough to require treatment.\" and \"Current guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasize the need for effective management of GORD.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** Using noun forms like 'distinction' and 'management' instead of their verb counterparts ('distinguish,' 'manage') makes sentences less direct and increases their cognitive load. This contributes to the high `nominalization` and `nouns` metrics, making the text feel more academic and less plain language.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** For the first quote: \"It is important to distinguish between GOR and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD is defined as GOR that causes symptoms severe enough to require treatment.\" For the second quote: \"Current guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasize that GORD needs to be managed effectively.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling within the best quartile. However, a significant portion of metrics (22.2%) deviate beyond the 90th percentile, indicating areas where the text is notably more complex than typical plain language summaries. Specifically, `nominalization` (24.0, P90), `complex_words` (141.0, P90), `nouns` (227.0, BEYOND_P90), `smog_index` (14.92, BEYOND_P90), `complex_words_dc` (308.0, BEYOND_P90), and `long_words` (244.0, BEYOND_P90) are all higher than typical. This suggests the draft is more noun-heavy, uses more complex and long words, and is generally harder to read (as indicated by the high SMOG index) than ideal for a plain language summary. These metric deviations strongly support the editorial feedback regarding long sentences, nominalization, and dense paragraphs."
