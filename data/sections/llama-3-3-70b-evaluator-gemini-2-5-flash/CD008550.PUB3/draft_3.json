  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children?\n\nKey Messages\n- We don't know for sure how well medicines work for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux. \n- There is not enough good evidence to know if specific drugs—like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or other proton pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce stomach acid)—are helpful.\n- For children with more severe reflux (called GORD), it's also unclear if these medicines help. GORD is when reflux causes symptoms bad enough to need treatment. More research is needed to know for sure.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a condition where the stomach contents flow back up into the oesophagus, causing symptoms such as regurgitation. It is a common problem in infants, affecting approximately 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, particularly if they have other medical conditions.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. We need to distinguish between GOR and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD is defined as GOR that causes symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Current guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasize that GORD needs to be managed effectively.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nPharmacological treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H₂ antagonists, are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for GOR in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications, and to identify any potential harms associated with these treatments.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. These studies were conducted in various countries, though specific locations were not detailed. Most studies lasted around two weeks, with some extending up to several months. The funding sources were not explicitly stated.\n\nThe studies included infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old, with some focusing on specific age groups like neonates. Interventions included medicines such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors, compared to a placebo or other medications.\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn't enough data to assess other medications. More studies with longer follow-up are needed, especially for groups like preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities.\n\nThe review found that medicines may or may not help infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. There is no clear evidence to support using specific medicines like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or proton pump inhibitors. For older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain. More research is needed to confirm how effective these medicines are.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nFuture research should look at the long-term effects of these medicines. We need to understand their benefits and harms for different groups, like premature babies or children with disabilities. This will help families and doctors make better decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, several clarity issues should be addressed to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace technical terms with simpler, everyday language.** The text uses several medical terms that can be simplified to improve readability.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'Pharmacological treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H₂ antagonists, are often used to manage GOR in children.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Pharmacological treatments' is jargon. 'H₂ antagonists' is an unnecessary detail as it's not discussed elsewhere.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Medicines, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are often used to manage GOR in children.'\n\n2. **Simplify dense, noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences are structured in a way that is difficult to process quickly. Rewriting them with a more direct, active style will help.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'GORD is defined as GOR that causes symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Current guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasize that GORD needs to be managed effectively.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is abstract and uses more nouns than necessary ('management').\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'When reflux causes symptoms bad enough to need treatment, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say it is important to treat GORD.'\n\n3. **Write in a more direct and personal voice.** The draft switches between the third person ('the review authors') and the first person ('we'). Using 'we' consistently makes the summary more engaging and aligns with Cochrane style.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'The review authors aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for GOR in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is wordy and impersonal. The style guide recommends using 'we'.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We wanted to find out how well different medicines work for treating GOR in children, including their benefits and harms.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns compared to a typical Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will significantly improve clarity for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns in many areas, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, long words, and noun count, are in the P90 range, indicating the text is denser and uses more difficult words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests a need to simplify vocabulary and sentence construction."
