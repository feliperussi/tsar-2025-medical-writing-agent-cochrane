  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux (a condition where stomach acid flows back into the throat) in children?\n\nKey Messages\n- The effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in children are not clearly understood. There is no strong evidence to support the use of specific medications, including omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are medicines that reduce stomach acid production, because of a lack of robust evidence.\n- Medicines may or may not provide a benefit for infants and children with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), a condition where gastro-oesophageal reflux causes symptoms severe enough to merit treatment, and further research is needed to determine their effectiveness.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these medications and their potential benefits and harms in different subgroups of children, such as preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities, to provide more accurate and reliable information for decision-making.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a condition where the stomach contents flow back up into the oesophagus, causing symptoms such as regurgitation. It is a common problem in infants, affecting approximately 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, particularly if they have other medical conditions.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. We need to distinguish between GOR and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD is defined as GOR that causes symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Current guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasize that GORD needs to be managed effectively.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nPharmacological treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H₂ antagonists, are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for GOR in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications, and to identify any potential harms associated with these treatments.\n\nMethods\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. These studies were conducted in various countries, though specific locations were not detailed. Most studies lasted around two weeks, with some extending up to several months. The funding sources were not explicitly stated.\n\nThe studies included infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old, with some focusing on specific age groups like neonates. Interventions included medicines such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors, compared to a placebo or other medications.\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn't enough data to assess other medications. More studies with longer follow-up are needed, especially for groups like preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities.\n\nThe review found that medicines may or may not help infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. There is no clear evidence to support using specific medicines like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or proton pump inhibitors. For older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain. More research is needed to confirm how effective these medicines are.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and do not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, and the summary is factually accurate and well-structured. However, the language is too complex for a general audience, which will make it difficult for many readers to understand the key messages. The main issues are overly long sentences and the use of technical vocabulary. Here are the top 4 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Simplify the opening Key Message.** The first key message is 49 words long and repeats the same point three times. This can overwhelm the reader from the start.\n   - **Problem:** \"The effects of medicines in treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in children are not clearly understood. There is no strong evidence to support the use of specific medications, including omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are medicines that reduce stomach acid production, because of a lack of robust evidence.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Try breaking this into two shorter sentences: \"We don't know for sure how well medicines work for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux. There is not enough good evidence to know if specific drugs—like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or other proton pump inhibitors (medicines that reduce stomach acid)—are helpful.\"\n\n2. **Break down long sentences that contain complex definitions.** Some sentences try to do too much at once, defining a term and presenting a finding in the same breath.\n   - **Problem:** \"Medicines may or may not provide a benefit for infants and children with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), a condition where gastro-oesophageal reflux causes symptoms severe enough to merit treatment, and further research is needed to determine their effectiveness.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Separate the definition from the result to make it easier to digest: \"For children with more severe reflux (called GORD), it's also unclear if these medicines help. GORD is when reflux causes symptoms bad enough to need treatment. More research is needed to know for sure.\"\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language instead of abstract nouns.** Sentences heavy with nouns can feel dense and impersonal. Using verbs makes the text more engaging.\n   - **Problem:** \"Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these medications and their potential benefits and harms in different subgroups of children...to provide more accurate and reliable information for decision-making.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase using more verbs: \"Future research should look at the long-term effects of these medicines. We need to understand their benefits and harms for different groups, like premature babies or children with disabilities. This will help families and doctors make better decisions.\"\n\n4. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader. Two subheadings are currently single words.\n   - **Problem:** \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\".\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change these to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\nAddressing these points will significantly improve the clarity and readability of the summary for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in some areas, such as sentence structure and use of active voice. However, it flags significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for complex words (Dale-Chall), long words, and the SMOG index are all in the 'BEYOND_P90' or 'P90' range, indicating the vocabulary is much more difficult than in a typical Plain Language Summary. This data supports the editorial feedback to simplify word choices and shorten complex sentences to improve readability for a lay audience."
