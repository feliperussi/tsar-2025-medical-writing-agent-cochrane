  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines for gastro-oesophageal reflux (when stomach contents flow back into the food pipe) in children?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are very uncertain about how well medicines, like those that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors), work for children with reflux. The evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure.\n- For infants and children with GORD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, a condition where reflux causes symptoms severe enough to merit treatment), it is uncertain if medicines provide any benefit. More research is needed to know for sure.\n- More research is needed on the long-term effects of these medicines, especially for groups like premature babies or children with disabilities.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) happens when what's in the stomach comes back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). This can cause symptoms like spitting up (regurgitation). It's a common problem in infants, affecting about 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience symptoms that last longer, especially if they have other health problems.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. Health experts recommend treating reflux when symptoms are severe. This is known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or GORD.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nMedicines, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are often used to manage GOR in children. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary, and there is a need to assess their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work for treating GOR in children, including their benefits and harms. We looked at which treatments are most effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of complications.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that tested medicines for reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies tested medicines like omeprazole, esomeprazole, and ranitidine against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medicines. For infants, we found that medicines may or may not help with reflux symptoms. There was no clear evidence that specific drugs like omeprazole, esomeprazole, or other proton pump inhibitors are effective. In older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because most of the studies were small. They also didn't look at all the different types of children, treatments, or results that are important to families.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWhat research is needed next?\nFuture research should look at the long-term effects of these medicines. We need to understand their benefits and harms for different groups, like premature babies or children with disabilities. This will help families and doctors make better decisions.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show this is a very strong and highly readable draft. It conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling in the best quartile. All readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 9.6). The only minor deviation is a slightly high noun count (P90), which can sometimes make sentences less direct but does not significantly impact the draft's high overall quality. The feedback provided focuses on small refinements to make an already excellent draft even better."
