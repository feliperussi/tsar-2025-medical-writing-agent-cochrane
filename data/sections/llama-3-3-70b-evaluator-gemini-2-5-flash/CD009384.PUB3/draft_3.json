  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it's essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency (a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, which is important for growth and development).\n- Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections (infections in the lungs) or malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes), in this age group. More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its potential interactions with other nutrients (substances that provide nourishment), and the specific populations that may benefit most from this intervention, to provide more comprehensive guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem?\nZinc deficiency is when a child's body doesn't have enough zinc, an important nutrient. This is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. Zinc plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including immune function (how the body fights off infections), wound healing, and protein synthesis (how the body builds and repairs tissues).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality (death), morbidity (illness), and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years. They wanted to determine whether zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of death, illness, and growth problems in children, and if it can promote healthy growth and development. The authors also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria.\n\nMethods\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. Our search was up to February 2022, and we focused on randomized controlled trials.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, zinc dose, duration, and outcomes related to mortality, morbidity (e.g., diarrhea, pneumonia), and growth (height-for-age, weight-for-age). If the two reviewers disagreed, they discussed the study until they reached an agreement. We then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\n\nHow did we rate the certainty of the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. This involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. Most children in the studies received the zinc as a syrup, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children?\nZinc supplementation probably reduces the incidence of diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not fully confident in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. Also, the children in the studies and the way they received zinc were very different from each other, which makes the results hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it needs revision to reduce its overly formal and academic tone, which makes it difficult for a lay audience to read. The main issues are the frequent use of complex, noun-heavy phrases instead of simple, active verbs. Addressing the 3 improvements below will significantly improve clarity and readability for patients and their families.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Active Verbs**\n\nYour sentences often use abstract nouns where simpler verbs would be clearer. This makes the text dense and less direct.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its potential interactions with other nutrients... and the specific populations that may benefit most from this intervention, to provide more comprehensive guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is packed with abstract nouns like 'investigation', 'effects', 'interactions', 'intervention', and 'guidance'. This academic style is hard for a non-specialist to ...\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"In the future, researchers should study the long-term effects of taking zinc. They also need to learn how zinc interacts with other nutrients and which children might benefit most. This will help provide clearer advice for parents and healthcare providers.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Formal and Academic Language**\n\nSome phrases are taken directly from the style of a technical abstract and should be simplified for a plain language summary.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality (death), morbidity (illness), and growth failure...\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"aimed to assess the effects of\" is unnecessarily formal. While you define the technical terms, the overall sentence structure is still complex.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements could prevent deaths, illness, and growth problems.\"\n\n**3. Use a Consistent, Personal Tone with 'We'**\n\nThe style guide recommends using 'we' to refer to the review authors, but the draft is inconsistent. This creates a disconnected tone.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess ...\" and \"Two reviewers independently extracted data...\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The text switches between the impersonal \"The review authors\" and the personal \"we\" used in the Methods section. Sticking to \"we\" throughout makes the summary more direct and engaging.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We aimed to assess...\" and \"Two of us independently extracted data...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\n\nThese editorial suggestions are strongly supported by the linguistic analysis. The draft has an unusually high number of nouns (229), nominalizations (31), and complex words (302) compared to typical plain language summaries, with all four metrics falling in the 'BEYOND_P90' range. This confirms the text is denser and more complex than it needs to be.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While sentence-level metrics like sentence length (18.17 words, P25) and active voice use (70%, P75) are strong, the summary deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for nominalization (31, BEYOND_P90), total nouns (229, BEYOND_P90), Dale-Chall complex words (302, BEYOND_P90), and long words (216, BEYOND_P90) are all unusually high, indicating the text is dense and uses overly formal language that should be simplified."
