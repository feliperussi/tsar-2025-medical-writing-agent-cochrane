  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it's essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency (a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, which is important for growth and development).\n- Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections (infections in the lungs) or malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes), in this age group. More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its potential interactions with other nutrients (substances that provide nourishment), and the specific populations that may benefit most from this intervention, to provide more comprehensive guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem?\nZinc deficiency is when a child's body doesn't have enough zinc, an important nutrient. This is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. Zinc plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including immune function (how the body fights off infections), wound healing, and protein synthesis (how the body builds and repairs tissues).\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality (death), morbidity (illness), and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years. They wanted to determine whether zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of death, illness, and growth problems in children, and if it can promote healthy growth and development. The authors also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we search for studies?\nWe looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. Our search was up to February 2022, and we focused on randomized controlled trials.\n\n### How did we collect and combine the data?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, zinc dose, duration, and outcomes related to mortality, morbidity (e.g., diarrhea, pneumonia), and growth (height-for-age, weight-for-age). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, where appropriate, pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n### How did we rate the certainty of the evidence?\nThe certainty of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Confidence levels were reported as high, moderate, low, or very low, guiding the interpretation of zinc's impact on child health.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\n\n### What were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children?\nZinc supplementation probably reduces the incidence of diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, and incomplete coverage of the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to meet our plain language standards. There is one critical issue with the subheadings, and several sections use technical language that would be difficult for a lay audience to understand. Here are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n\n*   **Subheadings Must Be Questions:** Two subheadings do not follow the required question format.\n    *   **Text:** \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\"\n    *   **Problem:** Our style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change these to questions. For example: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Technical Language in the Methods Section:** This section contains jargon that is not suitable for a plain language summary.\n    *   **Text:** \"Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, where appropriate, pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\" and \"The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\"\n    *   **Problem:** Terms like 'random-effects meta-analysis', 'risk of bias', and 'publication bias' are unfamiliar to most readers.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this to explain the process in simple terms. For example: \"If the two reviewers disagreed, they discussed the study until they reached an agreement. We then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\" and \"We rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. This involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\"\n\n2.  **Replace Complex and Noun-Heavy Phrasing:** The summary has many long, complex words and uses noun forms instead of direct verbs, making it dense and hard to read.\n    *   **Text:** \"The evidence is limited by small study sizes, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, and incomplete coverage of the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is a wall of technical terms. Words like 'heterogeneity', 'participant characteristics', and 'comparators' are difficult to understand.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please break this down into simpler ideas. For example: \"We are not fully confident in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. Also, the children in the studies and the way they received zinc were very different from each other, which makes the results hard to compare.\"\n\n3.  **Use Active Voice Instead of Passive Voice:** The draft often uses passive voice, which can make the text feel impersonal and unclear.\n    *   **Text:** \"The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup...\"\n    *   **Problem:** It's not clear who delivered the intervention. The style guide requires using the active voice (\"we found,\" \"we gave\").\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change passive sentences to active ones. For example: \"Most children in the studies received the zinc as a syrup...\" or \"We usually gave the zinc as a syrup...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some readability scores are good (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is in the best quartile), there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Six different metrics fall into the 'BEYOND_P90' category, including those for complex words (smog_index, complex_words), long words, and noun-heavy sentences (nominalization, nouns). The high number of passive voice constructions (P90) also deviates from typical patterns. These results support the editorial feedback to simplify technical jargon, reduce complex vocabulary, and use more direct, active verbs."
