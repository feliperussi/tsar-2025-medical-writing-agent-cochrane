  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years? \nWe found that giving children zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. \nIt’s essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency - a condition where the body doesn’t have enough zinc, which is important for growth and development. \nZinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections or malaria, in this age group. \nMore research is needed to understand the long-term effects of zinc supplements and to find out which groups of children might benefit the most.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem? \nZinc deficiency is when a child’s body doesn’t have enough zinc, an important nutrient. \nThis is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. \nZinc is crucial for the body to work properly - it helps the immune system fight infections, heal wounds, and build and repair tissues.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements could prevent deaths, illness, and growth problems. \nWe also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria.\n\nHow did we search for studies? \nWe looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. \nOur search was up to February 2022, and we focused on studies called “randomized controlled trials”, as these provide the most reliable evidence.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data? \nTwo of us reviewed each study and collected information on how it was done, who the children were, the dose of zinc they took, and for how long. \nWe looked at the effects on death, illness, and growth. \nWe then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\n\nHow did we rate the certainty of the evidence? \nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. \nThis involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. \nThe studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. \nMost of the children included in this review were under five years of age. \nThe intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. \nThe median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children? \nGiving children zinc supplements probably reduces how often children get diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. \nHowever, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. \nFor every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. \nThe benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. \nMany of the studies were small. \nAlso, the children in the studies and the way they received zinc were very different from each other, which makes the results hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThis review updates our previous review. \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on simplifying some of the more technical and noun-heavy sentences. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace technical terms with simpler, everyday language.** Some sentences in the results section read like they are for a scientific audience. Using simpler terms will make the findings easier to understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\"\n   - **Reason:** Words like 'intervention', 'delivered', 'median duration', and 'follow-up' are technical jargon. \n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Most children in the studies took zinc as a syrup (zinc sulfate). The usual dose was 10 mg to 15 mg per day. Researchers tracked the children's health for about 6 months (26 weeks).\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** The draft sometimes uses complex noun phrases where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences longer and harder to process.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It’s essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency - a condition where the body doesn’t have enough zinc, which is important for growth and development.\"\n   - **Reason:** This sentence is long and abstract. Phrases like \"potential benefits and harms\" and \"a condition where\" can be simplified.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It's important to weigh the good and bad effects, especially where children are at high risk of zinc deficiency. This means their bodies don't have enough zinc to grow well.\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations more specific and concrete.** The explanation of the limitations is a bit vague. Providing specific examples of the differences between studies helps the reader better understand why the evidence is limited.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Also, the children in the studies and the way they received zinc were very different from each other, which makes the results hard to compare.\"\n   - **Reason:** This is correct but doesn't explain *how* they were different.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, the studies included children of different ages and health backgrounds, and they used different doses of zinc. This variety makes it hard to combine the results and draw firm conclusions.\"\n\nAddressing these points will help resolve the high number of nominalizations, long words, and complex words identified in the linguistic analysis, making the summary more direct and accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is generally readable, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for typical PLS patterns. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Metrics for nominalization (noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more dense and uses more complex vocabulary than a typical PLS."
