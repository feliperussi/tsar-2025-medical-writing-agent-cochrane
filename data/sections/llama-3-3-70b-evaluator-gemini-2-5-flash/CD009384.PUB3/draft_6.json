  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n- It's essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency.\n- Zinc deficiency means the body doesn't have enough zinc, which is an important nutrient for growth.\n- We also found that zinc supplementation had little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections or malaria, in this age group.\n- More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem?\nZinc deficiency is when a child's body doesn't have enough zinc, an important nutrient. This is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. Zinc is crucial for the body to work properly. It helps the immune system fight infections, heal wounds, and build and repair tissues.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements could prevent deaths, illness, and growth problems. We also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria.\n\nMethods\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. Our search was up to February 2022, and we focused on randomized controlled trials.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data?\nTwo of us reviewed each study and collected information on how it was done, who the children were, the dose of zinc they took, and for how long. We looked at the effects on death, illness (like diarrhea and pneumonia), and growth. We then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\n\nHow did we rate the certainty of the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. This involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children?\nZinc supplementation probably reduces how often children get diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. Also, the children in the studies and the way they received zinc were very different from each other, which makes the results hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

All subheadings are correctly formatted as questions.\n\nTop 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n1. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** The text often uses abstract nouns where simpler verbs would be clearer and more direct for the reader. This will make the sentences less dense and easier to understand.\n\n   - **Example:** \"The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is abstract and packed with nouns ('benefits', 'supplementation', 'harms', 'risk', 'deficiency'), which can be hard to process.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Giving children zinc supplements may be more helpful than harmful in places where many children do not get enough zinc.\"\n\n2. **Make the final key message more specific and informative.** The last key message is a generic statement that misses an opportunity to provide valuable context from the source material about what kind of research is needed.\n\n   - **Example:** \"More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is too vague. The original source material specifies what future research should investigate.\n   - **Suggestion:** Based on the source text, a more helpful message would be: \"More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of zinc supplements and to find out which groups of children might benefit the most.\"\n\n3. **Explain or simplify technical terms.** The summary includes a term that is common in research but may be unfamiliar to a lay audience.\n\n   - **Example:** \"...and we focused on randomized controlled trials.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Randomized controlled trials\" is medical jargon. While accurate, it doesn't help the reader understand *why* these studies were chosen.\n   - **Suggestion:** Briefly explain the term's importance. For example: \"We focused on studies called 'randomized controlled trials', as these provide the most reliable evidence.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nYour draft is very well-written and scores highly on most readability metrics. The feedback above focuses on addressing the few areas flagged by the linguistic analysis, specifically the high counts for **nominalization** (using nouns instead of verbs) and **complex vocabulary**, which can make the text feel more formal and less direct for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The word count is well within the limit. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate from typical patterns: 'nominalization' (P90), 'nouns' (P90), and 'complex_words_dc' (P90). This suggests the text is slightly too reliant on abstract nouns and complex vocabulary, which could be simplified to further improve clarity for a lay audience."
