  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it's essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency (a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, which is important for growth and development).\n- Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections (infections in the lungs) or malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes), in this age group. More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- In the future, researchers should study the long-term effects of taking zinc. They also need to learn how zinc interacts with other nutrients and which children might benefit most. This will help provide clearer advice for parents and healthcare providers.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem?\nZinc deficiency is when a child's body doesn't have enough zinc, an important nutrient. This is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. Zinc plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including immune function (how the body fights off infections), wound healing, and protein synthesis (how the body builds and repairs tissues).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements could prevent deaths, illness, and growth problems. We also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria.\n\nMethods\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. Our search was up to February 2022, and we focused on randomized controlled trials.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data?\nTwo of us independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, zinc dose, duration, and outcomes related to mortality, morbidity (e.g., diarrhea, pneumonia), and growth (height-for-age, weight-for-age). If we disagreed, we discussed the study until we reached an agreement. We then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\n\nHow did we rate the certainty of the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. This involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. Most children in the studies received the zinc as a syrup, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children?\nZinc supplementation probably reduces the incidence of diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not fully confident in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. Also, the children in the studies and the way they received zinc were very different from each other, which makes the results hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make the language even more direct and accessible for a lay audience, moving from a more academic style to a true plain language voice.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Active Verbs**\nSome sentences rely on complex nouns where simpler verbs would be clearer and more direct for the reader.\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"Zinc plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including immune function (how the body fights off infections), wound healing, and protein synthesis (how the body builds and repairs tissues).\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is packed with abstract nouns ('role', 'functions', 'function', 'healing', 'synthesis'), which can feel dense and academic.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Zinc is crucial for the body to work properly. It helps the immune system fight infections, heal wounds, and build and repair tissues.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Technical Descriptions in the Methods Section**\nThe methods section should describe what you did in everyday language, avoiding research jargon.\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"Two of us independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, zinc dose, duration, and outcomes related to mortality, morbidity (e.g., diarrhea, pneumonia), and growth (height-for-age, weight-for-age).\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** This is a long list of technical terms ('extracted data', 'participant characteristics', 'mortality', 'morbidity') that can be intimidating and unclear to a non-medical reader.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Two of us reviewed each study and collected information on how it was done, who the children were, the dose of zinc they took, and for how long. We looked at the effects on death, illness (like diarrhea and pneumonia), and growth.\"\n\n**3. Make the Limitations Statement More Direct**\nPhrasing in the limitations section can be made more direct to clearly communicate your confidence in the results.\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"We are not fully confident in the evidence for a few reasons.\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"not fully confident\" is slightly indirect. A more straightforward statement can build more trust with the reader.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons.\" or \"There are a few reasons we are not certain about the results.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows that while the draft has good readability scores, it contains a very high number of nouns, nominalizations, and complex words compared to typical plain language summaries. Addressing these points will make the text more engaging and easier for your audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows that the draft is highly conformant with typical PLS patterns in terms of sentence length and general readability, with 67% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The draft has a very high number of nouns (BEYOND_P90), nominalizations (P90), and complex/long words (P90). This indicates that while the sentence structure is simple, the word choice is more academic and less direct than is typical for a PLS, supporting the need to simplify technical terms and replace noun-heavy phrases with verbs."
