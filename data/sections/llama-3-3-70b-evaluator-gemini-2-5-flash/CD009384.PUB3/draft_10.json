  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years? We found that giving children zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. It’s essential to weigh the good and bad effects, especially where children are at high risk of zinc deficiency. This means their bodies don’t have enough zinc to grow well.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem? Zinc deficiency is when a child’s body doesn’t have enough zinc, an important nutrient. This is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. Zinc is crucial for the body to work properly - it helps the immune system fight infections, heal wounds, and build and repair tissues.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements could prevent deaths, illness, and growth problems. We also looked at how zinc supplements could help or harm children, for example, if they changed their risk of getting diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections (infections in the lungs), or malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes).\n\nHow did we search for studies? We looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. Our search was up to February 2022, and we focused on studies called “randomized controlled trials”, as these provide the most reliable evidence.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data? Two of us reviewed each study and collected information on how it was done, who the children were, the dose of zinc they took, and for how long. We looked at the effects on death, illness, and growth. We then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\n\nHow did we rate the certainty of the evidence? We rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. This involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\n\nWhat did we find? We found 96 studies that involved 219,584 children. Most children in the studies took zinc as a syrup (zinc sulfate). The usual dose was 10 mg to 15 mg per day. Researchers tracked the children’s health for about 6 months (26 weeks).\n\nWhat were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children? Giving children zinc supplements probably reduces how often children get diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection (an infection in the lungs), or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. The good effects of zinc supplements may be more important than the bad effects in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies included children of different ages and health backgrounds, and they used different doses of zinc. This variety makes it hard to combine the results and draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages: \n- Taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, but it’s essential to weigh the good and bad effects, especially where children are at high risk of zinc deficiency.\n- Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections or malaria, in this age group, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- Future studies should look at the long-term effects of taking zinc. They should also study how zinc works with other nutrients and find out which groups of children it helps most. This will give better advice to parents and doctors.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. However, it is 'NOT APPROVED' because of a key factual inaccuracy in the main findings that needs correction before publication. Here are the 3 most important improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Clarify the findings on mortality to be more accurate.**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection (an infection in the lungs), or malaria.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This isn't quite right. The original abstract states that zinc *probably reduces* mortality from lung infections and malaria, but the evidence is uncertain. Stating it makes 'little to no difference' is an oversimplification that loses this important nuance.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'For deaths from any cause or from diarrhea, zinc supplements seemed to make little to no difference. For deaths from lung infections or malaria, zinc might help reduce deaths, but the evidence was not strong enough for us to be certain.'\n\n2. **Remove technical jargon from the methods section.**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'We looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The names of specific databases are jargon to a lay reader and don't add to their understanding. The goal is to convey that the search was thorough, not to list the tools used.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched major medical research databases and trial registers to find all relevant studies.'\n\n3. **Use more active verbs instead of nouns in the key messages.**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** 'Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is passive ('was found') and noun-heavy, which can make it less direct and engaging for the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found that giving children zinc supplements did not reduce their risk of getting sick or dying from other causes...'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your draft is very readable, but the linguistic analysis shows a very high number of nouns compared to typical summaries. Making the change suggested in point #3 will help address this by replacing nouns with stronger, more direct verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis also flags three vocabulary metrics that deviate from the norm: the number of nouns is significantly higher than usual (Beyond P90), and the text uses more long words (P90) and Dale-Chall complex words (P90) than is typical. These metrics support the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs."
