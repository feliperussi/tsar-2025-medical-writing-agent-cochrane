  "key_messages": [
    "Taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, but it's essential to consider the potential benefits and harms, especially in regions with a high risk of zinc deficiency (a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, which is important for growth and development).",
    "Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections (infections in the lungs) or malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes), in this age group, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its potential interactions with other nutrients (substances that provide nourishment), and the specific populations that may benefit most from this intervention, to provide more comprehensive guidance for parents and healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is zinc deficiency and why is a problem?",
      "content": "Zinc deficiency is a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, an essential nutrient. It is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and can lead to morbidity, mortality, and linear growth failure in children. Zinc plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis. Without enough zinc, children may experience stunted growth, weakened immune systems, and ... (truncated for brevity)."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years. They wanted to determine whether zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of death, illness, and growth problems in children, and if it can promote healthy growth and development. The authors also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria."

    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and regional databases for randomized controlled trials and observational studies evaluating zinc supplementation in children. Search terms combined synonyms for \"zinc\", \"supplementation\", \"children\", \"mortality\", \"morbidity\", and \"growth\" without language restrictions. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened against predefined inclusion criteria."

      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, zinc dose, duration, and outcomes related to mortality, morbidity (e.g., diarrhoea, pneumonia), and growth (height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑age). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, where appropriate, pooled using random‑effects meta‑analysis."

      "subheading": "Evidence Grading",
      "content": "The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Confidence levels were reported as high, moderate, low, or very low, guiding the interpretation of zinc's impact on child health."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Zinc supplementation for children",
      "content": "Zinc supplementation probably reduces the incidence of diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by small study sizes, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, and incomplete coverage of the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.",
