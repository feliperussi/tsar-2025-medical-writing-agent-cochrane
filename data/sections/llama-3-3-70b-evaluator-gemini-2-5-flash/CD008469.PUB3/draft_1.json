  "draft": "# Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Home-based education for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath) may have little to no difference in reducing exacerbations (sudden worsening of symptoms) leading to emergency department visits or hospitalizations compared to usual care, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- The quality of life for children with asthma may be improved with home-based education, but again, the evidence is uncertain and further studies are required to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of this approach.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children.\n**Introduction**\n### What is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections. Asthma education is an essential component of managing the condition, and includes providing information on the disease process and self-management skills development, such as trigger avoidance.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating home‑based educational interventions for children with asthma. Keywords and MeSH terms related to \"asthma\", \"children\", \"home‑based\", and \"education\" were combined using Boolean operators. No date or language restrictions were applied.\n### Study Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, comparator, follow‑up duration, and asthma‑related outcomes (e.g., symptom scores, medication use, exacerbations) were extracted into a standardized form.\n### Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment\nRisk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Each study was rated as low, some concerns, or high risk of bias across domains such as randomization, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting.\n### Confidence in the Evidence\nThe overall confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome was evaluated with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings and lasted for different durations, but the exact duration is not specified. The population characteristics varied, with participants differing in age, ranging from 1 to 18 years old, and asthma severity, ranging from mild to severe. The studies were conducted in different countries, but the exact countries are not specified. The interventions included home-based educational interventions for children with asthma, and the comparisons included usual care, waiting list, or less-intensive education programs delivered outside the home. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalisation compared to control. A more-intensive home-based education intervention may reduce hospitalisation due to an asthma exacerbation compared with a less-intensive home-based asthma education intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery, very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT_APPROVED due to several critical issues and significant deviations from typical Plain Language Summary patterns.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Many subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory requirement of the style guide. For example, 'Search Strategy' should be 'How did we search for studies?'. 'Limitations' should be 'What are the limitations of this review?'.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Address Subheading Format:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Search Strategy', 'Study Selection and Data Extraction', 'Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment', 'Confidence in the Evidence', 'Limitations', 'Currency'\n    *   **Why problematic:** The Master Style Guide explicitly states that subheadings should be phrased as questions to guide the reader.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        *   'Search Strategy' -> 'How did we search for studies?'\n        *   'Study Selection and Data Extraction' -> 'How did we choose and collect information from studies?'\n        *   'Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment' -> 'How did we assess the quality and risk of bias in the studies?'\n        *   'Confidence in the Evidence' -> 'How confident are we in the evidence?'\n        *   'Limitations' -> 'What are the limitations of this review?'\n        *   'Currency' -> 'How up to date is this review?'\n\n2.  **Reduce Passive Voice and Increase Active Voice:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Keywords and MeSH terms related to \"asthma\", \"children\", \"home‑based\", and \"education\" were combined using Boolean operators.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence uses passive voice, obscuring who performed the action. The Master Style Guide recommends using active voice. The PLS evaluation shows 42 instances of passive voice (BEYOND_P90), indicating a significant deviation from typical PLS patterns.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We combined keywords and MeSH terms related to 'asthma', 'children', 'home-based', and 'education' using Boolean operators.'\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** This is another instance of passive voice, making the sentence less direct.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We resolved discrepancies by consensus or with a third reviewer.'\n\n3.  **Simplify Vocabulary, Reduce Nominalization, and Shorten Sentences:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Asthma education is an essential component of managing the condition, and includes providing information on the disease process and self-management skills development, such as trigger avoidance.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is noun-heavy and uses nominalizations ('management', 'providing information', 'skills development', 'avoidance'), making it less direct and harder to read. It is also quite long. The PLS evaluation highlights high nominalization (55, BEYOND_P90) and noun count (266, BEYOND_P90), along with high complex and long words, contributing to poor readability scores.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.'\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Home-based education for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath) may have little to no difference in reducing exacerbations (sudden worsening of symptoms) leading to emergency department visits or hospitalizations compared to usual care, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.'\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is excessively long (49 words) and dense, combining too many complex ideas. The parenthetical definition of asthma is also redundant as it's already in the title. The high 'words_per_sentence' (24.27, P75) and low 'flesch_reading_ease' (31.59, P10) confirm the difficulty this sentence poses.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Home-based education for children with asthma may not significantly reduce sudden worsening of symptoms (exacerbations) that lead to emergency department visits or hospitalizations, compared to usual care. However, the evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns across multiple metrics. Readability indices such as Flesch Reading Ease (31.59, P10), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (14.88, P90), and SMOG Index (17.04, BEYOND_P90) show the text is considerably more difficult to read than typical PLS. This is supported by high values for `words_per_sentence` (24.27, P75), `complex_words` (205, BEYOND_P90), `long_words` (293, BEYOND_P90), and `complex_words_dc` (362, BEYOND_P90). Furthermore, the draft exhibits a very high use of `passive_voice` (42, BEYOND_P90), `nominalization` (55, BEYOND_P90), and `nouns` (266, BEYOND_P90), all of which are significantly above typical ranges, contributing to the text's complexity and less direct style. These deviations confirm the need for substantial revisions to improve clarity, conciseness, and overall readability for a lay audience."
