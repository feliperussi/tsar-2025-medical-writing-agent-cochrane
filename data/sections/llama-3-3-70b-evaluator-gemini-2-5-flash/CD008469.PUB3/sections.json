  "key_messages": [
    "Home-based education for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath) may have little to no difference in reducing exacerbations (sudden worsening of symptoms) leading to emergency department visits or hospitalizations compared to usual care, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.",
    "The quality of life for children with asthma may be improved with home-based education, but again, the evidence is uncertain and further studies are required to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of this approach.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children."

      "subheading": "What is asthma and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Asthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections. Asthma education is an essential component of managing the condition, and includes providing information on the disease process and self-management skills development, such as trigger avoidance."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating home‑based educational interventions for children with asthma. Keywords and MeSH terms related to \"asthma\", \"children\", \"home‑based\", and \"education\" were combined using Boolean operators. No date or language restrictions were applied."

      "subheading": "Study Selection and Data Extraction",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, comparator, follow‑up duration, and asthma‑related outcomes (e.g., symptom scores, medication use, exacerbations) were extracted into a standardized form."

      "subheading": "Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment",
      "content": "Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Each study was rated as low, some concerns, or high risk of bias across domains such as randomization, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting."

      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "The overall confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome was evaluated with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings and lasted for different durations, but the exact duration is not specified. The population characteristics varied, with participants differing in age, ranging from 1 to 18 years old, and asthma severity, ranging from mild to severe. The studies were conducted in different countries, but the exact countries are not specified. The interventions included home-based educational interventions for children with asthma, and the comparisons included usual care, waiting list, or less-intensive education programs delivered outside the home. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalisation compared to control. A more-intensive home-based education intervention may reduce hospitalisation due to an asthma exacerbation compared with a less-intensive home-based asthma education intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery, very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
