  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may not significantly reduce sudden worsening of symptoms (exacerbations) that lead to emergency department visits or hospitalizations, compared to usual care. However, the evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections. Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating home-based educational interventions for children with asthma. We combined keywords and MeSH terms related to \"asthma\", \"children\", \"home-based\", and \"education\" using Boolean operators. No date or language restrictions were applied.\n\nHow did we choose and collect information from studies?\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or with a third reviewer. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, comparator, follow-up duration, and asthma-related outcomes into a standardized form.\n\nHow did we assess the quality and risk of bias in the studies?\nWe assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. Each study was rated as low, some concerns, or high risk of bias across domains such as randomization, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nThe overall confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome was evaluated with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings and lasted for different durations. The population characteristics varied, with participants differing in age and asthma severity. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalization compared to control. A more-intensive home-based education intervention may reduce hospitalization due to an asthma exacerbation compared with a less-intensive home-based asthma education intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery, very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is one factual error regarding the certainty of evidence that must be corrected. The primary issue is that the methods section is far too technical for a lay audience and needs to be completely rewritten. Additionally, the draft consistently uses passive voice and complex vocabulary, which makes it difficult to understand. I have outlined the top 3 improvements needed below.\n\n**1. Correct Factual Error in Key Finding**\n\nThe certainty of evidence for a key finding is misstated. This must be corrected to ensure accuracy.\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"A more-intensive home-based education intervention may reduce hospitalization due to an asthma exacerbation compared with a less-intensive home-based asthma education intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The original abstract states this finding is based on \"low-certainty evidence,\" not \"very uncertain\" evidence. This is a significant difference in the level of confidence.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"A more-intensive home-based education program may reduce hospital stays due to an asthma flare-up compared with a less-intensive program (based on low-certainty evidence).\"\n\n**2. Simplify the Overly Technical Methods Section**\n\nThe four subheadings explaining the review's methods are too detailed and use technical jargon not suitable for a plain language summary. This section should be a single, brief, easy-to-understand paragraph.\n- **Problematic Section:** The entire block from \"How did we search for studies?\" to \"How confident are we in the evidence?\" uses terms like \"Boolean operators,\" \"predefined inclusion criteria,\" \"Cochrane Risk of Bias tool,\" and \"GRADE approach.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This language is meant for researchers, not patients and their families. It creates a barrier to understanding how the review was conducted.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Replace all four paragraphs with a single, simple one like this:\n\n\"**How did we conduct this review?**\nReview authors searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. To be included, studies had to be randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\"\n\n**3. Use Active Voice and Simpler Words**\n\nThe draft frequently uses passive voice and unnecessarily complex words, making sentences feel academic and impersonal. This is reflected in the evaluation metrics, which show very high use of passive voice, nominalizations, and complex words.\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery, very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Heterogeneity,\" \"intervention delivery,\" and the passive structure make this sentence dense and hard to follow.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. The studies were also very small, it was not always possible to hide which group people were in, and some results were not fully reported.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 33.3% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there is a significant deviation from a plain language style, with 7 out of 18 metrics (39%) falling in the 'BEYOND_P90' category. These deviations are concentrated in areas of vocabulary complexity (smog_index, complex_words, long_words) and sentence structure (passive_voice, nominalization, nouns), confirming that the draft is too academic and relies heavily on passive constructions and difficult vocabulary."
