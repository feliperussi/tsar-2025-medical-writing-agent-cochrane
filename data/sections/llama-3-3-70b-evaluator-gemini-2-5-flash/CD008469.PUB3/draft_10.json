  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\nWe want to find out if educating children with asthma at home works better than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also want to know which parts of the education program are most helpful.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it hard to breathe. Asthma symptoms can be triggered by 'triggers' like allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions), exercise, and respiratory infections. We teach people how to manage their asthma. This includes helping them understand how the disease works and learn skills to avoid things that trigger their symptoms. Asthma affects 262.4 million people worldwide.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if educating children with asthma at home works better than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also wanted to know which parts of an education program are most helpful.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. We only included 'randomized controlled trials', where researchers put people into treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The people in the studies differed in age and in the severity of their asthma (from mild to severe). Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but we have very low confidence in this finding. We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things, like reducing emergency visits or hospital stays, because the evidence is very uncertain. However, more-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. In some studies, families and researchers knew which treatment group they were in, which could have influenced the results. Also, some studies did not report all of the results they collected.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may make little to no difference to the number of emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care. We have very low confidence in this evidence.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\n- More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n- Future research should focus on finding out which specific parts of an education program are most important and where the education should be delivered.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and meets the word count limit. However, it is not yet approved because a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are some redundant phrasing, use of a technical term without explanation, and a pattern of indirect language that makes some sentences less clear than they could be.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Remove Redundancy in the Introduction**\n\nThe aims of the review are stated twice, once in the first paragraph and again under its own heading. This makes the opening feel repetitive.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:**\n    *   *First paragraph:* \"We want to find out if educating children with asthma at home works better than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also want to know which parts of the education program are most helpful.\"\n    *   *Third paragraph:* \"We wanted to find out if educating children with asthma at home works better than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also wanted to know which parts of an education program are most helpful.\"\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n    *   Rewrite the first paragraph to be a simpler, more general introduction. For example: \"This review looks at whether teaching children with asthma and their families at home is an effective way to manage the condition.\"\n    *   Keep the detailed aims in the third paragraph under the heading \"What did we want to find out?\"\n\n**2. Explain the Term 'Control'**\n\nThe word \"control\" is common in research but is jargon to a public audience. It should be replaced with a clearer term.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\"\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to **usual care**, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\"\n\n**3. Use More Direct, Active Language**\n\nSome sentences are wordy or use noun forms instead of direct verbs. This pattern makes the text less engaging and harder to read, as reflected in the linguistic analysis.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"This includes helping them understand how the disease works and learn skills to avoid things that trigger their symptoms.\"\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This includes **understanding** the disease and **learning how to avoid** symptom triggers.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary clearer and more accessible for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and simplicity. However, it deviates significantly in two areas: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is well beyond the typical range (BEYOND_P90), and the count of passive voice constructions is also high (P90). These two factors contribute to a less direct and occasionally wordy style that can be improved."
