  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\nWe wanted to know if education at home helps children with asthma. We found it may not reduce emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care. However, the evidence is very uncertain. \n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. In people with asthma, the airways in the lungs swell and tighten, which makes it hard to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections. Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. To be included, studies had to be randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The people in the studies were very different. They ranged in age, and their asthma was from mild to severe. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things. We are not sure if home-based education reduces emergency visits. However, more-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. The studies were also very small, and in some studies, the researchers could not hide which group people were in, and the study authors did not report all their results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may not reduce emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and reduce complexity before it can be approved. The text often uses formal, noun-heavy language taken directly from the technical abstract, which makes it difficult for a lay audience to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase formal objectives into simple questions.** The aims section is too technical and uses complex noun phrases instead of simple verbs. This makes it hard for readers to quickly grasp what you were trying to find out.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if asthma education at home works better for children than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also wanted to know which parts of the education program were most helpful.\"\n\n2. **Use active voice to make sentences clearer.** The methods section uses passive voice, which can make it unclear who is performing the action. Using active voice makes the text more direct and easier to follow.\n   \n   - **Problematic text:** \"...where people are put into treatment groups by chance.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...where researchers assign people to treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin.\"\n\n3. **Be precise with the certainty of evidence.** The summary uses \"the evidence is very uncertain\" for multiple findings. However, the original review found a difference between \"low-certainty\" and \"very low-certainty\" evidence. It's important to reflect this nuance accurately.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education. We have low confidence in this finding.\" (This better reflects the original abstract's \"low-certainty evidence\").",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 72.2% of metrics in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and active voice. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence construction, with metrics for nominalization (BEYOND_P90), passive voice (P90), noun count (P90), and complex/long words (P90) falling outside the typical range. These deviations support the editorial feedback, indicating the text relies too heavily on noun-based phrases and complex vocabulary, which can reduce clarity for a lay audience."
