  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\nWe wanted to find out if asthma education at home works better for children than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also wanted to know which parts of the education program were most helpful.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition (a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs) that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. In people with asthma, the airways in the lungs swell and tighten, which makes it hard to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing (a high-pitched sound when breathing out), coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions), exercise, and respiratory infections (infections that affect the lungs and airways). Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers (things that can cause asthma symptoms).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if asthma education at home works better for children than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also wanted to know which parts of the education program were most helpful.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. To be included, studies had to be randomized controlled trials (a type of study where people are put into treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin), where researchers assign people to treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The people in the studies were very different - they ranged in age, and their asthma was from mild to severe. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but we have very low confidence in this finding. We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things, such as reducing emergency visits or hospital stays, because the evidence is very uncertain. However, more-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. The studies were also very small, and in some studies, the researchers could not hide which group people were in, and the study authors did not report all their results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may not reduce emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\n- More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children.",

      "feedback": "The summary is not approved. While it passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness, there are several opportunities to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. Here are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Remove repetitive content.** The main research question is stated verbatim in the introduction and again under the subheading 'What did the review authors want to find out?'. The second instance should be removed or rewritten.\n    *   **Quote:** 'output' 'We wanted to find out if asthma education at home works better for children than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the paragraph under 'What did the review authors want to find out?' as it repeats the opening paragraph.\n\n2. **Simplify complex sentences and definitions.** The paragraph explaining asthma contains four parenthetical definitions, making it dense and difficult to follow.\n    *   **Quote:** 'Asthma is a chronic airway condition (a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs)... triggered by various factors such as allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions)... and respiratory infections (infections that affect the lungs and airways).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter sentences and integrate the definitions more smoothly. For example: 'Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs. ... Asthma symptoms can be started by 'triggers'. Common triggers include allergens, which are substances that cause allergic reactions...'\n\n3. **Clarify the description of study methods.** The explanation of randomized controlled trials is repetitive and confusing.\n    *   **Quote:** '...studies had to be randomized controlled trials (a type of study where people are put into treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin), where researchers assign people to treatment groups by chance.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Simplify this to avoid repetition. For example: 'We only included 'randomized controlled trials'. In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin.'\n\n4. **Use more direct, active language.** The text often uses noun-heavy phrases ('nominalizations') instead of direct verbs, which can make it sound academic. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a very high number of nominalizations (35 instances, well above the typical range).\n    *   **Quote:** 'Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite using active verbs. For example: 'To manage asthma well, people need to learn about the condition. This includes understanding how the disease works...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with excellent readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10.8). However, it deviates significantly in several key stylistic metrics that impact clarity. The number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and passive voice, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words are also in the P90 range. These metrics support the editorial feedback to use more direct, active verbs and simplify sentence structures to improve readability for a lay audience."
