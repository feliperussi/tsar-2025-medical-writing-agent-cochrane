  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\nWe wanted to find out if asthma education at home works better for children than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also wanted to know which parts of the education program were most helpful.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs. It makes it hard to breathe. Asthma symptoms can be started by 'triggers'. Common triggers include allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions), exercise, and respiratory infections. Asthma affects 262.4 million people worldwide. Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes understanding how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. We only included 'randomized controlled trials'. In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The people in the studies differed in age and in the severity of their asthma (from mild to severe). Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but we have very low confidence in this finding. We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things, such as reducing emergency visits or hospital stays, because the evidence is very uncertain. However, more-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. In some studies, families and researchers knew which treatment group they were in, which could have influenced the results. Also, some studies did not report all of the results they collected.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may not reduce emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\n- More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n- Future researchers should study what the best educational programs are and where they should take place. This will help guide healthcare providers and families on the best ways to manage asthma in children.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and meets almost all readability targets. However, it needs one key improvement before approval: making the language more direct by using verbs instead of noun forms.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Use more active verbs instead of noun forms.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'educating people' instead of 'we educate people'), which can make sentences feel indirect and bureaucratic.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes understanding how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is noun-heavy and less engaging. Using direct verbs makes the text more active and easier for readers to follow.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"People with asthma need education to manage their condition. This helps them understand how the disease works and learn skills to manage it themselves, like how to avoid triggers.\"\n\n2.  **Use active voice to clarify who is doing the action.** The description of the methods uses passive voice, which can be confusing.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** It's not clear who is putting the people into groups. Using the active voice makes this clearer.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In these studies, researchers put people into treatment groups by chance, like flipping a coin.\"\n\n3.  **Rephrase key findings for better clarity.** The first key message is phrased in a way that could be confusing for readers.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"Home-based education for children with asthma may not reduce emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"may not reduce\" is a weak and potentially confusing double negative. It's clearer to state the finding directly as \"little to no difference,\" which also aligns better with the abstract.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Home-based education for children with asthma may make little to no difference to the number of emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care. We have very low confidence in this evidence.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, there is one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile. This metric supports the editorial feedback to make the language more direct and active."
