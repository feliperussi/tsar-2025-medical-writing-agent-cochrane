  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\n- We found that home-based education for children with asthma may not significantly reduce sudden worsening of symptoms (exacerbations) that lead to emergency department visits or hospitalizations, compared to usual care. However, the evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. In people with asthma, the airways in the lungs swell and tighten, which makes it hard to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections. Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. To be included, studies had to be randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The people in the studies were very different. They ranged in age, and their asthma was from mild to severe. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things. The evidence didn't clearly show if it reduced:\n- asthma flare-ups that led to an emergency visit or hospital stay;\n- the need for steroid pills;\n- the number of days people had with no symptoms; or\n- days missed from school or work.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. The studies were also very small, it was not always possible to hide which group people were in, and some results were not fully reported.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is a critical factual omission: the summary fails to mention the finding that more-intensive home education may reduce hospitalizations compared to less-intensive programs. This key finding from the abstract must be included for accuracy. Additionally, several improvements are needed for clarity and style:\n\n1. **Correct and Clarify Findings:** The results for emergency visits and hospitalizations are incorrectly combined, and a key positive finding is missing.\n    *   **Problem:** The 'What did we find?' section lists '- asthma flare-ups that led to an emergency visit or hospital stay;'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Separate these outcomes and add the missing finding. For example: 'We are not sure if home education reduced emergency visits. However, more-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education.'\n\n2. **Simplify Key Messages:** The first key message is a single 57-word sentence that is difficult to follow.\n    *   **Problem:** 'Home-based education for children with asthma... may have little to no difference in reducing exacerbations... leading to emergency department visits or hospitalizations compared to usual care, but the evidence is uncertain...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into several shorter, simpler sentences. For example: 'We wanted to know if education at home helps children with asthma. We found it may not reduce emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care. However, the evidence is very uncertain.'\n\n3. **Use More Active Voice:** The draft frequently uses passive voice, which can make the text feel impersonal and hard to follow.\n    *   **Problem:** '...it was not always possible to hide which group people were in, and some results were not fully reported.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite in the active voice to clarify who is acting. For example: 'In some studies, the researchers could not hide which group people were in, and the study authors did not report all their results.'\n\nThese style issues are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of passive voice constructions (21) and nominalizations (25), deviating from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns in terms of readability, with 15 of 18 metrics (83.3%) falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in three areas related to writing style: passive_voice (P90), nominalization (P90), and nouns (P90). These scores indicate an over-reliance on passive constructions and noun-heavy phrases, which supports the need for the recommended edits to improve clarity and directness."
