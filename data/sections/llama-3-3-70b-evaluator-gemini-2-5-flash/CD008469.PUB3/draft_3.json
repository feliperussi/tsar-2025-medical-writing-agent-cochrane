  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may not significantly reduce sudden worsening of symptoms (exacerbations) that lead to emergency department visits or hospitalizations, compared to usual care. However, the evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area, including the optimal content and setting for educational interventions, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families on the most effective ways to manage asthma in children.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections. Educating people about asthma is essential for managing the condition. This includes informing them about how the disease works and helping them develop self-management skills, such as avoiding triggers.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or education delivered in other settings, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. To be included, studies had to be randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings and lasted for different durations. The population characteristics varied, with participants differing in age and asthma severity. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalization compared to control. A more-intensive home-based education program may reduce hospital stays due to an asthma flare-up compared with a less-intensive program (based on low-certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. The studies were also very small, it was not always possible to hide which group people were in, and some results were not fully reported.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary needs significant editing to make it clearer and easier for a lay audience to understand. The main issues are the overuse of passive voice, complex wording, and noun-heavy sentences, which make the text feel clinical and difficult to read. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use active voice and direct verbs.** The summary relies heavily on passive constructions and noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes the writing less direct. The goal is to clearly state who is doing what.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is passive and clinical. Using active verbs makes the process easier to visualize.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In people with asthma, the airways in the lungs swell and tighten, which makes it hard to breathe.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex terms with simpler, everyday language.** Several sentences use technical or academic phrasing that will be unfamiliar to many readers.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The population characteristics varied, with participants differing in age and asthma severity.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"population characteristics\" and \"participants differing\" are research jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The people in the studies were very different. They ranged in age, and their asthma was from mild to severe.\"\n\n3. **Break up long, list-heavy sentences.** The results section contains a sentence with a long list of outcomes that is difficult to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalization compared to control.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence contains five distinct outcomes, making it dense and hard to absorb.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things. The evidence didn't clearly show if it reduced:\n   - asthma flare-ups that led to an emergency visit or hospital stay;\n   - the need for steroid pills;\n   - the number of days people had with no symptoms; or\n   - days missed from school or work.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While some metrics like sentence length and pronoun use are good (in the best quartile), there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. Seven metrics fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, indicating the text is much more complex and passive than a typical PLS. Specifically, the use of passive voice (28 instances) and nominalizations (30 instances) is exceptionally high, alongside a high density of complex, long, and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words."
