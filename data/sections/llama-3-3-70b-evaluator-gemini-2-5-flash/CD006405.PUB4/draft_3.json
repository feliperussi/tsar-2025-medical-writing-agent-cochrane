  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways). However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Nasal high flow therapy may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of starting treatment compared to CPAP. But it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation. Nasal high flow therapy offers a gentler and less invasive approach to supporting preterm infants' breathing.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, a condition that affects the lungs), or other complications. We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but it probably does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence has some limitations. The studies included different groups of babies and used different ways to give the treatment. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets the word count requirements. The readability scores are good, indicating appropriate sentence length. To make the summary even clearer and more accessible for a lay audience, I recommend focusing on the following three improvements.\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Nasal high flow therapy offers a gentler and less invasive approach to supporting preterm infants' breathing.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like \"approach to supporting\" are abstract and less direct than simple verbs. This can make sentences feel dense and academic.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Nasal high flow therapy is a gentler, less invasive way to help preterm infants breathe.\"\n\n2. **Define or simplify essential technical terms.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** A reader is unlikely to know what \"intubation\" means. All necessary technical terms should be defined in simple language.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, these treatments have risks, like injuring the lungs or needing to insert a breathing tube down the throat (intubation).\"\n\n3. **Replace complex words with simpler, everyday alternatives.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence has some limitations. The studies included different groups of babies and used different ways to give the treatment.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** While clear, words like \"limitations\" and \"included\" can be simplified. The goal is to use the most common words possible.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have some concerns about the evidence. The studies involved different groups of babies and used the treatments in different ways.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of noun-heavy phrases ('nominalizations'), complex words, and long words compared to typical plain language summaries. Addressing these points will significantly improve clarity for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, particularly sentence length and use of active voice, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile. However, it shows significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics are in the P90 range: nominalization (23.0), nouns (167.0), Dale-Chall complex words (254.0), and long words (187.0). This indicates the text relies more heavily on complex vocabulary and noun-based phrases than is typical for a PLS, which could impact reader comprehension."
