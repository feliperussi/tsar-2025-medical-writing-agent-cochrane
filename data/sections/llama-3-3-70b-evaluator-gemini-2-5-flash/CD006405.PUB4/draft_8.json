  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to not work well enough within 72 hours, meaning the baby might need to switch to a different type of breathing support. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often have trouble breathing (called respiratory distress) soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or needing to be intubated (having a breathing tube inserted down the throat). Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death or long-term lung problems (known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD). We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Compared to these other methods, nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD). It may increase the risk of not working well enough within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, babies were not assigned to treatments by chance. This means other factors, not just the treatment, could explain the results, which makes the evidence less certain. The studies we found used different devices and settings for the treatments. Also, very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on three areas:\n\n**1. Simplify Clunky Phrasing in the Key Messages:** Some phrases are grammatically correct but awkward for a lay reader. Using more direct language will improve clarity.\n- **Problem:** 'Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to not work well enough within 72 hours...'\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more direct and introduce the concept of 'treatment failure'. For example: 'Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours (meaning the baby needs to switch to a different type of breathing support).'\n\n**2. Reduce Noun-Heavy Sentences and Complex Words:** The draft relies heavily on technical nouns and complex terms, which can make it dense. Replacing these with simpler, verb-focused sentences will make it easier to read. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nouns, long words, and words outside the common Dale-Chall list.\n- **Problem:** 'Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or needing to be intubated...'\n- **Suggestion:** Try a simpler, more active construction: 'Preterm infants with breathing problems are often treated with CPAP or mechanical ventilation. But these treatments have risks, like injuring the baby's lungs or needing a breathing tube put down their throat (intubation).'\n\n**3. Make the Limitations Section More Concrete:** The explanation of study limitations is a bit abstract. A more concrete example can help readers better understand the scientific concept.\n- **Problem:** 'In some studies, babies were not assigned to treatments by chance. This means other factors, not just the treatment, could explain the results...'\n- **Suggestion:** Clarify *why* this is a problem: 'Our confidence is limited because in some studies, the treatment a baby received was not chosen randomly. This could mean that differences between the groups of babies, rather than the treatments themselves, caused the results we saw.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable with short sentences, placing 83% of its features in the best quartile for PLS conformity. However, it deviates from typical patterns in vocabulary, with a high number of nouns (169.0), Dale-Chall complex words (257.0), and long words (178.0). This suggests that while structurally simple, the text could be made clearer by using more common, everyday language and fewer noun-based phrases."
