  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways). However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation (inserting a breathing tube down the throat). Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, a condition that affects the lungs), or other complications. We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies we found used different devices and settings for the treatments. Also, very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even more accessible for patients and their families, I have three main suggestions focusing on simplifying technical language and making sentences more direct.\n\n**1. Explain key medical JSON fields more simply.**\nSome central concepts could be clearer for readers unfamiliar with them.\n- **Problem:** The term 'respiratory distress' is used several times but never defined in simple terms. The definition for 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia' is also very brief.\n- **Example:** \"Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth...\"\n- **Suggestion:** Add a simple, parenthetical definition the first time you use a term. For example: \"Preterm infants often have trouble breathing (called respiratory distress) soon after birth...\" and \"...bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, a long-term lung condition that can affect premature babies)...\"\n\n**2. Use more direct, active verbs instead of nouns.**\nThe text sometimes uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences feel dense and less direct. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n- **Problem:** Phrases like 'the need for intubation' are less direct than using a verb.\n- **Example:** \"...or the need for intubation (inserting a breathing tube down the throat).\"\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase using the verb. For example: \"...or needing to be intubated (having a breathing tube inserted down the throat).\"\n\n**3. Use consistent terminology for key concepts.**\nThe summary uses several different phrases to describe the main intervention, which could be confusing.\n- **Problem:** The text refers to 'non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe', 'non-invasive breathing support methods', and 'non-invasive respiratory support'. A reader might wonder if these are different things.\n- **Suggestion:** Choose one simple, consistent term, such as 'non-invasive breathing support', and use it throughout the summary.\n\nThese changes will help ensure the summary is as easy as possible for your target audience to understand. The linguistic analysis supports these suggestions, noting that the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns compared to typical plain language summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has excellent overall readability scores, with most metrics falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it also highlights four areas of deviation from typical patterns: high counts of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long the long words. These metrics suggest that while sentences are short, the vocabulary and sentence structure could be simplified further to improve clarity for a lay audience."
