  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often have trouble breathing (called respiratory distress) soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or needing to be intubated (having a breathing tube inserted down the throat). Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death or long-term lung problems (known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD). We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies we found used different devices and settings for the treatments. Also, very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means that differences between the groups of babies, rather than the treatments themselves, could have affected the results. This makes us less confident in the findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, to make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on three key areas: simplifying repetitive technical phrases, clarifying the meaning of 'treatment failure', and making the 'Limitations' section easier to digest. Addressing these points will improve readability and help the summary better connect with a lay audience.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify Repetitive and Long Phrases:** The draft sometimes uses long, technical phrases multiple times, which can make it harder to read.\n   - **Quote:** \"Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The phrase \"other forms of non-invasive respiratory support\" is long and repeated from the previous sentence. This makes the text feel dense.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to these other methods, nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD).\"\n\n**2. Clarify the Meaning of 'Treatment Failure':** The term 'fail' can be alarming and unclear to readers without a medical background.\n   - **Quote:** \"Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** Readers may not understand what 'failure' means in this context. It's important to explain the practical consequence for the infant.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to not work well enough within 72 hours, meaning the baby might need to switch to a different type of breathing support.\"\n\n**3. Make the 'Limitations' Section Easier to Read:** This section contains important concepts, but the wording is a bit dense and noun-heavy.\n   - **Quote:** \"Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means that differences between the groups of babies, rather than the treatments themselves, could have affected the results.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This explanation is correct but could be more direct and use simpler language to convey the core idea of study bias.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In some studies, babies were not assigned to treatments by chance. This means other factors, not just the treatment, could explain the results, which makes the evidence less certain.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of nouns, long words, and complex words compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Simplifying these specific sentences will help improve those metrics and, more importantly, the reader's experience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates from the norm with a high count of nouns (169), Dale-Chall complex words (260), and long words (182). This suggests that while the sentence structure is good, the vocabulary could be simplified by replacing technical terms and noun-heavy phrases with more common, everyday language to enhance clarity for a lay audience."
