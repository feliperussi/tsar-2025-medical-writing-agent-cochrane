  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours, meaning the baby might need to switch to a different type of breathing support. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a way to help premature babies breathe without using a breathing tube. It gently provides warm, moist air and oxygen through two small prongs in the baby's nose. Preterm infants often have trouble breathing soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. We treat preterm infants with breathing problems using CPAP or mechanical ventilation. But these treatments have risks, like injuring the baby's lungs or needing a breathing tube put down their throat. Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to see if nasal high flow therapy reduces the risk of death or long-term lung problems (called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD). We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Compared to these other methods, nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD). It may increase the risk of not working well enough within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Some studies had weaknesses in their methods, which means we can't be certain the results were caused by the treatments alone. The studies also used different devices and settings, making them hard to compare. Very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. However, a few key improvements are needed to ensure readers can fully and accurately understand the findings before this can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n**1. Clarify Which Comparison Led to Which Finding**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The results section combines the findings from comparisons against CPAP and NIPPV, which can be misleading. The key finding about increased treatment failure was only seen when comparing nasal high flow to CPAP, not NIPPV.\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Compared to these other methods, nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD). It may increase the risk of not working well enough within 72 hours...\"\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** To make this clearer, I suggest structuring the results around the specific comparisons. For example:\n    \"Most studies compared nasal high flow therapy with CPAP. In this comparison, nasal high flow was more likely to not work well enough within 72 hours, meaning the baby needed to switch to another type of support. However, this did not lead to an increased need for a breathing tube (mechanical ventilation). Nasal high flow also caused less injury to the baby's nose and fewer cases of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\"\n\n**2. Use Consistent Terminology for Key Outcomes**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The summary uses several different phrases to describe the same concept, which can confuse readers.\n*   **Problematic Text:** You use \"more likely to fail\" in the Key Messages, but \"not working well enough\" in the Results section to describe 'treatment failure'.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Let's choose the clearest phrase and use it every time. \"Not working well enough\" is excellent plain language. I recommend updating the Key Message to match:\n    \"- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely **to not work well enough** within 72 hours, meaning the baby might need to switch to a different type of breathing support.\"\n\n**3. Make Important Definitions Stand Out**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The definitions for CPAP and NIPPV are excellent, but they are embedded in a single, long sentence in the Key Messages, which makes them harder to digest.\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing.\"\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Using a bulleted list makes these key terms much easier for a reader to scan and understand. For example:\n    \"We compared nasal high flow therapy to other breathing support methods that don't use a breathing tube, including:\n    - **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP):** which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open.\n    - **Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV):** which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even clearer and more precise for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms very well to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The text is easy to read, with short sentences and a good use of active voice. The analysis did flag two minor deviations: a high number of nouns ('nouns': P90) and a high number of complex words not on the Dale-Chall list ('complex_words_dc': P90). The high complex word count is expected given the necessary medical terms (e.g., 'pneumothorax', 'bronchopulmonary'), which are well-defined. The high noun count suggests some sentences could be more action-oriented, a point that aligns with the feedback to make the text even more direct."
