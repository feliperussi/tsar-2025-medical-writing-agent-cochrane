  "key_messages": [
    "Research suggests that nasal high flow (a treatment that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs) therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways), for helping preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) breathe, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "Nasal high flow therapy may increase the risk of treatment failure (when a treatment does not work as intended) within 72 hours of starting treatment compared to CPAP, but it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose); however, the quality of the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy.",
    "Future studies should investigate the use of nasal high flow therapy in extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation) and compare its effects to other non-invasive respiratory support methods, as the current evidence is lacking in this area, and it is essential to determine the best treatment options for this vulnerable population."

      "subheading": "What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?",
      "content": "Nasal high flow (nHF) therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation. nHF therapy has emerged as a potential alternative or adjunct to these traditional treatments, offering a gentler and less invasive approach to supporting preterm infants' breathing."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of using nHF therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants, compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). They wanted to determine whether nHF therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or other complications, while also assessing its potential to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation or other interventions. By examining the existing evidence, the authors sought to provide guidance on the effectiveness and safety of nHF therapy for preterm infants with respiratory distress."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including continuous positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The population characteristics included preterm infants born less than 37 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress soon after birth. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions lasted for different durations, but the exact lengths were not specified. There was no information on the funding sources of the studies. We found no studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with ambient oxygen or low flow nasal cannulae. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but probably does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to continuous positive airway pressure."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and lack of randomization, which introduces potential confounding and reduces confidence in the findings.",
