  "draft": "# Is nasal high flow therapy (a treatment that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs) as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n**Key Messages**\n- Research suggests that nasal high flow (a treatment that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs) therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways), for helping preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) breathe, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Nasal high flow therapy may increase the risk of treatment failure (when a treatment does not work as intended) within 72 hours of starting treatment compared to CPAP, but it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose); however, the quality of the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy.\n- Future studies should investigate the use of nasal high flow therapy in extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation) and compare its effects to other non-invasive respiratory support methods, as the current evidence is lacking in this area, and it is essential to determine the best treatment options for this vulnerable population.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?\nNasal high flow (nHF) therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation. nHF therapy has emerged as a potential alternative or adjunct to these traditional treatments, offering a gentler and less invasive approach to supporting preterm infants' breathing.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of using nHF therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants, compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). They wanted to determine whether nHF therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or other complications, while also assessing its potential to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation or other interventions. By examining the existing evidence, the authors sought to provide guidance on the effectiveness and safety of nHF therapy for preterm infants with respiratory distress.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including continuous positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The population characteristics included preterm infants born less than 37 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress soon after birth. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions lasted for different durations, but the exact lengths were not specified. There was no information on the funding sources of the studies. We found no studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with ambient oxygen or low flow nasal cannulae. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but probably does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to continuous positive airway pressure.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and lack of randomization, which introduces potential confounding and reduces confidence in the findings.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

The linguistic analysis strongly supports these observations, indicating the text deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns, particularly in readability, sentence length, vocabulary complexity, and nominalization.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. While the word count is within limits, and active voice and pronoun usage are in the P75 range, nearly 70% of the metrics (12 out of 18) fall into the P90 or Beyond P90 ranges, indicating areas needing substantial improvement. Specifically, readability indices such as `smog_index` (16.04), `dale_chall_readability` (8.68), `automated_readability_index` (15.34), `lix` (61.23), and `rix` (9.03) are all significantly higher than typical, suggesting the text is much harder to read. Sentence structure is problematic, with `words_per_sentence` (24.78) and `passive_voice` (23.0) both in the P90 range. Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, with `nominalization` (39.0), `nouns` (242.0), `complex_words_dc` (374.0), `complex_words` (172.0), and `long_words` (289.0) all falling into the Beyond P90 range, indicating an overuse of complex, long, and noun-heavy language. These deviations collectively point to a text that is too complex and difficult for a general audience.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n*   **Subheading Format:** The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions, which violates the `MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE`.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"Research suggests that nasal high flow (a treatment that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs) therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways), for helping preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) breathe, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This 59-word sentence is extremely long and dense with multiple parenthetical definitions, making it very difficult for a general audience to follow. The `words_per_sentence` metric is in the P90 range (24.78), indicating a consistent issue with sentence length.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Nasal high flow (nHF) therapy provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs.

These other methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which delivers air pressure to keep airways open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which delivers bursts of air pressure. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about nHF's effectiveness.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Vocabulary and Reduce Nominalization:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and lack of randomization, which introduces potential confounding and reduces confidence in the findings.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence uses several technical terms (\"heterogeneity,\" \"intervention delivery methods,\" \"randomization,\" \"confounding\") that are not explained and are too complex for a plain language summary.

The studies included different groups of babies and used different ways to give the treatment. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\"\n\n3.  **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice and Rephrase Subheadings as Questions:**\n    *   **Specific quote (Subheading):** \"Methods\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The `MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE` requires subheadings to be phrased as questions where possible. Additionally, the draft frequently uses passive voice (e.g., \"The studies were conducted...\", \"The interventions lasted for different durations, but the exact lengths were not specified. There was no information on the funding sources of the studies.\"). The `passive_voice` metric is in the P90 range (23.0), indicating a high number of passive constructions.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite (Subheading):** \"How did we do this review?\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite (Example sentence from Results):** \"The studies took place in various countries, but we don't have details about the specific locations.
