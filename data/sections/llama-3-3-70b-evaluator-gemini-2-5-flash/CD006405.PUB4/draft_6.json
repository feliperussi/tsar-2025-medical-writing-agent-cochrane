  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways). However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often have trouble breathing (called respiratory distress) soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or needing to be intubated (having a breathing tube inserted down the throat). Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, a long-term lung condition that can affect premature babies), or other complications. We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies we found used different devices and settings for the treatments. Also, very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on three main areas:\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms and their definitions.** Some medical terms are necessary, but the language used to explain them can be simpler and more direct. For example:\n   - **Quote:** \"...continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways).\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrases 'delivers air pressure' and 'bursts of air pressure' are still quite technical for a lay audience.\n   - **Suggestion:** Try a more patient-friendly explanation, like: \"...continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing.\"\n\n2. **Reduce complex and long words by leading with the simple explanation.** The summary uses several long, technical words that can be challenging, even with definitions. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of long and complex words.\n   - **Quote:** \"We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, a long-term lung condition that can affect premature babies), or other complications.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence introduces the complex term 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia' before the plain language explanation, which can cause readers to stumble.\n   - **Suggestion:** Lead with the simple explanation first to improve flow: \"We wanted to find out if nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death or long-term lung problems (known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD).\"\n\n3. **Make the explanation of limitations more concrete.** The explanation for why a lack of randomization is a problem is a bit vague and could be clearer for readers unfamiliar with research methods.\n   - **Quote:** \"This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\"\n   - **Problem:** This doesn't fully explain to a lay reader *why* 'other factors' are a problem in a study.\n   - **Suggestion:** Consider being more specific to clarify the concept: \"This means that differences between the groups of babies, rather than the treatments themselves, could have affected the results. This makes us less confident in the findings.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis flags significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns (170), Dale-Chall complex words (262), and long words (188) are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more vocabulary-dense than a typical PLS. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and replace long words with more common alternatives to improve reader comprehension."
