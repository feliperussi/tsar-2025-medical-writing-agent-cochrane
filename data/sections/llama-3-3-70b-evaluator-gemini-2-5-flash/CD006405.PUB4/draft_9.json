  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours, meaning the baby might need to switch to a different type of breathing support. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often have trouble breathing soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. We treat preterm infants with breathing problems using CPAP or mechanical ventilation. But these treatments have risks, like injuring the baby's lungs or needing a breathing tube put down their throat. Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death or long-term lung problems (known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD). We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Compared to these other methods, nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD). It may increase the risk of not working well enough within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because in some studies, the treatment a baby received was not chosen randomly. This could mean that differences between the groups of babies, rather than the treatments themselves, caused the results we saw. The studies we found used different devices and settings for the treatments. Also, very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revision to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of unnecessarily technical and dense language, a slightly unclear description of the evidence limitations, and general wordiness. Addressing these points will make the summary more accessible and easier to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify technical language and dense phrasing.** Some sentences are heavy with jargon and nouns, which can make them hard for readers to process. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of nouns and complex words compared to typical summaries.\n   - **Example 1:** \"Nasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Non-invasive respiratory support\" is technical jargon. The two sentences can be combined and simplified.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Nasal high flow therapy is a way to help premature babies breathe without using a breathing tube. It gently provides warm, moist air and oxygen through two small prongs in the baby's nose.\"\n\n   - **Example 2:** \"We aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"primary form of respiratory support\" is wordy and not immediately clear.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for preterm infants.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the limitations of the evidence.** The current explanation of the study methods is a bit vague and could be more direct.\n   - **Example:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because in some studies, the treatment a baby received was not chosen randomly. This could mean that differences between the groups of babies, rather than the treatments themselves, caused the results we saw.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This simplifies the issue of bias in a way that may not be fully accurate (the review included randomized trials but noted high risk of bias). It's clearer to state that the study methods had weaknesses.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited. Some studies had weaknesses in their methods, which means we can't be certain the results were caused by the treatments alone. The studies also used different devices and settings, making them hard to compare.\"\n\n3. **Improve conciseness by removing wordy phrases.** Several sentences can be made more direct and active, as recommended by the style guide.\n   - **Example:** \"We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death or long-term lung problems (known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"determine whether\" is a wordy phrase.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to see if nasal high flow therapy reduces the risk of death or long-term lung problems (called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 8.4). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nouns', 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), and 'long_words' are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is denser and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical language and reduce noun-heavy phrasing."
