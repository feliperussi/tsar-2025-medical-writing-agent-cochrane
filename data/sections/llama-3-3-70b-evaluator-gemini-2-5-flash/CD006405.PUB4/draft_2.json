  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Nasal high flow therapy may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of starting treatment compared to CPAP. But it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation. Nasal high flow therapy offers a gentler and less invasive approach to supporting preterm infants' breathing.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. They compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. The authors wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or other complications. They also assessed its potential to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation or other interventions.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but probably does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence has some limitations. The studies included different groups of babies and used different ways to give the treatment. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make the language more direct and easier for patients to understand.\n\n1. **Use active verbs instead of noun phrases.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences abstract and wordy. Converting these back to simple verbs will make the summary more direct.\n   - **Example:** \"Nasal high flow therapy likely results in a reduction in pneumothorax...\"\n   - **Problem**: The phrase \"results in a reduction in\" is indirect.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite using a direct verb, like: \"Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces pneumothorax...\"\n\n2. **Replace formal or complex words with simpler alternatives.** While the readability scores are good, the draft uses more long and complex words than a typical PLS. Choosing simpler, everyday words will improve clarity.\n   - **Example:** \"They also assessed its potential to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation or other interventions.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Assessed its potential to decrease\" is formal, and \"interventions\" is jargon.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite with simpler terms, like: \"They also looked at whether it could reduce the need for breathing machines or other treatments.\"\n\n3. **Use 'we' consistently when talking about the review authors.** The style guide requires using 'we' and 'our'. The draft starts by referring to \"The review authors\" in the third person before switching to \"we\" later on. Being consistent from the start creates a more personal tone.\n   - **Example:** \"The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite in the first person: \"We aimed to find out the benefits and harms...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is well-structured, but the linguistic analysis supports these suggestions. The metrics for **nominalization**, **nouns**, **complex_words**, and **long_words** are all higher than 90% of typical summaries, confirming the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence construction.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in terms of readability scores and sentence structure, with 67% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and style, with high scores for nominalization, nouns, complex words, and long words (all in the P90 range). This indicates the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, even though sentences are short."
