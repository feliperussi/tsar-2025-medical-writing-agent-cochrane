  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a treatment that delivers air pressure into the airways to keep them open) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV, a treatment that delivers bursts of air pressure into the airways). However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Nasal high flow therapy may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of starting treatment compared to CPAP. But it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support. It provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. Preterm infants often experience respiratory distress soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. Common treatments for respiratory distress in preterm infants include CPAP and mechanical ventilation. However, these treatments can have drawbacks, such as increased risk of lung injury or the need for intubation (inserting a breathing tube down the throat). Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe aimed to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as a primary form of respiratory support in preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to determine whether nasal high flow therapy can reduce the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, a condition that affects the lungs), or other complications. We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. It may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours, but it probably does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have some concerns about the evidence. The studies involved different groups of babies and used the treatments in different ways. Some studies were very small, and not all studies randomly assigned babies to treatments. This means other factors could have affected the results, making us less confident in the findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of complex nouns.**\nSome sentences are less direct because they use noun forms of verbs. Changing these to simple verbs makes the text easier to follow.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Nasal high flow therapy may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of starting treatment compared to CPAP.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"increase the risk of treatment failure\" is abstract and noun-heavy.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours.\"\n\n2. **Add specific details to the 'Limitations' section.**\nThe current explanation of limitations is a bit general. Adding specific examples from the review helps readers better understand the context.\n- **Original sentence:** \"The studies involved different groups of babies and used the treatments in different ways.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This doesn't explain *how* they were different, which is the most important information for the reader.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies we found used different devices and settings for the treatments. Also, very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them.\"\n\n3. **Ensure consistent language when describing findings.**\nThe summary uses different words to describe the certainty of the same finding in different sections, which could be confusing.\n- **In Key Messages:** \"But it **may** also reduce the risk of pneumothorax...\"\n- **In the Results section:** \"Nasal high flow therapy **likely** reduces... pneumothorax...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This inconsistency can make readers unsure about the strength of the evidence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Use the same term in both places for consistency. We recommend using \"likely\" in the Key Message to match the Results: \"But it **likely** also reduces the risk of pneumothorax...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and overall readability scores, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure, with high scores (P90) for nominalization (noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words. This suggests the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using simpler words and more active verb constructions."
