  "draft": "# Is entecavir (a type of antiviral medicine) effective and safe for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B (a long-term liver infection) compared to no treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment)?\n**Key messages**\n- Entecavir (a type of antiviral medicine) may have benefits and unwanted effects for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B (a long-term liver infection), but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear how it compares to no treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment) in terms of all-cause mortality (death from any cause) and serious adverse events (harmful effects), with no reported harmful effects on health-related quality of life (a person's overall well-being).\n- The review found very low-certainty evidence, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of entecavir, particularly in terms of long-term outcomes and in different subgroups of people with chronic hepatitis B.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current evidence, including the lack of data on health-related quality of life and the need for longer-term follow-up, to provide more reliable answers to the question of whether entecavir is effective and safe for people with chronic hepatitis B.\n**Introduction**\n### What is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a problem?\nChronic hepatitis B is a major worldwide public health concern. It is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus that can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, liver cancer, and death. Entecavir is one of the antiviral therapy options used to treat chronic hepatitis B.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of entecavir compared to no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. They aimed to find out whether entecavir is effective in reducing the risk of serious health problems, such as all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and improving health-related quality of life in people with chronic hepatitis B.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing entecavir with no treatment or placebo in people with chronic hepatitis B, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 22 studies that involved 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies were conducted over a period of 5 weeks to 228 weeks. The experimental intervention was oral entecavir, and the comparator in 12 trials was no treatment, and in 10 trials was placebo. Fourteen trials equally administered co-interventions to the trial participants in the entecavir and no treatment and placebo groups. One trial included participants between 14 years and 55 years of age, one trial included only children, 19 trials included only adults, and one trial did not provide the age of participants. This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. Entecavir may reduce or have little to no effect on the proportion of people with serious adverse events, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if entecavir has an effect on all-cause mortality. There is a lack of data on health-related quality of life.\n**Limitations**\nThe limitations of the evidence are that participants may have known which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies were very small.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
