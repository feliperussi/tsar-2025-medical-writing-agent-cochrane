  "draft": "Is entecavir effective and safe for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B?\nWe looked at the benefits and risks of entecavir for people with chronic hepatitis B. \n- Entecavir may have some benefits, but we are not sure about its effects on death from any cause or serious unwanted effects.\n- We do not know if entecavir affects a person's overall well-being, including their physical, emotional, and social health, because no studies reported on this.\n- Future research should focus on providing high-quality evidence about the benefits and harms of entecavir for people with chronic hepatitis B.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a problem?\nChronic hepatitis B is a major public health concern worldwide. It is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus that can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, liver cancer, and even death. The virus is spread through bodily fluids, such as blood and semen, and can be transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during birth. Antiviral medications, such as entecavir, are used to treat chronic hepatitis B and can help slow the progression of the disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of entecavir compared to no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. They aimed to determine the effect of entecavir on critical outcomes such as death from any cause, overall well-being, and the proportion of people with serious unwanted effects. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence and identify any gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing entecavir with no treatment or placebo in people with chronic hepatitis B. We looked at the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 22 studies that involved 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies were conducted over a period of 5 weeks to 228 weeks. One trial included participants between 14 years and 55 years of age, one trial included only children, 19 trials included only adults, and one trial did not provide the age of participants. Entecavir may reduce or have little to no effect on serious unwanted effects in people with chronic hepatitis B, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if entecavir has an effect on death from any cause or overall well-being.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited due to a high or unclear risk of bias in most trials, very small study sizes, few cases of the condition, and an insufficient number of studies to draw confident conclusions.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
