  "draft": "Is entecavir effective and safe for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B compared to no treatment or a placebo?\n\nWe looked at the benefits and harms of entecavir for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. We wanted to know if entecavir is better than no treatment or a placebo in reducing serious health problems and improving quality of life.\n\n- We are very uncertain if entecavir reduces serious harmful effects compared to no treatment or a placebo. The evidence is of very low certainty.\n- We don't know if entecavir affects the risk of death, because no deaths occurred in any group in the studies we found.\n- The studies did not provide data on quality of life.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a problem?\nChronic hepatitis B is a major public health concern worldwide. It is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (a type of virus that attacks the liver) that can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, liver cancer, and death. Entecavir is one of the antiviral therapy options (a type of treatment that fights viruses) used to treat chronic hepatitis B.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of entecavir compared to no treatment or placebo (a dummy treatment) in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. We aimed to find out whether entecavir is effective in reducing the risk of serious health problems, such as death from any cause and serious harmful effects, and improving quality of life.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing entecavir with no treatment or placebo in people with chronic hepatitis B, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 22 studies that involved 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies followed people for 5 to 228 weeks. We are very uncertain if entecavir reduces serious harmful effects compared to no treatment or a placebo. It is unclear if entecavir has an effect on death from any cause, because no deaths were reported in either the entecavir or the placebo/no treatment groups in the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons:\n- In some studies, participants may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\n- The studies were also very small, which makes it hard to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
