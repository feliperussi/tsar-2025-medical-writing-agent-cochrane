  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis, such as corticosteroids and biologics?\n\nKey Messages\n- Corticosteroids are medicines that reduce inflammation. They may improve symptoms like difficulty swallowing and reduce inflammation in the esophagus for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these benefits.\n- Biologics are medicines made from living organisms. They may also reduce inflammation in the esophagus, but their effect on symptoms is less clear. There is limited information about their potential harmful effects.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of these treatments, particularly in the long term, and to determine which treatment is best for which patients.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why is it a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus. It occurs when a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the esophagus in response to an allergen or irritant. This can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Eosinophilic esophagitis can significantly impact a person's quality of life, and there is currently no cure.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical interventions for treating eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of various treatments, including corticosteroids, biologics, and other medications, to determine which ones work best for improving symptoms, reducing inflammation, and enhancing quality of life.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies comparing different medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nHow did we analyze the information?\nTwo review authors independently selected studies and collected the information. We then summarized the results and assessed how confident we were in the evidence using a system called GRADE.\n\nWhat did we look for in the studies?\nWe focused on how well treatments improved symptoms, reduced inflammation, and affected quality of life. We also looked at any unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies compared different medical interventions, including corticosteroids, biologics, and proton pump inhibitor medications, to placebo or other interventions. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms and greatly reduce inflammation in the esophagus, but they may have little to no effect on endoscopic findings. Biologics may not improve symptoms, but they may greatly reduce inflammation in the esophagus.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Please address the following points:\n\n1. **Correct the factual error** about corticosteroids. The review found high‑certainty evidence that corticosteroids *greatly reduce inflammation* in the esophagus. Revise the key message to reflect this accurately.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"We are confident that corticosteroids greatly reduce inflammation in the esophagus (high‑certainty evidence). We are less certain that they improve symptoms like difficulty swallowing (low‑certainty evidence).\"\n\n2. **Explain technical terms** such as \"endoscopic findings\". Use plain language explanations.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"...but they may not change how the esophagus looks during an internal examination with a camera (an endoscopy).\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex language** throughout the summary. Replace jargon with everyday words.\n   - Example rewrite: \"We wanted to find out how well different medical treatments work and if they are safe.\"\n\n4. **Maintain the improved sentence structure** (short sentences, low passive voice) while reducing vocabulary complexity to lower the SMOG index and complex‑word count.\n\nPlease revise the draft accordingly and resubmit for re‑evaluation.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has excellent sentence structure, with short sentences (14.9 words/sentence, P25) and very little passive voice (7 instances, P25). However, it deviates significantly from typical plain‑language summary patterns in vocabulary complexity. The SMOG Index (14.3, P90), complex word count (120, P90), and long word count (173, P90) are all high, indicating that the vocabulary is too technical and difficult for a lay audience. The main priority for revision should be simplifying complex words and explaining necessary medical terms."
