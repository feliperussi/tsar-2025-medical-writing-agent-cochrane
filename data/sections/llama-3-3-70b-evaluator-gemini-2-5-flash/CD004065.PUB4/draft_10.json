  "draft": "# What are the benefits and harms of medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis (a condition where the esophagus becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction), such as corticosteroids and biologics?\n**Key Messages**\n- Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation, a natural response of the body) may lead to improvement in symptoms (such as difficulty swallowing) and histological improvement (reduction of inflammation in the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) in people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a condition where the esophagus becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction), but the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Biologics (medicines that are made from living organisms and are used to treat various diseases) may also lead to histological improvement, but their effect on symptoms is less clear, and there is limited information about their potential harmful effects, such as serious adverse events (unwanted outcomes that can be serious, but are not necessarily caused by the treatment).\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of these treatments, particularly in the long term, and to determine which treatment is best for which patients, as the current evidence does not provide clear answers to these questions.\n**Introduction**\n### What is eosinophilic esophagitis and why is it a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus, which is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It occurs when a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the esophagus in response to an allergen or irritant. This can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, and vomiting. EoE can significantly impact a person's quality of life, and there is currently no cure. Common treatments include dietary modifications, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical interventions for treating eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of various treatments, including corticosteroids, biologics, and other medications, to determine which ones work best for improving symptoms, reducing inflammation, and enhancing quality of life. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence for each treatment to inform healthcare decisions and future research.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n### Data Synthesis\nWe summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n### Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety\nWe evaluated the efficacy and safety of these treatments.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on patients with active disease. The studies compared different medical interventions, including corticosteroids, biologics, and proton pump inhibitor medications, to placebo or other interventions. The duration of the studies was not specified, but they were randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of these interventions for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Corticosteroids may lead to clinical symptom improvement and a large increase in histological improvement, but may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement. Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. Corticosteroids and biologics may have different effects on outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence varies.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
