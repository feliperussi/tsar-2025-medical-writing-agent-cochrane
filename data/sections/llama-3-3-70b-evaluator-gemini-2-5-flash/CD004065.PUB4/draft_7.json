  "draft": "What are the effects of corticosteroids and biologic medicines for people with eosinophilic esophagitis?\n- Corticosteroids may improve symptoms - we have low-certainty evidence for this. They lead to large improvements in the health of the food pipe tissue when checked under a microscope - we have high-certainty evidence for this.\n- Biologics may or may not improve symptoms - some measurements show improvement, while others do not. However, they do improve the health of the food pipe tissue - we have moderate-certainty evidence for this.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus - the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This means the esophagus has too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that causes swelling). EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n\nWhy is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well and how safely different medical treatments work for eosinophilic esophagitis. We compared treatments like corticosteroids and biologics against a placebo (a dummy treatment). We also checked for unwanted side effects and rated how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on those with active disease. We mainly looked to see if treatments improved people's symptoms, the health of their food pipe tissue, and how the food pipe looked in a camera test. We also checked how many people stopped treatment because of side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can make the results less reliable.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand how corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Remember, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your specific condition.",

The linguistic metrics show it conforms very well to typical PLS patterns. To make it even more accessible for patients, I recommend focusing on these three improvements:\n\n1. **Make the 'Why is it a problem?' section more direct.**\n   - **The issue:** The first sentence repeats the question in the subheading instead of answering it directly.\n   - **Original text:** 'Eosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Start the paragraph with the answer: 'The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, which affects a person's quality of life and can lead to malnutrition and weight loss.'\n\n2. **Explain the medical procedure 'dilation'.**\n   - **The issue:** Readers may not be familiar with the medical term 'dilation of the esophagus'.\n   - **Original text:** '...and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Briefly explain the term in plain language: '...and a procedure to gently stretch the food pipe (called dilation) to make swallowing easier.'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language to describe the results.**\n   - **The issue:** The phrase 'the health of their food pipe tissue' is abstract and could be clearer. This relates to the high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs) found in the text, which can make sentences less direct.\n   - **Original text:** 'We mainly looked to see if treatments improved people's symptoms, the health of their food pipe tissue, and how the food pipe looked in a camera test.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Use more descriptive verbs: 'We mainly looked to see if treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced the swelling in their food pipe tissue (seen under a microscope), and improved how the food pipe looked during a camera test.'\n\nBy making these small changes, the summary will be even clearer and more helpful for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile of the reference corpus. Readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.4) and sentence structure metrics (e.g., 16.6 words per sentence) are excellent. The only significant deviation is in 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests an opportunity to replace some abstract nouns with more direct verbs to improve clarity, as noted in the feedback."
