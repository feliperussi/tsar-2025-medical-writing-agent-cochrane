  "draft": "What are the effects of corticosteroids and biologic medicines for people with eosinophilic esophagitis? \n- Corticosteroids may help improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis and may also improve the health of the food pipe tissue when samples are checked under a microscope. However, we are not very confident in this evidence because its quality is not strong.\n- Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\n- Further research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of corticosteroids and biologics for people with eosinophilic esophagitis, including how well they work in the long term, and to find out which treatments work best for which people, as the current evidence does not provide clear answers to these questions.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis? \nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus - the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This means the esophagus has too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that causes swelling). EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n\nWhy is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem? \nEosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out how well and how safely different medical treatments work for eosinophilic esophagitis. We compared treatments like corticosteroids and biologics against a placebo (a dummy treatment). We also checked for unwanted side effects and rated how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nHow did we conduct this review? \nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on those with active disease. The interventions compared included corticosteroids, biologics, and placebo, with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events.\n\nWhat were the main results? \nCorticosteroids may help reduce symptoms. They also improved the health of the food pipe tissue when samples were checked under a microscope. However, they may not have changed the way the food pipe looked to the naked eye during a camera test (endoscopy). Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can make the results less reliable.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand how corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Remember, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your specific condition.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While the structure and length are good, there are critical factual inaccuracies in the key messages that misrepresent the review's findings. Additionally, the vocabulary is too complex and noun-heavy for a lay audience, making key sections difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Factual Inaccuracy on Corticosteroid Certainty:** The summary incorrectly states that the evidence for tissue improvement is weak, which contradicts the source abstract.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Corticosteroids may help improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis and may also improve the health of the food pipe tissue when samples are checked under a microscope. However, we are not very confident in this evidence because its quality is not strong.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a significant factual error. The original abstract states there is 'high certainty' for histological (tissue) improvement. Misrepresenting the certainty of a key finding could mislead patients and clinicians.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Corticosteroids may improve symptoms (low-certainty evidence). They lead to large improvements in the health of the food pipe tissue when checked under a microscope (high-certainty evidence).\"\n\n2. **Clarify the Contradictory Findings on Biologics:** The draft's summary of biologics is overly negative and contradicts the source materials.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This statement is confusing and doesn't align with the source of truth, which says biologics 'may also help improve symptoms'. The original abstract explains this nuance (improvement was seen when measured one way, but not another). The current wording is an oversimplification that could be misinterpreted.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For biologics, the effect on symptoms is uncertain; some measurements showed an improvement while others did not. However, they do improve the health of the food pipe tissue (moderate-certainty evidence).\"\n\n3. **Simplify Complex, Noun-Heavy Sentences:** Many sentences are filled with technical terms and use noun forms instead of active verbs, which makes them hard to read.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The interventions compared included corticosteroids, biologics, and placebo, with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence contains multiple technical terms ('interventions', 'primary outcomes', 'histological', 'endoscopic') and nominalizations ('improvement', 'withdrawals'). It forces the reader to process too much complex information at once.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared treatments like corticosteroids and biologics to a placebo (a dummy treatment). We mainly looked to see if treatments improved people's symptoms, the health of their food pipe tissue, and how the food pipe looked in a camera test. We also checked how many people stopped treatment because of side effects.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your own editorial judgment is confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very high number of `long_words` (Beyond P90), `complex_words` (P90), and `nominalization` (P90). Addressing the issues above will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a Plain Language Summary and significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and active voice are good (P25/P75), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary. Six metrics are in the P90 range or beyond, including `long_words` (BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (P90), `smog_index` (P90), and `nominalization` (P90). This indicates the text uses vocabulary that is much more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which will make it difficult for readers to understand."
