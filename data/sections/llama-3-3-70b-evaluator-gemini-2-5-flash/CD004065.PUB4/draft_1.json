  "draft": "# How corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis\n**Key Messages**\n- Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation, or swelling) may help improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (a condition where the esophagus, or food pipe, becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction), and may also improve the appearance of the esophagus when looked at with an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera), but the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in these findings.\n- Biologics (medicines that are made from living things, like cells, and are used to treat various diseases) may also help improve symptoms and the appearance of the esophagus, but again, the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in these findings, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects.\n- Further research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of corticosteroids and biologics for people with eosinophilic esophagitis, including how well they work in the long term, and to find out which treatments work best for which people, as the current evidence does not provide clear answers to these questions.\n**Introduction**\n### What is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This inflammation is characterized by the presence of a high number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the esophagus. EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n### Why is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the outcomes of various treatments, including corticosteroids and biologics, with placebo or other interventions. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence for these treatments and identify any potential adverse effects. By doing so, they hoped to provide a comprehensive overview of the best treatment options for people with EoE.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on those with active disease. The interventions compared included corticosteroids, biologics, and placebo, with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events. Eleven studies included pediatric patients, while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease, while the rest were in patients with active disease.\n### Main results: Treatment outcomes for eosinophilic esophagitis\nCorticosteroids may lead to clinical symptom improvement and a large increase in histological improvement, but may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement. Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and the potential for participants to know which treatment they received, introducing bias.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 8 out of 18 features deviating from the best quartile. Notably, 'nominalization' (33.0) is Beyond P90, and 'smog_index' (15.77), 'complex_words' (161.0), and 'long_words' (243.0) are also Beyond P90, suggesting significant deviations in vocabulary complexity and overall readability. 'Nouns' (190.0), 'lix' (58.64), 'rix' (8.38), and 'complex_words_dc' (275.0) are in the P90 range, further highlighting the need for simplification in language and sentence structure. The 'flesch_reading_ease' is in the P25 range (36.63), and several grade-level metrics ('flesch_kincaid_grade', 'automated_readability_index', 'coleman_liau_index', 'gunning_fog_index') are in the P75 range, all pointing to a text that is more difficult to read than typical PLS documents."
