  "draft": "How corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nKey messages:\n- Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce swelling) may improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis and how the food pipe looks. However, we are not very confident in this evidence because its quality is not strong.\n- Biologics (medicines made from living things, like cells) may also help improve symptoms and the appearance of the esophagus, but again, the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in these findings, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects.\n- Further research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of corticosteroids and biologics for people with eosinophilic esophagitis, including how well they work in the long term, and to find out which treatments work best for which people, as the current evidence does not provide clear answers to these questions.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus - the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This means the esophagus has too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that causes swelling). EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n\nWhy is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well and how safely different medical treatments work for eosinophilic esophagitis. We compared treatments like corticosteroids and biologics against a placebo (a dummy treatment). We also checked for unwanted side effects and rated how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on those with active disease. The interventions compared included corticosteroids, biologics, and placebo, with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCorticosteroids may help reduce symptoms. They also improved the health of the food pipe tissue when samples were checked under a microscope. However, they may not have changed the way the food pipe looked to the naked eye during a camera test (endoscopy). Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and the potential for participants to know which treatment they received, introducing bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand how corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Remember, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your specific condition.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There are critical factual errors in the 'Key messages' section that misrepresent the review's findings on biologics. The main title also does not follow the required question format. Additionally, the summary uses complex vocabulary and noun-heavy phrases that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Critical Issues to Fix:**\n\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy in Key Messages:** The summary of findings for biologics is incorrect and overly optimistic in the key messages.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Biologics... may also help improve symptoms and the appearance of the esophagus...\"\n    *   **Problem:** This contradicts the main results section and the original abstract, which state that biologics may result in 'little to no difference in clinical improvement'. The key messages must accurately reflect the review's findings.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Please revise this key message to align with the 'Main results' section, which more accurately states: \"Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\"\n\n2.  **Title Format:** The main title must be a question.\n    *   **Quote:** \"How corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis\"\n    *   **Problem:** The style guide requires the main title to be phrased as a question to engage the reader.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What are the effects of corticosteroids and biologic medicines for people with eosinophilic esophagitis?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex and Technical Language:** The text uses research-specific terms without clear, simple explanations.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and the potential for participants to know which treatment they received, introducing bias.\"\n    *   **Problem:** Phrases like 'study sample sizes' and 'introducing bias' are jargon. This makes the limitations of the evidence hard for a non-researcher to grasp.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can make the results less reliable.\"\n\n2.  **Replace Noun Phrases with Verbs:** The summary often uses nouns where verbs would be clearer and more direct. This is known as 'nominalization'.\n    *   **Quote:** \"...the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence structure is passive and noun-heavy, making it dense and difficult to read.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We mainly looked to see if treatments improved people's symptoms, the health of their food pipe tissue, and how the food pipe looked in a camera test. We also counted how many people left studies because of unwanted side effects.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify Technical Outcomes Upfront:** Key terms are used before they are explained, which can confuse readers.\n    *   **Quote:** \"...with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement...\"\n    *   **Problem:** The terms 'histological' and 'endoscopic' are used together here, but the plain language explanations ('checked under a microscope', 'camera test') don't appear until the next section. Readers may not know what these mean.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** When first mentioning these outcomes, explain them immediately. For example: \"We looked for improvement in people's symptoms (clinical improvement), in their food pipe tissue when seen under a microscope (histological improvement), and in how the food pipe looked during a camera test (endoscopic improvement).\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While sentence-level metrics like length and readability are strong (mostly in the best quartile), the vocabulary is significantly more complex than is typical for PLS texts. Metrics for complex words, long words, and the SMOG index are all in the P90 range or beyond, indicating the word choice is a key barrier to readability. The text also relies heavily on nouns and nominalizations (P90), supporting the editorial feedback to use more active verbs to improve clarity."
