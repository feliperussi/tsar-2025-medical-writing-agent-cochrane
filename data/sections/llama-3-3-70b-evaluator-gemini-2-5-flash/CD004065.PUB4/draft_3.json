  "draft": "How corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nKey messages:\n- Corticosteroids may help improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis - a condition where the esophagus becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. They may also improve the appearance of the esophagus when looked at with an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera). However, the quality of the evidence is not strong.\n- Biologics may also help improve symptoms and the appearance of the esophagus. But again, the quality of the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects.\n- Further research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of corticosteroids and biologics for people with eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus - the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This inflammation is characterized by the presence of a high number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the esophagus. EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n\nWhy is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the outcomes of various treatments, including corticosteroids and biologics, with placebo or other interventions. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence for these treatments and identify any potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients. The interventions compared included corticosteroids, biologics, and placebo, with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCorticosteroids may lead to clinical symptom improvement and a large increase in histological improvement, but may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement. Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and the potential for participants to know which treatment they received, introducing bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand how corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Remember, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your specific condition.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's a good start, but it needs some revisions to make it clearer for a lay audience. The main issues are a missing 'Methods' section and the use of overly technical language without clear definitions. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Methods' section.** The summary needs to briefly explain how the review was done. Please add a new section with a question as a subheading.\n   - **Suggested Subheading:** \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n   - **Suggested Text (from source):** \"We searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and abstract language.** The draft contains formal, noun-heavy phrases that make it hard to read. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a very high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs).\n   - **Example Quote:** \"This inflammation is characterized by the presence of a high number of eosinophils...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. Using simple verbs makes the text more accessible.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This means the esophagus has too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that causes swelling).\"\n\n3. **Define all technical terms in the results.** The 'Main results' section uses a key term that readers won't understand.\n   - **Example Quote:** \"...and a large increase in histological improvement...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Histological improvement' is unexplained jargon. Readers need to know what this means to understand the findings.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...and a large improvement in the tissue of the esophagus when viewed under a microscope (histological improvement).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity in sentence structure, with appropriate sentence length (16.85 words, P25) and high use of active voice (55%, P75). However, the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics are in the P90 range or beyond, most notably 'nominalization' (BEYOND_P90), 'smog_index' (BEYOND_P90), and 'complex_words' (P90). This indicates that while sentences are short, they are filled with overly technical, abstract, and noun-heavy language, making the text difficult for a lay audience to understand."
