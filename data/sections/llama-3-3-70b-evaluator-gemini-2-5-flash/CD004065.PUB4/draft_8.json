  "draft": "What are the effects of corticosteroids and biologic medicines for people with eosinophilic esophagitis?\n- Corticosteroids may improve symptoms - we have low-certainty evidence for this. They lead to large improvements in the health of the food pipe tissue when checked under a microscope - we have high-certainty evidence for this.\n- Biologics may or may not improve symptoms - some measurements show improvement, while others do not. However, they do improve the health of the food pipe tissue - we have moderate-certainty evidence for this.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus - the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This means the esophagus has too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that causes swelling). EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n\nWhy is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem?\nThe symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, which affects a person's quality of life and can lead to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and a procedure to gently stretch the food pipe (called dilation) to make swallowing easier. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well and how safely different medical treatments work for eosinophilic esophagitis. We compared treatments like corticosteroids and biologics against a placebo (a dummy treatment). We also checked for unwanted side effects and rated how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on those with active disease. We mainly looked to see if treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced the swelling in their food pipe tissue (seen under a microscope), and improved how the food pipe looked during a camera test. We also checked how many people stopped treatment because of side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can make the results less reliable.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand how corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Remember, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your specific condition.",

Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the language in the Key Messages.** The explanation for tissue improvement is a bit long and clinical, which could be challenging for readers at the very start of the summary.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'They lead to large improvements in the health of the food pipe tissue when checked under a microscope - we have high-certainty evidence for this.'\n    *   **Consider:** 'They greatly improve the food pipe tissue (based on samples viewed under a microscope). We are very confident in this finding.'\n\n2. **Use more direct, active verbs instead of noun forms.** The summary relies heavily on nouns made from verbs (a feature called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences feel less direct. The linguistic analysis confirms this is an area for improvement.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and a procedure to gently stretch the food pipe? (called dilation) to make swallowing easier.'\n    *   **Consider:** 'To treat EoE, doctors may change a person's diet, prescribe medications to reduce swelling, or perform a procedure that gently stretches the food pipe (dilation).'\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology for the 'esophagus'.** You do a great job defining the esophagus as the 'food pipe' early on. For maximum clarity, stick to the simpler term 'food pipe' throughout the rest of the summary after the initial definition.\n    *   **For example, in:** 'If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus...'\n    *   **Change to:** 'If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the food pipe...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows high conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Metrics for sentence length, active voice, and readability are all excellent. The single notable deviation is in 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests an opportunity to make the text more direct and active by converting some of these nouns back into verbs, as highlighted in the feedback."
