  "draft": "How corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nKey messages:\n- Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation, or swelling) may help improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (a condition where the esophagus, or food pipe, becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction), and may also improve the appearance of the esophagus when looked at with an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera), but the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in these findings.\n- Biologics (medicines that are made from living things, like cells, and are used to treat various diseases) may also help improve symptoms and the appearance of the esophagus, but again, the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in these findings, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects.\n- Further research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of corticosteroids and biologics for people with eosinophilic esophagitis, including how well they work in the long term, and to find out which treatments work best for which people, as the current evidence does not provide clear answers to these questions.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus - the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach - becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. This means the esophagus has too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that causes swelling). EoE can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and chest pain. It is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and eczema.\n\nWhy is eosinophilic esophagitis a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a problem because it can significantly affect a person's quality of life. The symptoms of EoE can make eating and swallowing difficult, leading to malnutrition and weight loss. If left untreated, EoE can also lead to complications like narrowing of the esophagus, which can cause food to get stuck. Current treatments for EoE include dietary changes, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing. However, there is no cure for EoE, and long-term treatment is often necessary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the outcomes of various treatments, including corticosteroids and biologics, with placebo or other interventions. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence for these treatments and identify any potential adverse effects. By doing so, they hoped to provide a comprehensive overview of the best treatment options for people with EoE.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on those with active disease. The interventions compared included corticosteroids, biologics, and placebo, with the primary outcomes being clinical, histological, and endoscopic improvement, as well as withdrawals due to adverse events. Eleven studies included pediatric patients, while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease, while the rest were in patients with active disease.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCorticosteroids may lead to clinical symptom improvement and a large increase in histological improvement (which means the tissue of the esophagus looks better under a microscope), but may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement (which refers to the appearance of the esophagus when looked at with an endoscope). Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead to a large increase in histological improvement. It is unclear if biologics have an effect on endoscopic improvement.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and the potential for participants to know which treatment they received, introducing bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand how corticosteroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis. Remember, it's essential to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your specific condition.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and complete, but it needs significant revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too complex and academic, making it difficult to understand the key findings. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the Key Messages.** The first key message is a single, 69-word sentence packed with three parenthetical definitions. This makes the most important takeaway very difficult to follow.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation, or swelling) may help improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (a condition where the esophagus, or food pipe, becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction), and may also improve the appearance of the esophagus when looked at with an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera), but the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in these findings.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Break this into shorter, more focused points. Define the key terms in the main text, not in the summary message. For example: \"- Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce swelling) may improve the symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis and how the food pipe looks. However, we are not very confident in this evidence because its quality is not strong.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex, noun-heavy sentences with simpler, verb-focused language.** Several sections use formal, academic phrasing instead of plain language. This makes the text dense and hard to read.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the outcomes of various treatments... The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence for these treatments and identify any potential adverse effects.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Use active verbs and simpler words. For example: \"We wanted to find out how well and how safely different medical treatments work for eosinophilic esophagitis. We compared treatments like corticosteroids and biologics against a placebo (a dummy treatment). We also checked for unwanted side effects and rated how certain we were in the evidence.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the main results.** The distinction between 'histological' and 'endoscopic' improvement is technical and may confuse readers. The current phrasing is repetitive and doesn't clearly explain the difference in practical terms.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Corticosteroids may lead to clinical symptom improvement and a large increase in histological improvement (which means the tissue of the esophagus looks better under a microscope), but may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement (which refers to the appearance of the esophagus when looked at with an endoscope).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Focus on what the findings mean for a patient. For example: \"Corticosteroids may help reduce symptoms. They also improved the health of the food pipe tissue when samples were checked under a microscope. However, they may not have changed the way the food pipe looked to the naked eye during a camera test (endoscopy).\"\n\nAdditionally, there is a repeated sentence in the 'What did we find?' section that should be removed. Addressing these points will make the summary much more accessible and useful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like active voice and pronoun use are good, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics are far outside the typical range (Beyond P90): nominalization (use of noun forms instead of verbs), complex words (3+ syllables), long words (7+ characters), Dale-Chall complex words, and the SMOG readability index. These results confirm that the draft's vocabulary is too academic and is the primary barrier to readability."
