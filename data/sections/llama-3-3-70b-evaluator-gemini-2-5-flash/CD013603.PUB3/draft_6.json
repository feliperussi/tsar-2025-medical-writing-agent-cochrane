  "draft": "What are healthcare workers' experiences and views on integrating primary healthcare services?\n\nWe wanted to map out the research on healthcare workers' experiences with combining different health services. Understanding their views is key to making this approach work. We found that the research is very diverse, covering many different settings and types of healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) integration means providing healthcare services together, rather than separately. This approach aims to give patients well-rounded and organized care, especially in areas with limited resources. PHC integration can improve people's health, make care feel more joined-up, and help healthcare systems run better.\n\nWhy is it important to understand healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration?\nHealthcare workers play a crucial role in making PHC integration successful. Their opinions and experiences can influence how well PHC integration works. By looking at what healthcare workers think and feel, we can understand what helps or hinders PHC integration and learn how to improve it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to gather and summarize the existing research on healthcare workers' opinions and experiences with PHC integration. We aimed to understand the different views and experiences of healthcare workers and how these might impact PHC integration.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe conducted a 'scoping review' to map out all the available research on this topic. We searched for studies that used methods like interviews and focus groups to explore healthcare workers' opinions and experiences with PHC integration. We then summarized the types of studies we found.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 184 studies that met our criteria. Most of these studies were published in the last 12 years, with many more being published in the last 5 years. The studies showed that healthcare workers have varying opinions and experiences with PHC integration. We identified 6 different areas where healthcare services were being combined, including:\n- Mental and behavioral health\n- HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health\n- Maternal, women, and child health\n- Non-communicable diseases\n- General primary healthcare services\n- Allied and specialized services\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to July 2020.\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Healthcare workers have different opinions and experiences with integrating primary healthcare services.\n- The review highlights the diversity in primary healthcare integration, including different health service areas, integration strategies, and types of healthcare workers.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the impact of primary healthcare integration on healthcare workers and patients, especially in terms of long-term effects and potential unintended consequences.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and clear, but it requires revision due to a critical issue in the 'Limitations' section that misrepresents the nature of a scoping review. Here are the most important improvements needed:\n\n**1. Critical Issue: Revise the Misleading 'Limitations' Section**\n\nThe current statement about 'confidence in the evidence' is not appropriate for a scoping review, which maps existing research rather than assessing the certainty of findings for an intervention.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This language is used for reviews that assess the effectiveness of a treatment. For a scoping review, the limitations are about the *gaps* in the research map (e.g., what topics or regions were not covered). This statement could confuse readers about the purpose of your review.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This review mapped the available research but did not combine the results to answer a specific question about whether integration works. We found that most studies were from a few specific countries, such as the USA and South Africa, and very few studies looked at healthcare workers' experiences over a long period of time.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Repetitive Sentences in the Aims**\n\nThe section explaining the review's goal uses repetitive phrasing that can be streamlined.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"We wanted to gather and summarize the existing research on healthcare workers' opinions and experiences with PHC integration. We aimed to understand the different views and experiences of healthcare workers and how these might impact PHC integration.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The two sentences say nearly the same thing, repeating phrases like \"opinions/views and experiences\" and \"PHC integration.\" This makes the text feel slow and wordy.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to gather and summarize the existing research on healthcare workers' experiences with combining health services. Our goal was to understand their different views and how these might affect this approach.\"\n\n**3. Shorten Long and Technical Subheading**\n\nOne subheading is overly long and uses technical language, which can be simplified for easier navigation.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Why is it important to understand healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration?\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This question is long and contains the jargon term \"perceptions.\" A shorter, more direct question would be more effective for readers scanning the document.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Why are healthcare workers' views important?\"\n\nAddressing these points, especially the critical issue in the limitations, will ensure the summary is both easy to understand and an accurate representation of the scoping review's methodology and findings.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis also flagged a high number of long words ('long_words' percentile: P90) and noun-form verbs ('nominalization' percentile: P90). This supports the editorial feedback to simplify wordy phrases and replace technical terms with more common language to improve reader experience."
