  "draft": "# What are healthcare workers' experiences and views on integrating primary healthcare services?\n**Key Messages**\n- Healthcare workers have varied experiences and views on integrating primary healthcare services, with benefits including improved delivery of services, but harmful effects were not explicitly reported in the review.\n- The review highlights the diversity in primary healthcare integration interventions, including different health service streams, integration strategies, and healthcare worker populations, which can inform future research and decision-making.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of primary healthcare integration on healthcare workers and patients, particularly in terms of long-term effects and potential unintended consequences, and to address the gaps in the current evidence base.\n**Introduction**\n## What is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) integration refers to the delivery of PHC services together, rather than as separate or 'vertical' health programs. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, especially in low-resource settings. PHC integration is important because it can help improve health outcomes, reduce fragmentation of care, and increase efficiency in healthcare systems.\n## Why is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration important?\nHealthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the success of PHC integration. Their perceptions and experiences can influence the implementation, delivery, and impact of PHC integration. However, the evidence base on this topic is heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in PHC integration. By examining the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences, researchers can gain insights into the factors that influence the success of PHC integration and identify areas for improvement.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. They wanted to characterise the evidence base, identify the diversity of healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences, and explore the factors that influence the implementation and impact of PHC integration. By doing so, the authors aimed to inform future syntheses on the topic and provide insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals working in PHC integration.\n**Methods**\n## Search Strategy\nWe conducted a systematic search for studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding the integration of primary healthcare services. This involved selecting relevant databases, defining keyword combinations, and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify eligible literature.\n## Data Summarization\nThe selected studies were summarized to extract key findings on how healthcare workers perceive integration, the challenges they encounter, and the facilitators they identify. Summaries highlighted common themes, variations across settings, and reported outcomes related to integration efforts.\n## Evidence Evaluation\nWe evaluated the quality and relevance of the evidence to determine the role of healthcare workers in shaping implementation efforts and the impact of integration on service delivery. This assessment considered study design, methodological rigor, and the applicability of findings to inform future integration strategies.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nThe review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross-sectional qualitative design, and few used longitudinal or ethnographic designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. There were gaps in the geographical spread for both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries and some countries were more dominant, such as the USA for high-income countries, South Africa for middle-income countries, and Uganda for low-income countries. Methods were mainly cross-sectional observational studies with few longitudinal studies. A minority of studies used an analytical conceptual model to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the integration study. The main finding was the various levels of diversity found in the evidence base on PHC integration studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences. The review identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated and these were categorised as: mental and behavioural health; HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health; maternal, women, and child health; non-communicable diseases; and two broader categories, namely general PHC services, and allied and specialised services. Within the health streams, the review mapped the scope of the interventions as full or partial integration. The review mapped the use of three different integration strategies and categorised these as horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage strategies. The wide range of healthcare workers who participated in the implementation of integration interventions was mapped and these included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay healthcare workers, and health system support staff. We mapped the range of client target populations. The review found that healthcare workers have varying perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration, which may influence the success of implementation efforts. The evidence base is diverse, with different country settings, study types, client populations, healthcare worker populations, and intervention focus, scope, and strategies. It is unclear how the diversity in primary healthcare integration intervention design, implementation, and context may impact healthcare workers' shaping of primary healthcare integration impact.\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",

The text is 951 words, exceeding the 850-word limit. The subheadings in the 'Methods' section are not phrased as questions, violating the style guide. Furthermore, the language is overly complex, with many long, noun-heavy sentences and instances of passive voice, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. This is strongly supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows significant deviations from typical Plain Language Summary patterns across almost all readability and vocabulary complexity metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns. Only 4 out of 18 features (22.2%) fall within the best quartile. A large majority, 11 features (61.1%), are 'Beyond P90' or 'Below P10', indicating substantial deviation. Key areas of concern include:\n-   **Readability:** Flesch Reading Ease (25.87, P10) is very low, while Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.56, P90), Automated Readability Index (17.13, BEYOND_P90), Gunning Fog Index (19.69, P90), SMOG Index (18.56, BEYOND_P90), LIX (64.68, BEYOND_P90), and RIX (9.72, BEYOND_P90) are all very high, suggesting the text is much too difficult for the target audience.\n-   **Vocabulary Complexity:** Metrics like nominalization (60.00, BEYOND_P90), nouns (341.00, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (451.00, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (242.00, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (389.00, BEYOND_P90) are all extremely high, confirming the use of overly complex and academic language.\n-   **Sentence Structure:** Words per sentence (23.77, P75) is on the higher side, and passive voice (17.00, P75) is also in the upper quartile, contributing to the difficulty.\nThese metrics strongly support the need for significant simplification, shorter sentences, and more direct language to improve readability and conform to plain language guidelines."
