      "subheading": "What is primary healthcare integration?",
      "content": "Primary healthcare (PHC) integration refers to the delivery of PHC services together, rather than as separate or 'vertical' health programs. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, especially in low-resource settings. PHC integration is important because it can help improve health outcomes, reduce fragmentation of care, and increase efficiency in healthcare systems."

      "subheading": "Why is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration important?",
      "content": "Healthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the success of PHC integration. Their perceptions and experiences can influence the implementation, delivery, and impact of PHC integration. However, the evidence base on this topic is heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in PHC integration. By examining the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences, researchers can gain insights into the factors that influence the success of PHC integration and identify areas for improvement."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. They wanted to characterise the evidence base, identify the diversity of healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences, and explore the factors that influence the implementation and impact of PHC integration. By doing so, the authors aimed to inform future syntheses on the topic and provide insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals working in PHC integration."

      "content": "We conducted a systematic search for studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding the integration of primary healthcare services. This involved selecting relevant databases, defining keyword combinations, and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify eligible literature."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross-sectional qualitative design, and few used longitudinal or ethnographic designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. There were gaps in the geographical spread for both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries and some countries were more dominant, such as the USA for high-income countries, South Africa for middle-income countries, and Uganda for low-income countries. Methods were mainly cross-sectional observational studies with few longitudinal studies. A minority of studies used an analytical conceptual model to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the integration study. The main finding was the various levels of diversity found in the evidence base on PHC integration studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences. The review identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated and these were categorised as: mental and behavioural health; HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health; maternal, women, and child health; non-communicable diseases; and two broader categories, namely general PHC services, and allied and specialised services. Within the health streams, the review mapped the scope of the interventions as full or partial integration. The review mapped the use of three different integration strategies and categorised these as horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage strategies. The wide range of healthcare workers who participated in the implementation of integration interventions was mapped and these included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay healthcare workers, and health system support staff. We mapped the range of client target populations. The review found that healthcare workers have varying perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration, which may influence the success of implementation efforts. The evidence base is diverse, with different country settings, study types, client populations, healthcare worker populations, and intervention focus, scope, and strategies. It is unclear how the diversity in primary healthcare integration intervention design, implementation, and context may impact healthcare workers' shaping of primary healthcare integration impact."
