  "draft": "What are healthcare workers' experiences and views on integrating primary healthcare services?\n\nWe looked at what healthcare workers think about combining different healthcare services into one. This approach can lead to better care for patients. However, we found that healthcare workers have different opinions and experiences with this approach.\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) integration means providing healthcare services together, rather than separately. This approach aims to give patients well-rounded and organized care, especially in areas with limited resources. PHC integration can improve people's health, lead to less disconnected care, and help healthcare systems run better.\n\nWhy is it important to understand healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration?\nHealthcare workers play a crucial role in making PHC integration successful. Their opinions and experiences can influence how well PHC integration works. By looking at what healthcare workers think and feel, we can understand what helps or hinders PHC integration and learn how to improve it.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to gather and summarize the existing research on healthcare workers' opinions and experiences with PHC integration. They aimed to understand the different views and experiences of healthcare workers and how these might impact PHC integration.\n\nHow did the authors conduct the review?\nWe conducted a 'scoping review' to map out all the available research on this topic. We searched for studies that used methods like interviews and focus groups to explore healthcare workers' opinions and experiences with PHC integration. We then summarized the types of studies we found.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 184 studies that met our criteria. Most of these studies were published in the last 12 years, with many more being published in the last 5 years. The studies showed that healthcare workers have varying opinions and experiences with PHC integration. We identified 6 different areas where healthcare services were being combined, including:\n- Mental and behavioral health\n- HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health\n- Maternal, women, and child health\n- Non-communicable diseases\n- General primary healthcare services\n- Allied and specialized services\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is the wide variety of studies we found. Because the studies looked at different settings, healthcare workers, and integration methods, it is difficult to combine their findings to make single, clear conclusions. This review provides a map of the research, which can help future researchers ask more specific questions.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to July 2020.\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Healthcare workers have different opinions and experiences with integrating primary healthcare services.\n- The review highlights the diversity in primary healthcare integration, including different health service areas, integration strategies, and types of healthcare workers.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the impact of primary healthcare integration on healthcare workers and patients, especially in terms of long-term effects and potential unintended consequences.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and clear in many areas, but it cannot be approved due to a critical factual error in the 'Limitations' section and a few key areas for improvement.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy**\n\n   1. **The 'Limitations' section is incorrect.** It describes the diversity of the evidence, which is a *finding* of this scoping review, not a limitation regarding the evidence quality.\n   - **Your text:** \"The main limitation is the wide variety of studies we found. Because the studies looked at different settings, healthcare workers, and integration methods, it is difficult to combine their findings to make single, clear conclusions.\"\n   - **Problem:** This misrepresents the certainty of the evidence. The source material states there is low confidence for specific reasons.\n   - **Suggested rewrite (from source):** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1. **Use 'we' consistently for the review team.** The summary switches between \"we\" and \"the authors,\" which can be confusing for readers. Stick to the first-person plural as per the style guide.\n   - **Your text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The authors wanted to gather and summarize...\"\n   - **Problem:** Inconsistent point of view.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to gather and summarize...\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex vocabulary.** The draft uses some words that may be unfamiliar to a general audience. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of complex and long words.\n   - **Your text:** \"...lead to less disconnected care...\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Disconnected care\" is a professional term. A simpler phrase would be more effective.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...make care feel more joined-up...\"\n\n3. **Clarify the opening summary.** The first paragraph is a bit vague and could more directly state the review's purpose.\n   - **Your text:** \"We looked at what healthcare workers think about combining different healthcare services into one. This approach can lead to better care for patients. However, we found that healthcare workers have different opinions and experiences with this approach.\"\n   - **Problem:** It's a bit simplistic and doesn't fully capture the 'scoping review' nature.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to map out the research on healthcare workers' experiences with combining different health services of different health services. Understanding their views is key to making this approach work. We found that the research is very diverse, covering many different settings and types of healthcare workers.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features falling in the best quartile. Strengths include excellent sentence length (16.7 words), low passive voice (4 instances), and strong readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10.6). However, the analysis identified significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The number of Dale-Chall complex words (218) and long words (193) are in the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a PLS and supporting the recommendation to simplify specific terms."
