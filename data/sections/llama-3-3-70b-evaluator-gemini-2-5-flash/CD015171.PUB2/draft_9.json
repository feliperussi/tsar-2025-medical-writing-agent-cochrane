  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medications, such as betahistine, for people with Ménière’s disease?\n- The benefits and harms of these medications are unclear, including their potential effects on vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the effectiveness of different medications, including betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids, in preventing vertigo attacks and improving symptoms in people with Ménière’s disease.\n- Future research should focus on what matters most to people with Ménière’s disease. This includes reducing vertigo, improving hearing, and minimizing unwanted effects. Better evidence will help guide treatment decisions and improve quality of life.\n\nWhat is Ménière's disease and why is it a problem?\nMénière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. While the exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, various treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids have been used to manage its symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medications for people with Ménière's disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing medications to placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Ménière's disease. The studies evaluated the following medications: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. Most studies lasted for around 3 to 12 months. The evidence for these medications was of low or very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and the studies did not look at all the different types of people, treatments, or results that we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
