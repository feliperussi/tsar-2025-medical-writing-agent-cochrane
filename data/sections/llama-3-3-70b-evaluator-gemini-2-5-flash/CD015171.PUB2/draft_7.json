  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medications, such as betahistine, for people with Ménière’s disease?\nWe looked at the evidence on medications like betahistine for Ménière’s disease. \n- The benefits and harms of these medications are unclear. \n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine their effectiveness in preventing vertigo attacks and improving symptoms. \n- Future research should focus on finding the most effective treatments and outcomes that matter to people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nWhat is Ménière's disease and why is it a problem?\nMénière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. The exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, but various treatments like betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids are used to manage its symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medications for people with Ménière's disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Ménière's disease. The studies evaluated the following medications: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. Most studies lasted for around 3 to 12 months. The evidence for these medications was of low or very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and lack of coverage across all populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

It has a critical structural issue and several areas that need clarification to be helpful for patients and their families.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\n*   **Missing Required Section:** The draft is missing the 'Methods' section. Readers need to understand how the review was conducted. Please add a subheading and the relevant information.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Add the missing 'Methods' section.** A plain language summary must briefly explain how the evidence was found and evaluated. \n    *   **Suggested Addition:** Add a new section with the heading \"How did we conduct the review?\" and include the following text, based on the source material: \"We searched for studies that compared medications to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2.  **Explain what 'certainty of evidence' means.** The summary uses a technical term without explaining its practical meaning for the reader.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence for these medications was of low or very low certainty.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Most readers don't know what \"low certainty evidence\" means. This leaves them guessing about how much to trust the findings.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence for these medications was of low or very low certainty. This means we have little confidence in the results, and future research could change these conclusions.\"\n\n3.  **Make the key messages more direct and impactful.** The section starts with a weak introductory sentence that dilutes the main findings.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We looked at the evidence on medications like betahistine for Ménière’s disease.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is a statement about the review process, not a key message for the reader. The bullet points that follow are the actual key messages.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Remove this sentence and begin the summary directly with the first bullet point: \"- The benefits and harms of these medications are unclear.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile or median ranges for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is low at 9.5 (P25) and the average sentence length is a concise 15.9 words (P25). While these metrics indicate the writing style is clear and accessible, they do not override the critical content and structural issues identified, such as the missing 'Methods' section and the need to define key research terms for the reader."
