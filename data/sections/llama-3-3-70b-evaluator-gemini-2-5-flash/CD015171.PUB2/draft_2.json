  "draft": "Benefits and Risks of Betahistine, Diuretics, Antivirals, and Corticosteroids for Treating Meniere’s Disease\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know the benefits and risks of medicines like betahistine, diuretics (which increase urine production), antivirals (which fight viruses), and corticosteroids (which reduce inflammation) for treating Meniere’s disease. \n- There is not enough good-quality evidence to determine which of these medicines is most effective for preventing vertigo attacks (a feeling of spinning) and associated symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n- Future research should focus on developing a core outcome set (a standardized set of measurements) to guide future studies and enable the combination of results, including the potential harms of treatment.\n\nWhat is Meniere’s Disease and Why is it a Problem?\nMeniere’s disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. \n\nWhat Did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medicines for people with Meniere’s disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nWhat Did We Find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere’s disease. The studies evaluated the following medicines: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. The evidence for these medicines is very uncertain. There are few randomized controlled trials that compare these medicines to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty.\n\nLimitations of the Evidence\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and lack of coverage across the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency of the Evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It has critical structural and formatting issues that must be addressed before it can be published. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Methods' section.** The summary jumps from the aims to the results, leaving the reader to wonder how the review was done. A methods section is required for transparency.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a new section with the subheading, 'How did we conduct the review?' and include a brief description of the methods, based on the source material (e.g., 'We searched for studies that compared these medicines to a placebo...').\n\n2. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires a question-and-answer format to guide the reader, but two subheadings and the main title are currently statements.\n    *   **Quote:** 'Limitations of the Evidence' and 'Currency of the Evidence'\n    *   **Problem:** These statement-style headings break the conversational flow of the summary.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change them to '**What are the limitations of the evidence?**' and '**How up to date is this evidence?**' The main title should also be a question, for example: 'What are the benefits and risks of...?'\n\n3. **Simplify the final key message.** The current wording is long and uses technical phrasing that may be unclear to a lay audience.\n    *   **Quote:** 'Future research should focus on developing a core outcome set (a standardized set of measurements) to guide future studies and enable the combination of results, including the potential harms of treatment.'\n    *   **Problem:** This 32-word sentence is complex. Phrases like 'core outcome set' and 'enable the combination of results' are jargon.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this for clarity. For example: '**Researchers need to agree on a standard way to measure symptoms in Meniere's disease studies.** This would make it easier to compare results from different studies to better understand the true benefits and harms of treatments.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS statistical patterns. All metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating that sentence length, voice, and vocabulary complexity are generally appropriate. For example, the average words per sentence (20.41) and passive voice count (4) are well within typical limits. However, the metrics do not capture the critical structural and formatting issues identified in the editorial review, such as the missing methods section and non-question subheadings."
