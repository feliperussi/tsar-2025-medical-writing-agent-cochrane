  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and harms of medications such as betahistine (a type of medication) for people with Ménière’s disease (a condition that affects balance and hearing) are unclear, including their potential effects on vertigo (a feeling of spinning), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).",
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the effectiveness of different medications, including betahistine, diuretics (medications that increase urine production), antivirals (medications that fight viruses), and corticosteroids (medications that reduce inflammation), in preventing vertigo attacks and improving symptoms in people with Ménière’s disease.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on identifying the most effective treatments and outcomes that are important to people with Ménière’s disease, such as reducing vertigo episodes, improving hearing, and minimizing unwanted effects, in order to guide treatment decisions and improve the quality of life for those affected."

      "content": "Ménière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. While the exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, various treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids have been used to manage its symptoms."

      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different systemic pharmacological interventions (medications) for people with Ménière's disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere's disease. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. Most studies lasted for around 3 to 12 months. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not clearly reported in the abstract. The studies compared these interventions to either placebo or no treatment, and the evidence for these interventions was of low or very low certainty. The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain. There are few randomised controlled trials that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and lack of coverage across all populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.",
