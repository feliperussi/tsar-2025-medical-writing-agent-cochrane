  "draft": "# Benefits and Risks of Betahistine, Diuretics, Antivirals, and Corticosteroids for Treating Meniere’s Disease\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of systemic pharmacological interventions (medicines used to treat the whole body), such as betahistine, diuretics (medicines that increase urine production), antivirals (medicines that fight viruses), and corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation), for treating Meniere’s disease are unclear, and harmful effects were rarely reported.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine which of these interventions is most effective for preventing vertigo attacks (a feeling of spinning) and associated symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and the evidence that is available is of low or very low certainty.\n- Future research in this area should focus on developing a core outcome set (a standardized set of measurements) to guide future studies and enable the combination of results, including the potential harms of treatment, to provide more accurate estimates of the effects of these interventions.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is Ménière's disease and why is it a problem?\nMénière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. While the exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, various treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids have been used to manage its symptoms.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different systemic pharmacological interventions (medications) for people with Ménière's disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing systemic pharmacological interventions to placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere's disease. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. The studies were conducted over various time points, including 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ± 12 months, and > 12 months. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the study funding sources, population characteristics such as age and gender, or the countries in which the studies took place. The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain. There are few randomised controlled trials that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière’s disease is needed in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and lack of coverage across the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The linguistic analysis supports these observations, showing the text deviates from typical PLS patterns with high scores for sentence length, nominalization, noun count, and overall vocabulary complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics are in the best quartile (e.g., active voice, pronouns), a significant number of features deviate from typical patterns. Specifically, nominalization (P90), nouns (P90), LIX (P90), RIX (P90), SMOG index (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), complex words (P90), and long words (BEYOND_P90) are all higher than typical, suggesting the text is more complex, noun-heavy, and uses longer words and sentences than is ideal for a Plain Language Summary. The words_per_sentence metric (P75) also confirms longer sentence structures."
