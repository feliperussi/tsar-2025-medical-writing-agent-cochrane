  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids for treating Meniere’s disease?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know the benefits and risks of medicines like betahistine, diuretics (which increase urine production), antivirals (which fight viruses), and corticosteroids (which reduce inflammation) for treating Meniere’s disease because the available studies were small and of poor quality. Harmful effects were rarely reported in the studies we found.\n- There is not enough good-quality evidence to determine which of these medicines is most effective for preventing vertigo attacks (a feeling of spinning) and associated symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n- Researchers need to agree on a standard way to measure symptoms in Meniere's disease studies. This would make it easier to compare results from different studies to better understand the true benefits and harms of treatments.\n\nWhat is Meniere’s disease and why is it a problem?\nMeniere’s disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medicines for people with Meniere’s disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared these medicines to a placebo or no treatment in people with Meniere’s disease. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere’s disease. The studies evaluated the following medicines: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. Overall, we found very few good-quality studies. This means the evidence is of low to very low certainty, and we are very unsure about the effects of these medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people. They also did not always report all their results, or look at all the different types of people, treatments, or symptoms that are important.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets all critical requirements. The linguistic metrics are excellent across the board. I have identified three minor areas for improvement to make the summary even more direct and readable for patients.\n\n**1. Use 'we' consistently to refer to the review authors.**\nThe style guide recommends using 'we' to create a more direct connection with the reader. The draft uses it well in most places but slips into a more formal tone in one section.\n- **Original text:** 'The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medicines for people with Meniere’s disease...'\n- **Problem:** This creates an unnecessary distance between the review team and the reader.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medicines for people with Meniere’s disease...'\n\n**2. Simplify the sentence explaining study limitations.**\nThe sentence describing the limitations combines several ideas, which can be slightly hard to follow.\n- **Original text:** 'They also did not always report all their results, or look at all the different types of people, treatments, or symptoms that are important.'\n- **Problem:** This list within a sentence is a bit wordy and less clear than it could be.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies also had other weaknesses. For example, they did not always report all their results or include all the types of people and treatments that are important to understand.'\n\n**3. Break up the long first key message for better readability.**\nThe first key message is a 46-word sentence. While the average sentence length for the draft is excellent (17.6 words), key messages should be especially concise and easy to grasp quickly.\n- **Original text:** 'We do not know the benefits and risks of medicines like betahistine, diuretics (which increase urine production), antivirals (which fight viruses), and corticosteroids (which reduce inflammation) for treating Meniere’s disease because the available studies were small and of poor quality. Harmful effects were rarely reported in the studies we found.'\n- **Problem:** This long sentence combines the main finding, the reason for it, and a secondary point about harms, which can be overwhelming.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'We are very uncertain about the benefits and risks of common medicines for Meniere's disease (including betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids). The evidence is not reliable because it comes from small, poor-quality studies, which also rarely reported on harmful effects.'\n\nThese small changes will enhance an already well-written summary. The draft's high pronoun count (33 instances, in the top 25% of our corpus) shows you are already using this technique effectively, so making it consistent will be a simple fix.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical or best quartile ranges for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. Notably, the draft scores in the best quartile (P25/P75) for low sentence length (17.6 words), low passive voice (4 instances), and high pronoun use (33 instances), indicating a clear and direct style. No metrics show significant deviation, confirming the text is well-structured and generally easy to read."
