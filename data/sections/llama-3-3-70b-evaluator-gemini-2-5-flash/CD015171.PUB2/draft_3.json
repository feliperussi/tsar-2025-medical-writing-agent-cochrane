  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids for treating Meniere’s disease?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know the benefits and risks of medicines like betahistine, diuretics (which increase urine production), antivirals (which fight viruses), and corticosteroids (which reduce inflammation) for treating Meniere’s disease.\n- There is not enough good-quality evidence to determine which of these medicines is most effective for preventing vertigo attacks (a feeling of spinning) and associated symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n- Researchers need to agree on a standard way to measure symptoms in Meniere's disease studies. This would make it easier to compare results from different studies to better understand the true benefits and harms of treatments.\n\nWhat is Meniere’s disease and why is it a problem?\nMeniere’s disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medicines for people with Meniere’s disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. They aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared these medicines to a placebo or no treatment in people with Meniere’s disease. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere’s disease. The studies evaluated the following medicines: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. The evidence for these medicines is very uncertain. There are few randomized controlled trials that compare these medicines to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and lack of coverage across the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

However, it is not approved because a key section—the limitations—is written in technical language that is not suitable for a patient audience. Addressing this and two other minor points will make the summary much clearer.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Translate the 'Limitations' section into plain language.** The current text is copied directly from a technical source and uses research jargon.\n    -   **Problem Text:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, incomplete reporting of relevant data, and lack of coverage across the full range of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest' (PICO) are meaningless to most readers. This sentence fails to explain the evidence gaps in simple terms.\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people. They also did not always report all their results, or look at all the different types of people, treatments, or symptoms that are important.\"\n\n2.  **Make the main finding in the 'Results' section more concise.** The draft repeats the same idea using different words, which can be confusing.\n    -   **Problem Text:** \"The evidence for these medicines is very uncertain. ... the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** Saying the evidence is both \"very uncertain\" and of \"low or very low certainty\" in two consecutive sentences is redundant. Combining them makes the point more forcefully.\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Overall, we found very few good-quality studies. This means the evidence is of low to very low certainty, and we are very unsure about the effects of these medicines.\"\n\n3.  **Incorporate a key detail about side effects into the 'Key Messages'.** The source material notes that harms were rarely reported, which is important information for patients that is missing from the draft.\n    -   **Problem Text:** \"- We do not know the benefits and risks of medicines like betahistine, diuretics...\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** This is accurate but incomplete. Knowing that the studies rarely mentioned side effects is a crucial finding.\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"- We do not know the benefits and risks of medicines... because the available studies were small and of poor quality. Harmful effects were rarely reported in the studies we found.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong performance on readability, sentence length (18.2 words/sentence), and active voice. However, these automated metrics did not detect the use of specific technical jargon (e.g., 'populations, interventions, comparators') in the limitations section, which requires human editorial review to be translated into plain language."
