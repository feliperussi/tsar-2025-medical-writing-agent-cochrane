  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids for treating Meniere’s disease?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are very uncertain about the benefits and risks of common medicines for Meniere's disease (including betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids). The evidence is not reliable because it comes from small, poor-quality studies, which also rarely reported on harmful effects.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine which of these interventions is most effective for preventing vertigo attacks (a feeling of spinning) and associated symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and the evidence that is available is of low or very low certainty.\n- Future research in this area should focus on developing a core outcome set (a standardized set of measurements) to guide future studies and enable the combination of results, including the potential harms of treatment, to provide more accurate estimates of the effects of these interventions.\n\nWhat is Meniere’s disease and why is it a problem?\nMeniere’s disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of different medicines for people with Meniere’s disease, compared to placebo or no treatment. We aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared these medicines to a placebo or no treatment in people with Meniere’s disease. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere’s disease. The studies evaluated the following medicines: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. Overall, we found very few good-quality studies. This means the evidence is of low to very low certainty, and we are very unsure about the effects of these medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included only a small number of people. The studies also had other weaknesses. For example, they did not always report all their results or include all the types of people and treatments that are important to understand.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
