  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. Mental health problems are a big issue worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face special challenges. These countries often lack skilled healthcare workers, have unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health. This creates a large gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions.\n\nKey Messages\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The lack of skilled healthcare workers, unfair resource distribution, and stigma surrounding mental health contribute to a significant research gap in mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nThere are three main ways to prevent mental disorders. Some programs are for everyone, others focus on people at high risk, and a third type helps those with early signs of illness. These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. We also wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. Our goal is to help governments and health organizations make better decisions to improve mental health in these countries.\n\nWhat search strategy did we use? \nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nHow did we synthesize the data? \nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies took place in a wide range of low- and middle-income countries. Most studies included adults, while some focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers and interventions. We analyzed the results at different times after the interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very certain about these results. This is because of weaknesses in how the studies were done and because the results from different studies were very varied.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong start, but the summary needs revisions to improve clarity and reduce redundancy before it's ready for publication. The main issue is the use of complex, abstract language that makes key sections difficult for a lay audience to understand. The draft also repeats the introduction almost word-for-word and is missing a key finding about harms in the 'Key Messages' section. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex and abstract language.** Several phrases are too technical for a general audience. This makes the text feel dense and hard to follow.\n   - **Quote:** \"...have unfair distributions of resources...\" and \"...unfair resource distribution...\"\n   - **Problem:** This is abstract jargon. It's clearer to state the problem more directly.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace with \"...resources are not shared out fairly...\" or \"...don't have a fair share of resources.\"\n   - **Quote:** \"...many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions.\"\n   - **Problem:** The word \"interventions\" is used 10 times. While common in research, it can be vague. Using more descriptive words would be clearer.\n   - **Suggestion:** Vary the wording. Use terms like \"support programs,\" \"treatments,\" or \"helpful strategies\" where appropriate.\n\n2. **Remove the repetitive introduction.** The first paragraph is repeated almost identically under the subheading \"What is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries?\". This forces the reader to process the same information twice.\n   - **Quote:** The entire first paragraph: \"Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems... many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions.\"\n   - **Problem:** This text is immediately repeated after the 'Key Messages', making the summary feel clunky and inefficient.\n   - **Suggestion:** Delete the first paragraph entirely. The summary flows better starting directly with the 'Key Messages', followed by the detailed background in the first question-based section.\n\n3. **Add the missing finding about harms to the Key Messages.** The summary should always the readers about potential harms or the lack thereof. This information was included in the source material but omitted from the draft.\n   - **Quote:** \"- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Problem:** This message is incomplete. The source material adds the important finding that \"no significant harmful effects were reported.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add this finding to the bullet point. For example: \"...although the quality of evidence for the benefits is not strong enough to be certain. We found no reports of significant harmful effects from these programs.\"\n",
