  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. Mental health problems are a big issue worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face special challenges. These countries often lack skilled healthcare workers, have unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health. This creates a large gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions.\n\nKey Messages\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n- The benefits of these interventions include improving mental health outcomes and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions and explore ways to reduce bias.\n\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries?\nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The scarcity of skilled human resources, unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health all contribute to a significant research gap in the field of mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders?\nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. We also wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. Our goal is to help governments and health organizations make better decisions to improve mental health in these countries.\n\nMethods\nWhat search strategy did we use?\nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nHow did we synthesize the data?\nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, and both. The interventions were categorized as universal prevention/promotion, selective prevention, and indicated prevention, with 22, 36, and 55 studies, respectively. We analyzed the results at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months after the interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very certain about these results. This is because of weaknesses in how the studies were done and because the results from different studies were very varied.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions for factual completeness and clarity before it can be approved. There are critical omissions in the 'Key Messages' section that misrepresent the review's findings. Additionally, the text uses overly complex and academic language that will be difficult for a lay audience to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Restore Missing Information in 'Key Messages'**: The current key messages omit crucial context from the source material. This is a factual accuracy issue.\n   - **Problematic Text**: The first and third bullet points are incomplete.\n   - **Why it's a problem**: The first bullet point omits the important caveat that the evidence is not strong. The third bullet point omits the key recommendation to study cost-effectiveness.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite**: Please revise the key messages to match the source material more closely:\n     - First bullet: \"Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, **although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.**\"\n     - Third bullet: \"Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, **and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.**\"\n\n2. **Simplify Complex and Abstract Language**: The summary uses academic vocabulary that makes it less accessible. This is reflected in the evaluation metrics, which show a high number of complex and long words.\n   - **Problematic Text**: \"The scarcity of skilled human resources, unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health all contribute to a significant research gap in the field of mental health promotion and prevention.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem**: Words like 'scarcity', 'human resources', 'distributions', 'contribute', and 'significant research gap' are jargon. This style is repeated throughout the draft.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite**: \"These countries often don't have enough trained health workers, resources are not shared fairly, and people may feel ashamed to seek help for mental health. Because of this, we don't have enough research on how to best support people's well-being.\"\n\n3. **Break Up Long, Complicated Sentences**: Several sentences are too long and contain multiple ideas, making them hard to follow.\n   - **Problematic Text**: \"Interventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem**: This 36-word sentence introduces three new technical terms and their definitions all at once, which can overwhelm the reader.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite**: \"There are three main ways to prevent mental disorders. **Universal prevention** is for everyone. **Selective prevention** is for groups of people at high risk. **Indicated prevention** is for people who show early signs of a mental illness.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While some metrics like active voice and sentence length are within the median range, there are significant deviations that impact readability. Five key metrics fall into the 'BEYOND_P90' category, indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. These include the SMOG index (grade level 15.4) and high counts of complex, long, and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. The text is also unusually noun-heavy ('nouns' BEYOND_P90) and uses many noun-form verbs ('nominalization' P90), which supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and use more direct, active verbs."
