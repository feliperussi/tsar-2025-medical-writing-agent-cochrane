  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKey Messages\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries. They might reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.\n- The benefits of these interventions include improving mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of having primary healthcare workers take on some mental health tasks, explore ways to reduce the risk of bias in these studies, and examine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions to inform decision-making and policy development in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries?\nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges in addressing this issue. They lack skilled health workers, have unfair resource distribution, and stigma around mental health. These issues create a big gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders?\nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. They wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. The authors also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and to identify areas for future research, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and practice decisions that can improve mental health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nMethods\nWhat search strategy did we use?\nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nHow did we synthesize the data?\nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, and both. The interventions were categorized as universal prevention/promotion, selective prevention, and indicated prevention, with 22, 36, and 55 studies, respectively. We analyzed the results at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months after the interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it needs significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too academic and relies on technical jargon and complex sentence structures that will be difficult for patients and the public to understand. The main issues are the use of unexplained research terms, abstract noun-heavy phrases, and overly long sentences.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Explain or replace technical jargon.** Readers are unlikely to understand terms like 'heterogeneity' or 'blinded'. You should explain these concepts in simple terms or remove them.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Risk of bias' and 'heterogeneity' are undefined technical terms that stop reader comprehension.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, we are not very certain about these results. This is because of weaknesses in how the studies were done and because the results from different studies were very varied.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify long, complex sentences.** Several sentences are over 30 words long and contain multiple complex ideas, making them hard to follow.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"The authors also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and to identify areas for future research, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and practice decisions that can improve mental health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 39-word sentence is dense with abstract concepts like 'evaluate the certainty' and 'informing policy decisions'.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also wanted to see how certain the evidence was and find gaps for future research. Our goal is to help governments and health organizations make better decisions to improve mental health in these countries.\"\n\n3.  **Use simple, everyday words instead of abstract or formal language.** The text often uses formal phrasing where simpler words would be clearer.\n    *   **Problematic phrase:** \"...large inequities in resource distribution and utilization, and stigma...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is abstract and noun-heavy. It's hard for a reader to visualize.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...resources are not shared fairly, and people often feel ashamed to talk about mental health.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much more accessible and useful for its intended audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While 33% of metrics fall within the best quartile, a significant portion (39%) are in the P90 range or beyond, indicating deviation from plain language standards. The key issues are related to vocabulary complexity. Metrics for complex words (smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, long_words), noun density (nouns), and use of abstract nouns (nominalization) are all significantly higher than is typical for a PLS, confirming that the text's vocabulary and sentence structure are too complex for a lay audience."
