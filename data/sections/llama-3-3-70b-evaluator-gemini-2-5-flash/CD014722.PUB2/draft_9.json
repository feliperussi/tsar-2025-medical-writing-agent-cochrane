  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. \nKey messages: \n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, we are not confident in this evidence because of flaws in the studies we found.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide. People in these countries often face unique challenges. There may not be enough trained health workers, resources are not always shared fairly, and there can be stigma around mental health.\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if programs run by local health workers could help prevent mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries. We examined the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs. We also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and identify areas for future research.\nWhat search strategy did we use? \nWe searched major medical databases for studies that looked at mental health programs run by local health workers in low- and middle-income countries.\nHow did we synthesize the data? \nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. Most studies included adults, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers and interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very confident in these results because many of the studies had flaws in their methods and the results from different studies varied a lot.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets most plain language guidelines. However, it is not approved because a few key sections could be clearer for a patient audience. Addressing the following 3 points will significantly improve readability.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Make the Key Message More Specific:** The reason for low confidence is too vague.\n- **Original sentence:** \"However, we are not confident in this evidence because of flaws in the studies we found.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The word \"flaws\" doesn't explain the actual issues. Readers are left wondering what was wrong with the studies.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, we have low confidence in these results. This is because of weaknesses in how the studies were designed and because their findings often varied.\"\n\n**2. Avoid Technical Jargon in the Introduction:** The section on prevention types introduces complex terms that are not essential for understanding the summary.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Interventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness).\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Introducing jargon like \"universal,\" \"selective,\" and \"indicated prevention,\" even with definitions, adds a layer of technicality that can be intimidating and hard to remember.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Prevention programs can be designed for different groups. Some are for everyone in a community, others are for people at a higher risk of mental health problems, and some are for individuals who are showing early signs of an illness.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the Methods Description:** The methods sections are too brief and don't fully explain what the review did.\n- **Original text:** \"What search strategy did we use? We searched major medical databases for studies that looked at mental health programs run by local health workers in low- and middle-income countries. How did we synthesize the data? We summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is a missed opportunity to explain the review's core comparison in simple terms.\n- **Suggested rewrite (combining the two sections):** \"**What did we do in this review?** We searched for studies that compared mental health programs run by local health workers against usual care or no program. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to see if the programs were effective and to assess our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\nBy making these changes, the summary will be even more accessible and useful for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Sentence length is good (16.23 words) and active voice is used well. However, the analysis identified a high number of complex words according to the Dale-Chall list (215, placing it in the 90th percentile), which supports the editorial feedback to replace some technical vocabulary with more common, everyday terms."
