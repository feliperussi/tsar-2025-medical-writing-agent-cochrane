  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. Mental health problems are a big issue worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face special challenges. These countries often lack skilled healthcare workers, have unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health. This creates a large gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions.\n\nKey Messages\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The lack of skilled healthcare workers, unfair resource distribution, and stigma surrounding mental health contribute to a significant research gap in mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. We also wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. Our goal is to help governments and health organizations make better decisions to improve mental health in these countries.\n\nMethods \nWhat search strategy did we use? \nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries. \nHow did we synthesize the data? \nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults \nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, and both. The interventions were categorized as universal prevention/promotion, selective prevention, and indicated prevention, with 22, 36, and 55 studies, respectively. We analyzed the results at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months after the interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very certain about these results. This is because of weaknesses in how the studies were done and because the results from different studies were very varied.\n\nLimitations \nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nCurrency \nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It requires revisions to meet Cochrane style guidelines and improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of non-question headings and overly complex, academic language.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Remove Redundant, Non-Question Headings:** The headings 'Methods', 'Results', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' violate the style guide, which requires question-based subheadings.\n- **Problem:** These extra headings make the structure confusing and are not in the required format.\n- **Suggestion:** Delete these four headings and rely only on the existing question-based subheadings (e.g., 'What did we find?').\n\n**2. Simplify Technical Concepts and Jargon:** The text uses research terms that will be unfamiliar to most readers.\n- **Quote:** 'Interventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness).'\n- **Problem:** These terms are jargon. Even with brief definitions, readers are the distinction when these terms are used later in the results.\n- **Suggestion:** Describe the concepts in plain language instead of naming them. For example: 'There are three main ways to prevent mental disorders. Some programs are for everyone, others focus on people at high risk, and a third type helps those with early signs of illness.'\n\n**3. Rephrase Noun-Heavy, Abstract Sentences:** Several sentences are dense with abstract nouns, making them hard to understand.\n- **Quote:** 'The lack of skilled healthcare workers, unfair resource distribution, and stigma surrounding mental health contribute to a significant research gap in mental health promotion and prevention.'\n- **Problem:** This sentence is passive and academic. Using more direct verbs would make it clearer and more engaging.\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite to be more active and concrete. For example: 'These countries often don't have enough skilled healthcare workers, resources are not shared fairly, and people may feel ashamed to discuss mental health. This means not enough research has been done on how to support well-being and prevent mental disorders.'\n\n**4. Summarize Detailed Statistics in the Results:** The results section presents a list of numbers that is overwhelming for a lay reader.\n- **Quote:** '...with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings.'\n- **Problem:** This level of detail about country income categories is unnecessary and distracts from the main findings.\n- **Suggestion:** Provide a simple summary. For example: 'The studies took place in a wide range of low- and middle-income countries.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour own editorial instincts are confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft's vocabulary is significantly more complex than a typical PLS, with metrics for complex words (`smog_index`, `complex_words`), long words, and unfamiliar words (`complex_words_dc`) all falling 'Beyond the 90th percentile'. The high number of nouns and nominalizations also supports the need to rewrite sentences using more active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length (19.3 words/sentence) and active voice use are strong, the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for complex words (SMOG, complex_words, complex_words_dc, long_words) are all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the language is much more technical than a typical PLS. The high number of nouns and nominalizations also suggests the writing style is too academic and not direct enough for a lay audience."
