  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. Mental health problems are a big issue worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face special challenges. These countries often lack skilled healthcare workers, have resources that are not shared out fairly, and stigma surrounding mental health. This creates a large gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to support programs, treatments, or helpful strategies for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nKey Messages\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The lack of skilled healthcare workers, resources that are not shared out fairly, and stigma surrounding mental health all contribute to a significant research gap in the field of mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. They wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. The authors also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and to identify areas for future research, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and practice decisions that can improve mental health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nWhat search strategy did we use? \nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nHow did we synthesize the data? \nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, and both. The interventions were categorized as universal prevention/promotion, selective prevention, and indicated prevention, with 22, 36, and 55 studies, respectively. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the review because it has significant clarity and readability issues that would make it difficult for a lay audience to understand. While all sections are present and factually accurate, the language is too academic and dense. Specifically, the draft uses many long, complex words and noun-heavy sentences, repeats background information, and explains the main findings using unexplained jargon.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.** Many sentences are long and use abstract nouns instead of simple verbs, making them hard to follow.\n   - **Example:** 'The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries.'\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using simpler language and active verbs. For example: 'We wanted to find out if programs run by local health workers could help prevent mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries.'\n\n2. **Remove redundant information.** The background information explaining the challenges in low- and middle-income countries is repeated almost word-for-word in the introduction and in the first section.\n   - **Example:** The paragraph starting 'Mental health problems are a big issue worldwide...' in the introduction is nearly identical to the paragraph under the 'What is the problem...' subheading.\n   - **Suggestion:** State the problem once clearly under the appropriate subheading and keep the main introduction very brief.\n\n3. **Explain technical terms in the findings.** The summary of the results uses jargon that will be unfamiliar to most readers, which hides the main message.\n   - **Example:** 'However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity.'\n   - **Suggestion:** Explain these terms in simple language. For example: 'However, we are not very confident in these results. This is because many of the studies had flaws in their methods (risk of bias), and the results from different studies varied a lot.'\n\nThese issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the text has a very high number of complex and long words, making it difficult to read (SMOG Index: 15.6, Dale-Chall Readability: 8.5).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with only 38.9% of features falling in the best quartile. The main issue is significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Seven key metrics fall outside the typical range for a PLS. Specifically, the counts for nouns, complex words (both general and Dale-Chall), and long words are exceptionally high (all 'Beyond P90'). This contributes to high (poor) readability scores like the SMOG index (15.6) and Dale-Chall score (8.5), indicating the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS. The high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) also points to an overly academic writing style."
