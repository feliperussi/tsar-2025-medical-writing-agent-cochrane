  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. \nKey messages: \n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, we have low confidence in these results because of weaknesses in how the studies were designed and because their findings often varied.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide. People in these countries often face unique challenges, such as a lack of trained health workers, unfair distribution of resources, and stigma around mental health.\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nPrevention programs can be designed for different groups. Some are for everyone in a community, others are for people at a higher risk of mental health problems, and some are for individuals who are showing early signs of an illness. These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if programs run by local health workers could help prevent mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries. We examined the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs. We also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and identify areas for future research.\nWhat did we do in this review? \nWe searched for studies that compared mental health programs run by local health workers against usual care or no program. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to see if the programs were effective and to assess our confidence in the evidence.\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. Most studies included adults, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers and interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very confident in these results because many of the studies had weaknesses in their methods and the results from different studies varied a lot.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. The readability scores are excellent. To make the summary even more accessible to a lay audience, I recommend focusing on clarifying a few key phrases. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Clarify 'weaknesses' in study design.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...because of weaknesses in how the studies were designed...\" (from Key Messages) and \"...because many of the studies had weaknesses in their methods...\" (from 'What did we find?').\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is abstract for a non-researcher. Explaining *what* the weaknesses were makes the reason for low confidence much clearer.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace the phrase with a more concrete explanation. For example: \"This is because of concerns about how the studies were conducted (for example, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting), and because the results from different studies varied.\"\n\n2. **Replace research jargon with simpler terms.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...and to assess our confidence in the evidence.\" (from 'What did we do in this review?').\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term 'confidence in the evidence' is technical jargon. A reader might not understand that this refers to the quality and consistency of the research findings.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to describe the action in simpler terms. For example: \"...and checked the quality of the research to see how reliable the findings are.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the opening key message.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines a main finding with specific examples, making it a bit long and dense for a key message. Breaking it into two shorter sentences can improve readability.\n   - **Suggestion:** Split the sentence to improve clarity. For example: \"Programs run by primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries. For example, these programs may reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 72% of metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and clarity, including excellent scores for sentence length (17 words/sentence) and reading grade level (9.87). All metrics are within the typical range, indicating a very strong foundation. The suggested edits focus on refining specific word choices to further enhance clarity for a lay audience, rather than addressing any systemic issues."
