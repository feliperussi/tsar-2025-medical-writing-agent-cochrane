  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. \n\nKey messages:\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges, including a lack of skilled healthcare workers, unfair distribution of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health. This creates a large gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to support programs, treatments, or helpful strategies for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if programs run by local health workers could help prevent mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries. We examined the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs. We also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and identify areas for future research.\n\nWhat search strategy did we use? \nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nHow did we synthesize the data? \nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. Most studies included adults, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers and interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very confident in these results because many of the studies had flaws in their methods and the results from different studies varied a lot.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start, but it is not approved because of a critical factual omission in the key messages and several areas where clarity can be significantly improved for a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Restore Missing Information in Key Messages:** The first key message omits the authors' uncertainty about the evidence, which is a crucial part of the findings.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This gives readers a more positive impression than the evidence supports. The source text explicitly states, \"the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, we are not confident in this evidence because of flaws in the studies we found.\"\n\n2. **Make the Methods Sections More Informative:** The methods sections are too brief and don't explain the process in a way that builds reader trust.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"What search strategy did we use? We searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This just repeats the topic of the review. It doesn't explain *how* you searched in simple terms.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched major medical databases for studies that looked at mental health programs run by local health workers in low- and middle-income countries.\"\n\n3. **Simplify Complex and Noun-Heavy Language:** Several sentences use unnecessarily formal words and structure, which can make them difficult to understand.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges, including a lack of skilled healthcare workers, unfair distribution of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is dense and uses abstract nouns like \"distribution.\" This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of nouns, long words, and complex words compared to typical summaries.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"People in these countries often face unique challenges. There may not be enough trained health workers, resources are not always shared fairly, and there can be stigma around mental health.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 77% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis identified three features deviating from the norm (in the 90th percentile range): a high count of nouns (169), Dale-Chall complex words (235), and long words (174). This suggests that while sentence structure is good, the vocabulary could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
