  "draft": "# Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n**Key Messages**\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.\n- The benefits of these interventions seem to \n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of task-shifting mental health interventions to primary healthcare workers, explore ways to reduce the risk of bias in these studies, and examine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions to inform decision-making and policy development in low- and middle-income countries.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries?\nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The scarcity of skilled human resources, large inequities in resource distribution and utilization, and stigma surrounding and mental health all contribute to a significant research gap in the field of mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in LMICs lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n### What are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders?\nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in LMICs is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in LMICs. They wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. The authors also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and to identify areas for future research, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and practice decisions that can improve mental health outcomes in LMICs.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\n### Data Synthesis\nWe summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, and both. The interventions were categorized as universal prevention/promotion, selective prevention, and indicated prevention, with 22, 36, and 55 studies, respectively. The duration of the studies was not explicitly stated, but the analysis was conducted at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months post-intervention. The funding sources for the studies were not specified. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not consistently reported across the studies. However, the studies did provide an overview of the severity of the condition, with some studies focusing on specific mental health outcomes, such as anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and distress/PTSD symptoms. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues in subheading formatting and an incomplete key message. Additionally, there are significant clarity and style problems, including overly long and complex sentences, noun-heavy phrasing, and unexplained jargon, which make the text difficult for a patient audience to understand. These issues are supported by linguistic metrics indicating high complexity and deviation from typical Plain Language Summary patterns.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement of the Master Style Guide. For example, 'Search Strategy', 'Data Synthesis', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' should be rephrased as questions.\n2.  **Factual Incompleteness:** The second key message, 'The benefits of these interventions seem to', is incomplete and needs to be addressed by either completing the sentence with the intended information or removing the bullet point if no content is available.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Overly Long and Complex Sentences:**\n    *   **Quote:** 'Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.' (Key Message 1)\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is excessively long (46 words) and contains multiple clauses, making it challenging for a patient audience to process and understand in one go.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries. They might reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.'\n\n2.  **Noun-Heavy and Complex Vocabulary:**\n    *   **Quote:** 'The scarcity of skilled human resources, large inequities in resource distribution and utilization, and stigma surrounding and mental health all contribute to a significant research gap in the field of mental health promotion and prevention.' (Introduction)\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is dense with abstract nouns and complex terms ('scarcity', 'inequities', 'distribution', 'utilization', 'promotion', 'prevention'), making it sound academic and less accessible. The phrase 'stigma surrounding and mental health' is also awkward.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Low- and middle-income countries face challenges like a lack of skilled health workers, unfair distribution of resources, and stigma around mental health. These issues create a big gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders.'\n\n3.  **Unexplained Jargon:**\n    *   **Quote:** 'Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of task-shifting mental health interventions to primary healthcare workers...' (Key Message 3) and '...substantial levels of heterogeneity.' (Results section)\n    *   **Why problematic:** Technical terms like 'task-shifting' and 'heterogeneity' are used without explanation, which will confuse a general audience.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** For 'task-shifting': 'Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of having primary healthcare workers take on some mental health tasks...' For 'heterogeneity': '...and differences in how the studies were done.'\n\n4.  **Passive Voice:**\n    *   **Quote:** 'The duration of the studies was not explicitly stated, but the analysis was conducted at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months post-intervention.' (Results section)\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence uses passive voice ('was not explicitly stated', 'was conducted'), which obscures the actor and makes the text less direct, contrary to the Master Style Guide.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies did not explicitly state their duration, but we analyzed the results at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months after the interventions.'",
