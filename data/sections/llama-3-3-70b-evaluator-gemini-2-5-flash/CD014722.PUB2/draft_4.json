  "draft": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. Mental health problems are a big issue worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face special challenges. These countries often lack skilled healthcare workers, have unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health. This creates a large gap in research on how to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions.\n\nKey Messages\n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The benefits of these interventions seem to improve mental health outcomes and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries?\nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The lack of skilled healthcare workers, unfair resource distribution, and stigma surrounding mental health contribute to a significant research gap in mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in these countries lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders?\nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries is not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the best approaches for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in these settings.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of primary-level worker interventions for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. We also wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs, and to identify the most effective strategies for delivering these interventions. Our goal is to help governments and health organizations make better decisions to improve mental health in these countries.\n\nMethods\nWhat search strategy did we use?\nWe searched for studies on primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and disorder prevention in low- and middle-income countries.\nHow did we synthesize the data?\nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, and both. The interventions were categorized as universal prevention/promotion, selective prevention, and indicated prevention, with 22, 36, and 55 studies, respectively. We analyzed the results at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months after the interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very certain about these results. This is because of weaknesses in how the studies were done and because the results from different studies were very varied.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy. However, it needs significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The language is too complex and formal, which makes it difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex and abstract language throughout the summary.** The text uses many long, formal words and abstract nouns where simpler, everyday language would be clearer. This is the most critical issue.\n    *   **Example:** 'These countries often lack skilled healthcare workers, have unfair distributions of resources, and stigma surrounding mental health.'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Distributions of resources' is an abstract, noun-heavy phrase.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'In these countries, resources are often not shared fairly, and there is a stigma around mental health.'\n\n2. **Remove repetitive information.** The main introductory paragraph and the first section ('What is the problem...') say almost the same thing. This makes the summary feel longer and less focused.\n    *   **Example:** The first paragraph and the first section both explain the challenges in LMICs (lack of skilled workers, resource issues, stigma).\n    *   **Problem:** Repeating the same background information confuses the reader and wastes space.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Keep the main points in the introduction brief and use the first section to provide slightly more detail, ensuring they don't use the exact same phrasing.\n\n3. **Make the 'Key Messages' clearer and more concise.** The second key message is vague and repeats the first one.\n    *   **Example:** 'The benefits of these interventions seem to improve mental health outcomes and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is circular – it says the 'benefits' are 'improvements'. It doesn't add new information for the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Remove this bullet point. Consider combining the most important findings into a single, stronger key message, such as: 'Giving primary healthcare workers the task of preventing mental health problems may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults and improve quality of life in children. However, we are not certain about these results because of weaknesses in the studies.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a moderate overall conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and use of active voice are appropriate (P50-P75 range), the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics fall into the 'BEYOND_P90' category: `nouns` (241.0), `smog_index` (15.5), `complex_words_dc` (338.0), `complex_words` (164.0), and `long_words` (256.0). This indicates the text uses far more nouns, polysyllabic words, and generally complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, making it difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
