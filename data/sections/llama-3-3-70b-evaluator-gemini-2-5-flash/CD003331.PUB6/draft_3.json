  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? \n\nKey messages: \n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program that includes exercise, education, and counseling for people with heart conditions. For adults with heart failure, it likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their health-related quality of life. However, there is no clear evidence that it affects mortality rates.\n- Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure, and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and to address the limitations of current evidence.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? \nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. Heart failure can be divided into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? \nCommon treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to find out whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and improving health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure. They also wanted to know whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n\nHow did we do the review? \nWe searched for studies comparing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise control, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess its effects on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. Most of the studies looked at people with a specific type of heart failure (HFrEF). These patients often had moderate symptoms and did their exercise programs at a hospital or clinic. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) undertaking exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in a home-based setting. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review? \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the frequent use of abstract nouns (nominalizations), complex vocabulary, and passive voice, which make the text dense and hard to follow. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in these areas (`passive_voice`, `nominalization`, `complex_words`). Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Use more active verbs instead of abstract nouns.** The text often turns actions into nouns (e.g., 'hospital admissions' instead of 'being admitted to the hospital'), which makes it feel academic. The analysis shows nominalization and noun counts are much higher than is typical for a PLS.\n   - **Example:** \"The review authors wanted to find out whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and improving health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a list of abstract concepts. It's hard for readers to visualize.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We wanted to find out if these exercise programs help adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex words and phrases.** Several readability scores (like the SMOG index) are high because of multi-syllable words. Replacing jargon with everyday language will make the summary more accessible.\n   - **Example:** \"Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups... to address the limitations of current evidence.\"\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like \"underrepresented groups\" and \"address the limitations of current evidence\" are jargony.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"In the future, studies should include more people from groups that haven't been well-studied. This will help fix gaps in the current evidence.\"\n\n3. **Change passive sentences to active voice.** The draft has 26 passive constructions, which is significantly more than a typical PLS. Passive voice can make it unclear who is performing an action.\n   - **Example:** \"The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment...\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"their assigned treatment\" is indirect and a bit clinical.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"The evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length is good (19.8 words, in the best 25% of PLS), there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure. Seven key metrics are in the highest 10% for complexity, including passive voice, nominalizations (abstract nouns), total nouns, and several measures of complex/long words (SMOG index, complex_words, long_words). This suggests the text is dense and may be difficult for readers, despite having short sentences."
