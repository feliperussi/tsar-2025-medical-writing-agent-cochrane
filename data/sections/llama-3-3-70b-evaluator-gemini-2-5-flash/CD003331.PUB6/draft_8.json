  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? We looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out.\nKey messages \n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely means people are admitted to the hospital less often and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure, but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality rates.\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may help people regardless of the type of heart failure, and people can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. There are two types of heart failure: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood out well, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart muscle is too stiff to fill with blood properly.\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Another treatment is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. This is a program of exercise and education that helps people manage their heart failure and improve their quality of life.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. We also wanted to know if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether people can do the program in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\nHow did we do the review? We searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life.\nWhat did we find? We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. People can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center, and it may help people regardless of the type of heart failure.\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? We have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Second, many studies were small and did not include a diverse range of people or treatments.\nHow up to date is this review? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, it is not approved because a few key improvements are needed to make it clearer and more direct for a patient audience. My top 3 recommendations focus on simplifying clinical language, being more specific about the evidence limitations, and making the text easier to read by defining and shortening the main technical term.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Simpler, More Active Language**\n\nYour sentences are sometimes weighed down by clinical-sounding nouns and noun phrases (nominalizations). Using more direct verbs will make the key messages easier to grasp quickly.\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"...there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality rates.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"a difference in mortality rates\" is indirect and uses clinical jargon. It's clearer to state what the research found directly.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...it does not seem to affect the risk of dying.\"\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects\" is a bit wordy and abstract.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We then compared the results and used them to rate our certainty about the evidence.\"\n\n**2. Be More Specific About the Limitations of the Evidence**\n\nThe current description of limitations is too general. Providing specific details about who was missing from the studies helps readers understand why the evidence might not apply to them.\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"Second, many studies were small and did not include a diverse range of people or treatments.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is vague. Readers will wonder *which* people were missing. The original abstract specifies these groups.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Second, many studies were small and did not include enough older people, women, or people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure (HFpEF). This makes it harder to know if the results apply to everyone.\"\n\n**3. Define and Shorten the Main Technical Term**\n\nThe term \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation\" is long and repeated many times. This makes the text feel repetitive and more complex than it needs to be.\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** The term \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation\" is used 7 times.\n- **Why it's a problem:** Repeatedly using a long, multi-word technical term makes the text harder to read. It's better to define it once and then use a simple shorthand.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** In the section \"What are the common treatments for heart failure?\", introduce the term with a simple definition and a shorthand. For example: \"Another treatment is **exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation**, a program of exercise and education to help people manage their condition. We will call this 'the exercise program' in this summary.\" Then, use \"the exercise program\" in the rest of the text.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis identified significant deviations in two areas: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) and the overall noun count are both in the 90th percentile. This supports the editorial feedback that the text could be made clearer by replacing noun-heavy phrases with more direct, active verbs."
