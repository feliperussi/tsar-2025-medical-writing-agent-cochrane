  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? We looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out.\n\nKey messages\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure, but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality rates.\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may help people regardless of the type of heart failure, and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. There are two types of heart failure: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Another treatment is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. This is a program of exercise and education that helps people manage their heart failure and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. We also wanted to know if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n\nHow did we do the review? We searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we find? We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. People can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center, and it may help people regardless of the type of heart failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? We have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Second, many studies were small and did not include a diverse range of people or treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this review? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

I have three suggestions to make the key messages even clearer for patients by using more direct language, which is an area the linguistic analysis also flagged for improvement.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\nSome sentences are built around abstract nouns, which can be harder to understand than direct actions.\n- **Quote:** \"...likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions...\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** The phrase \"risk of admissions\" is an abstract concept. It's clearer to state directly what happens to people.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...likely means people are admitted to the hospital less often...\"\n\n**2. Simplify the definitions for the types of heart failure.**\nThe current definitions are medically correct but could be more intuitive for a lay audience.\n- **Quote:** \"...heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** The terms \"contract\" and \"relax\" are still a bit clinical. Linking them directly to the heart's pumping job can make the concepts clearer.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood out well, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart muscle is too stiff to fill with blood properly.\"\n\n**3. Convert passive voice to active voice for clarity.**\nUsing the active voice makes it clearer who is performing the action.\n- **Quote:** \"...whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** The passive phrase \"can be delivered\" is less direct. Phrasing it from the patient's perspective is more engaging.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and whether people can do the program in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\"\n\nThese changes will help address the high number of nouns and nominalizations found in the analysis and make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 88.9% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in two areas: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'nouns' (P90). This suggests the text relies heavily on noun-based phrases rather than direct verbs, which can make it less clear for a lay audience."
