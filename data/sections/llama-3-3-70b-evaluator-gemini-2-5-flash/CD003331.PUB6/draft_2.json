  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure?\nKey messages:\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is a program that includes exercise, education, and counseling for people with heart conditions. For adults with heart failure (when the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), ExCR likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their health-related quality of life (their ability to perform daily activities and enjoy life). However, there is no clear evidence that ExCR affects mortality (death) rates.\n- Participation in ExCR may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)), and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of ExCR and to address the limitations of current evidence, including the need for longer-term follow-up and more diverse study populations.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. Heart failure can be divided into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure?\nCommon treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether ExCR is effective in reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and improving health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure. They also wanted to know whether ExCR is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise control, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess its effects on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted over a median follow-up period of six months. Most of the existing evidence base includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), primarily those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) programmes. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) undertaking ExCR in a home-based setting. The studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual care (no exercise) and other active treatments like education, psychological support, or medical management. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), the studies were very small (imprecise estimates), and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, and all the necessary information is here. However, the summary needs significant editing to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. Several sentences are long, complex, and use a passive, academic tone that will be difficult for patients to follow. My top 3 recommendations focus on simplifying these complex sentences and replacing jargon with everyday language.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify the technical description in the 'What did we find?' section.**\nThe current wording is lifted directly from the abstract and is too dense for a plain language summary.\n- **Original Text:** \"Most of the existing evidence base includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), primarily those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) programmes.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 38-word sentence is packed with undefined jargon (NYHA classes) and complex phrasing (\"existing evidence base\"). It creates a significant barrier to understanding the key findings.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Most of the studies we found looked at people with a specific type of heart failure (HFrEF). These patients often had moderate symptoms and did their exercise programs at a hospital or clinic.\"\n\n**2. Shorten the long, complex sentence in the 'Key messages'.**\nThis sentence contains important information about future research, but its length and structure make it hard to process.\n- **Original Text:** \"Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of ExCR and to address the limitations of current evidence, including the need for longer-term follow-up and more diverse study populations.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** At 49 words, this sentence is far too long. It combines multiple ideas (who to recruit, why, and what is needed) into one complex structure.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To improve the evidence, future studies should include more older adults, women, and people with the HFpEF type of heart failure. Researchers also need to follow people for longer to understand the long-term effects.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the abstract language in the 'Limitations' section.**\nThe current explanation of limitations uses technical research terms that are not meaningful to a general reader.\n- **Original Text:** \"...the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'interventions', 'comparators', and 'outcomes of interest' are research jargon. Readers won't understand what specific gaps in the evidence this refers to.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...the studies did not include all types of people with heart failure or compare all the different ways exercise programs could be run.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your own evaluation results support these edits. The draft has very high scores for `passive_voice` (28), `nominalization` (40), `complex_words` (152), and `long_words` (228), all of which are well beyond the typical range for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing the sentences above will help bring these metrics, and the overall readability, into a much better range.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity with typical patterns. While some metrics for sentence structure and readability fall within the median range (P50), there is a significant deviation in vocabulary and style. Six key features are rated 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. These include an extremely high number of passive voice constructions (28), nominalizations (40), complex words (152), and long words (228). These deviations are the primary cause of the text's academic tone and reduced clarity for a lay audience."
