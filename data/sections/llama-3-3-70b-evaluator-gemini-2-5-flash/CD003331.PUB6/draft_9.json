  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? We looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out. \nKey messages \n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely means people are admitted to the hospital less often and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure, but it does not seem to affect the risk of dying.\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may help people regardless of the type of heart failure, and people can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. There are two types of heart failure: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood out well, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart muscle is too stiff to fill with blood properly.\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Another treatment is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, a program of exercise and education that helps people manage their heart failure and improve their quality of life. We will call this 'the exercise program' in this summary.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if the exercise program helps adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. We also wanted to know if the exercise program is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether people can do the program in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\nHow did we do the review? We searched for studies that compared the exercise program to no exercise. We then compared the results and used them to rate our certainty about the evidence.\nWhat did we find? We found that the exercise program probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. People can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center, and it may help people regardless of the type of heart failure.\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? We have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Second, many studies were small and did not include enough older people, women, or people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure (HFpEF). This makes it harder to know if the results apply to everyone.\nHow up to date is this review? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, concise, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few key improvements are needed to ensure patients can fully understand the findings and limitations. I'm flagging this as 'NOT_APPROVED' to highlight these important clarity issues, but they should be straightforward to fix.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the terminology for the intervention consistent.** You introduce a simplified term but don't use it, which can be confusing.\n   - **Problematic Text:** In the introduction, you state, \"We will call this 'the exercise program' in this summary.\" But then the Key Messages and Results sections revert to using the longer phrase \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** After defining the intervention, use your simplified term \"the exercise program\" consistently throughout the rest of the summary. For example, change the first key message to: \"- 'The exercise program' likely means people are admitted to the hospital less often...\"\n\n2. **Explain *why* the limitation matters.** The summary states a limitation without explaining its impact on the results, which a lay reader may not understand.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"First, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Explain the concept of blinding more clearly. For example: \"First, people in the studies knew if they were in the exercise group or not. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, which may affect the reliability of those results.\"\n\n3. **Ensure key findings are described consistently.** The summary uses slightly different language to describe the effect on mortality, which could create uncertainty for the reader.\n   - **Problematic Text:** The Key Messages state the program \"does not seem to affect the risk of dying,\" which sounds quite certain. The Results section says, \"it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality,\" which better reflects the low-certainty evidence.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Use the more precise, cautious phrasing in both places. Change the key message to: \"- ...but there is no clear evidence that it affects the risk of dying.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 78% of features fall into the best quartile for readability and plain language, including excellent scores for sentence length (18.7 words), grade level (9.18), and active voice (61 instances). The only metric deviating from typical patterns is the noun count, which is higher than usual (182 instances, placing it in the 90th percentile). This suggests that some sentences could be simplified by using more verbs and fewer complex noun phrases, which aligns with the editorial feedback to simplify terminology."
