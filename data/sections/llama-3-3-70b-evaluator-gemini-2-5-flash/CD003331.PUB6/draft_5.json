  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? We looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out. The studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. We also found that participating in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure, and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center. Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. Heart failure can be divided into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. We also wanted to know if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n\nHow did we do the review? We searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we find? We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? The evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

The grade is 'NOT_APPROVED' to ensure these important clarity edits are made.\n\nHere are the top 3 recommendations:\n\n1. **Simplify research jargon in the 'Limitations' section.** The current wording uses technical terms that a lay audience is unlikely to understand.\n   - **Problem:** \"...the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace this with simpler language, such as: \"...the studies did not include all the types of people, treatments, or comparisons that are important.\"\n\n2. **Use more active voice to make sentences more direct.** The draft has several instances of passive voice, which can make the text feel less personal and harder to follow.\n   - **Problem:** \"Heart failure can be divided into two types...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase in the active voice: \"Doctors describe two types of heart failure...\" or more simply, \"There are two types of heart failure:...\"\n   - **Problem:** \"...the program can be delivered in different settings...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Make it active: \"...people can do the program in different settings...\"\n\n3. **Break up the long introductory paragraph with a bulleted list.** The first paragraph contains all the key messages, making it dense. Using a short introduction followed by a bulleted list for the key findings would make them stand out and easier to scan.\n   - **Problem:** The first paragraph is a 96-word block of text covering the study scope, main findings, and future research needs.\n   - **Suggestion:** Restructure the start to highlight the key messages, for example:\n     \"To find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can help adults with heart failure, we looked at 60 studies involving 8728 people.\n\n     **Key messages**\n     - Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital and may improve quality of life.\n     - It is not clear if it affects the risk of death.\n     - These benefits may apply regardless of the program setting (at home or in a center).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis identified three areas for improvement that align with the editorial feedback: the number of passive voice constructions (21), nominalizations (27), and total nouns (171) are all in the 90th percentile range. This suggests the text could be made more direct and active by converting passive sentences and replacing noun forms with verbs."
