  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? \nWe looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out. \nThe studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. \nWe found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. \nHowever, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. \nWe also found that participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure, and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center. \nFuture research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? \nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. \nPeople with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. \nHeart failure can be divided into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? \nCommon treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. \nExercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if these exercise programs help adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. \nWe also wanted to know if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n\nHow did we do the review? \nWe searched for studies comparing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise control, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess its effects on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. \nHowever, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. \nThe evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review? \nThis review updates our previous review. \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. All critical checks passed. However, it is not approved because there are several important opportunities to improve clarity and readability for a patient audience. Addressing the following 3 points will make the summary much more effective.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Remove the Repeated Limitations Statement**\n\nThe same sentence about the evidence limitations appears twice, back-to-back. This can confuse the reader and makes the summary feel unpolished.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** The sentence \"The evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting...\" appears at the end of the \"What did we find?\" section and is then repeated as the only text in the \"What are the limitations of this evidence?\" section.\n- **Suggested Fix:** Delete the sentence from the end of the \"What did we find?\" section and keep it only in the dedicated limitations section. This makes the structure logical and avoids repetition.\n\n**2. Simplify Sentences and Use More Direct Verbs**\n\nSome sentences are long and use noun forms instead of direct verbs, which can make them harder to follow. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found an exceptionally high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs).\n\n- **Problematic Sentence 1:** \"We searched for studies comparing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise control, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess its effects on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** At 38 words, this sentence is too long and tries to communicate too many ideas at once.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life.\"\n\n- **Problematic Phrase 2:** \"We also found that **participation in** exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Participation in\" is a wordy noun phrase. Using a direct verb is simpler.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We also found that **participating in** exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits...\"\n\n**3. Use Active Voice Consistently**\n\nThe style guide requires active voice, but several sentences use passive voice, which can make the text feel less direct. The analysis confirms this with a high number of passive constructions.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence 1:** \"Heart failure can be divided into two types...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is passive. It's clearer to state who is doing the action.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Doctors group heart failure into two types...\"\n\n- **Problematic Sentence 2:** \"...the program can be delivered in different settings...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is also passive and a bit abstract.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...people can do the program in different settings...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good overall readability, with half of the metrics falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it also reveals significant deviations from typical patterns in key areas related to style and complexity. The use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90). Additionally, the rates of passive voice, total nouns, complex words, and long words are all high (in the P90 range). These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that the text could be made more direct and easier for patients to read by simplifying sentence structures and using more active verbs."
