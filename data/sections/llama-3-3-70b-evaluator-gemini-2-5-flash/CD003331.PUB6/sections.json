  "key_messages": [
    "Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling to help people with heart conditions) likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life (the ability to perform daily activities and enjoy life, which is influenced by a person's experiences, beliefs, expectations, and perceptions) in adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should), but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (death) rates.",
    "Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)), and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center.",
    "Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and to address the limitations of current evidence, including the need for longer-term follow-up and more diverse study populations."

      "subheading": "What is heart failure and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. Heart failure can be divided into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for heart failure?",
      "content": "Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether ExCR is effective in reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and improving health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure. They also wanted to know whether ExCR is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted over a median follow-up period of six months. Most of the existing evidence base includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), primarily those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) programmes. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) undertaking ExCR in a home-based setting. The studies employed a usual care comparator with a formal no-exercise intervention, as well as a wide range of active comparators such as education, psychological intervention, or medical management. The overall risk of bias in the included trials was low or unclear. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources of the studies or the countries in which they took place. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), the studies were very small (imprecise estimates), and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021."
