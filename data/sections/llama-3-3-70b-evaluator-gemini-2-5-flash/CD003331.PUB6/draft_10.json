  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? We looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out.\nKey messages \n- The exercise program likely means people are admitted to the hospital less often and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure, but there is no clear evidence that it affects the risk of dying.\n- The exercise program may help people regardless of the type of heart failure, and people can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of the exercise program.\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. There are two types of heart failure: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood out well, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart muscle is too stiff to fill with blood properly.\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. The exercise program, a program of exercise and education, is also a treatment option to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if the exercise program helps adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. We also wanted to know if the exercise program is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether people can do the program in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\nHow did we do the review? We searched for studies that compared the exercise program to no exercise. We then compared the results and used them to rate our certainty about the evidence.\nWhat did we find? We found that the exercise program probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. People can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center, and it may help people regardless of the type of heart failure.\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? We have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, people in the studies knew if they were in the exercise group or not. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, which may affect the reliability of those results. Second, many studies were small and did not include enough older people, women, or people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure (HFpEF). This makes it harder to know if the results apply to everyone.\nHow up to date is this review? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start with excellent readability scores, but it is not approved due to a critical clarity issue and a style guide violation.\n\n**Critical Issue (Style Guide Violation):**\nOne subheading does not follow the required question format. The style guide states all subheadings must be questions.\n- **Original Text:** 'Key messages'\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'What are the key messages of this review?'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Define the core intervention.** The summary repeatedly refers to 'the exercise program' without ever defining what 'exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation' actually is. This is the central topic of the review and must be explained for the reader.\n    -   **Problematic Text:** The term is used in the first sentence and then immediately replaced with the vague phrase 'the exercise program' for the rest of the summary.\n    -   **Suggested Action:** In the section 'What are the common treatments for heart failure?', add a clear definition. For example: \"Another treatment is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. This is a program of supervised exercise, which often includes education and counseling to help people manage their heart condition.\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the definition of the two types of heart failure.** The current descriptions are technical and may be confusing for a lay audience.\n    -   **Problematic Text:** \"...heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood out well, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart muscle is too stiff to fill with blood properly.\"\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:** To simplify, try focusing on the core problem for each type. For example: \"One type is when the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood out properly. The other type is when the heart muscle is too stiff to fill up with blood as it should.\"\n\n3.  **Make the explanation of limitations more direct.** The phrasing about study bias is slightly wordy and could be simplified for easier understanding.\n    -   **Problematic Text:** \"First, people in the studies knew if they were in the exercise group or not. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, which may affect the reliability of those results.\"\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"First, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This awareness might have influenced how they answered questions about their quality of life.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nThe linguistic analysis shows a high number of nouns (188), which places the draft in the 90th percentile for this metric. This supports the feedback above; making the language more direct and verb-focused, as suggested in the rewrites, will help address this imbalance and improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and plain language. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.0) are excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the noun count is very high (188), falling into the 90th percentile. This suggests the text may be overly reliant on nouns rather than verbs, which can make sentences less direct and harder to process."
