  "draft": "# Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling to help people with heart conditions) help adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling to help people with heart conditions) likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life (the ability to perform daily activities and enjoy life, which is influenced by a person's experiences, beliefs, expectations, and perceptions) in adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should), but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (death) rates.\n- Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)), and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and to address the limitations of current evidence, including the need for longer-term follow-up and more diverse study populations.\n**Introduction**\n### What is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. Heart failure can be divided into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n### What are the common treatments for heart failure?\nCommon treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether ExCR is effective in reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and improving health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure. They also wanted to know whether ExCR is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise control, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess its effects on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted over a median follow-up period of six months. Most of the existing evidence base includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), primarily those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) programmes. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) undertaking ExCR in a home-based setting. The studies employed a usual care comparator with a formal no-exercise intervention, as well as a wide range of active comparators such as education, psychological intervention, or medical management. The overall risk of bias in the included trials was low or unclear. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources of the studies or the countries in which they took place. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), the studies were very small (imprecise estimates), and the evidence does not address all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues and significant deviations from plain language guidelines. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide.\n2.  **Factual Accuracy:** The 'Results' section includes an irrelevant editorial comment: 'Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources of the studies or the countries in which they took place.' This is not a finding of the review and should be removed.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Improve Readability by Shortening Sentences and Simplifying Vocabulary:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling to help people with heart conditions) likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life (the ability to perform daily activities and enjoy life, which is influenced by a person's experiences, beliefs, expectations, and perceptions) in adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should), but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (death) rates.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is excessively long (78 words) and contains multiple nested definitions, making it very difficult for a patient audience to understand. The overall text has a high average sentence length (28.71 words/sentence) and high vocabulary complexity, leading to poor readability scores.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is a program that includes exercise, education, and counseling for people with heart conditions. For adults with heart failure (when the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), ExCR likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their health-related quality of life (their ability to perform daily activities and enjoy life). However, there is no clear evidence that ExCR affects mortality (death) rates.\"\n    *   **General advice:** Break long sentences into shorter ones (aim for 15-20 words) and replace complex or long words with simpler alternatives where possible.\n2.  **Ensure all Subheadings are Phrased as Questions:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"### Methods\", \"### Limitations\", \"### Currency\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** These subheadings do not follow the Master Style Guide, which requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to improve reader engagement and clarity.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        *   \"### How did we do the review?\"\n        *   \"### What are the limitations of this evidence?\"\n        *   \"### How up to date is this review?\"\n3.  **Remove Irrelevant Editorial Comments from Results Section:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources of the studies or the countries in which they took place.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is an observation about the source material, not a finding of the review itself. It is factually inaccurate to include it as a \"result\" and deviates from the purpose of the section, potentially confusing readers.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Remove this sentence entirely.\n4.  **Reduce Passive Voice and Nominalization:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"The studies employed a usual care comparator with a formal no-exercise intervention, as well as a wide range of active comparators such as education, psychological intervention, or medical management.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence uses a less direct construction (\"employed a comparator\") and noun forms of verbs (nominalization), making the text less active and harder to follow. The metrics show a high number of passive voice constructions and nominalizations.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual care (no exercise) and other active treatments like education, psychological support, or medical management.\"\n    *   **General advice:** Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., 'Researchers found' instead of 'It was found') and use verbs instead of noun forms (e.g., 'decide' instead of 'make a decision').",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Only 16.7% of features fall within the best quartile, while 44.4% are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating substantial room for improvement. Key metrics showing significant deviation include:\n*   **Readability:** Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.01), Automated Readability Index (16.35), Gunning Fog Index (20.14), LIX (61.30), RIX (9.36), and SMOG Index (15.73) are all considerably higher than typical, suggesting the text is too difficult. Flesch Reading Ease (38.58) is also in the lowest quartile.\n*   **Sentence Structure:** Words per sentence (28.71) is well beyond typical patterns, confirming the presence of overly long sentences. Passive voice (31.00) is also significantly high.\n*   **Vocabulary Complexity:** Complex words (174.00), long words (262.00), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words (316.00), and nominalization (48.00) are all far above typical ranges, highlighting the need for simpler vocabulary and more direct language.\n*   **Nouns:** The noun count (274.00) is also significantly high, suggesting a noun-heavy writing style."
