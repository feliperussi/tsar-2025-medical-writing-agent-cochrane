  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure? We looked at 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure to find out.\n\n**Key messages**\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure, but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality rates.\n- Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure, and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a center.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting underrepresented groups, such as older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem? Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life, are at risk of being hospitalized, and have a higher risk of death. There are two types of heart failure: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where the heart does not contract properly, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where the heart does not relax properly.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for heart failure? Common treatments for heart failure include medications to manage symptoms, devices such as pacemakers, and lifestyle changes. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and feel better in their daily lives. We also wanted to know if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in different types of heart failure, such as HFrEF and HFpEF, and whether it can be delivered in different settings, such as in a hospital or at home.\n\nHow did we do the review? We searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence for its effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we find? We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on mortality. People can do the program in different settings, such as at home or in a center, and it may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? The evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the studies did not include all the types of people, treatments, or comparisons that are important.\n\nHow up to date is this review? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it can be made clearer and more direct for readers by addressing three main issues. The PLS evaluation supports this, showing high scores for nominalization (BEYOND_P90), nouns (P90), and passive voice (P90), which can make text feel dense and academic.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).** This makes sentences more direct and easier to understand, as recommended in the style guide.\n   - **Problem:** \"Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits...\"\n   - **Reason:** The phrase \"Participation in... may have benefits\" is indirect. Using a direct verb is stronger and more active.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Participating in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may be beneficial...\" or even better: \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may help people...\"\n\n2. **Break up long, complex sentences.** Sentences over 25-30 words can be difficult for readers to follow.\n   - **Problem:** \"The evidence is limited because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the studies did not include all the types of people, treatments, or comparisons that are important.\"\n   - **Reason:** This 36-word sentence contains three separate ideas, which is a lot for a reader to process at once.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Second, many studies were small and did not include a diverse range of people or treatments.\"\n\n3. **Simplify noun-heavy phrases.** Long strings of nouns can make the text dense and hard to read.\n   - **Problem:** \"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is also a treatment option, which involves a program of exercise and education to help people with heart failure manage their condition and improve their quality of life.\"\n   - **Reason:** This 32-word sentence is packed with nouns ('rehabilitation', 'option', 'program', 'exercise', 'education', 'condition', 'quality', 'life'), making it less direct.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Another treatment is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. This is a program of exercise and education that helps people manage their heart failure and improve their quality of life.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in three key areas: the use of passive voice (P90), a high number of nouns (P90), and a very high number of nominalizations (BEYOND_P90), where verbs are turned into nouns. These metrics suggest the writing could be more direct and active."
