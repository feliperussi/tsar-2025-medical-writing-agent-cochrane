  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n\nKey Messages\n- A new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole may be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. The studies provided very little information about potential harmful effects, so we are uncertain about the risks of this surgery.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong. The studies were small, and in some cases, the people assessing the results knew which surgery was performed, which could have biased the findings. Because of this, more research is needed to confirm the results.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a small break that goes all the way through the center of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). This hole can make you lose your central vision, which makes everyday activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. To treat this, surgeons often perform a procedure to peel away a very thin layer of tissue from the back of the eye. This review compares that standard 'peeling' method with a newer 'flap' technique, where surgeons use that same tissue layer to create a small flap to cover the hole. Doctors classify macular holes by their size. This review focused on 'large' macular holes, which are wider than 400 micrometers (a very small unit of measurement) and are often more difficult to treat.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if a new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole is safer and more effective than the standard technique, which involves peeling away that tissue layer. We aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that randomly assigned people to receive either the new 'flap' technique or the standard 'peeling' method (these are called randomized controlled trials). We then summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. The new 'flap' technique may improve vision more than the standard surgery when checked three months or more after the operation. It is unclear if there is any difference in vision one month after surgery. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies used slightly different surgical methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because there are several key opportunities to improve clarity for a patient audience by simplifying complex vocabulary and reducing redundancy. Addressing the 3 issues below will make the summary much easier for readers to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace Formal and Technical Words with Simpler Alternatives**\n\nSome sentences use formal language that can be hard for readers to process quickly. Simplifying these words will make the meaning clearer.\n\n- **Quote:** \"We aimed to find out if the new technique is **superior** to the standard technique in terms of improving **visual acuity** and **achieving** macular hole closure, and to **assess** the safety of the new technique.\"\n- **Problem:** The words 'superior', 'visual acuity', 'achieving', and 'assess' are more complex than needed. 'Visual acuity' is a technical term for vision.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to see if the new technique was better than the standard one at improving vision and closing the hole. We also looked at its safety.\"\n\n**2. Remove Redundant Sentences to Improve Flow**\n\nThe section explaining the review's goal says the same thing twice, which can make it feel repetitive. Combining these ideas makes the text more direct.\n\n- **Quote:** \"We wanted to find out if a new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole is safer and more effective than the standard technique... **We aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.**\"\n- **Problem:** The second sentence repeats the goal stated in the first sentence using different words. This isn't necessary and slows the reader down.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** You can remove the second sentence entirely and use the simpler version suggested above to cover the main points concisely.\n\n**3. Avoid Unnecessary Technical Jargon**\n\nThe methods section introduces a technical term for study design that isn't essential for a plain language summary.\n\n- **Quote:** \"We searched for studies that randomly assigned people to receive either the new 'flap' technique or the standard 'peeling' method (these are called **randomized controlled trials**).\"\n- **Problem:** While you explain the term, mentioning 'randomized controlled trials' adds complexity. It's better to just describe what the studies did in simple terms.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies where people were randomly chosen to receive either the new 'flap' surgery or the standard 'peeling' surgery. This method makes the comparison between treatments as fair as possible.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is well-structured and generally conforms to typical PLS patterns, with most readability and sentence structure metrics falling within the best quartile. However, the analysis flags a higher-than-typical number of complex and long words ('complex_words_dc' and 'long_words' are in the P90 range). This statistical finding supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary, as replacing some formal terms with more common words would improve reader understanding and better align the text with PLS standards."
