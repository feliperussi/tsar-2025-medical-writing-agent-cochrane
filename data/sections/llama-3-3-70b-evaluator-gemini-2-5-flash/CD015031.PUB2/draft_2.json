  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n \nKey Messages\n- A new surgical technique, using an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap, might be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of this technique, as the current studies had some limitations and were not able to provide clear answers to all the questions about treating these holes.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a full-thickness defect in the central portion of the retina that causes loss of central vision. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be classified based on their size, with large macular holes having a diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point. The standard treatment for macular holes is a surgical procedure called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, also known as the standard peeling surgery. However, the failure rate of this technique is higher for large macular holes than for smaller ones.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a new surgical technique, pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap, compared to the standard PPV with ILM peeling for treating large macular holes. They aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap and conventional peeling for large macular holes, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. All four studies compared conventional pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling versus pars plana vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting membrane flap techniques for treating large macular holes. The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision slightly for people with large macular holes. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery. However, it is unclear if this technique has an effect on vision one month after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, the language is too technical for a lay audience, making it difficult to understand key concepts. Here are the top 3 improvements to make it clearer for patients:\n\n1. **Simplify the definition of a macular hole.** The current wording is very clinical and may not be clear to a general reader.\n   - **Current text:** \"A macular hole is a full-thickness defect in the central portion of the retina that causes loss of central vision.\"\n   - **Problem:** Terms like \"full-thickness defect\" and \"central portion of the retina\" are jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"A macular hole is a small break that goes all the way through the center of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back: the back of the eye. This hole causes a loss of central vision.\"\n\n2. **Introduce the surgical procedures more gently.** The current text introduces several complex terms and acronyms at once, which can be overwhelming.\n   - **Current text:** \"The standard treatment for macular holes is a surgical procedure called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, also known as the standard peeling surgery.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a long, jargon-filled phrase. The acronyms PPV and ILM are introduced but never used again, adding unnecessary complexity.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The standard treatment is a type of surgery where a surgeon peels away a thin layer in the eye called the internal limiting membrane. We will call this 'the standard peeling surgery'.\"\n\n3. **Remove the repetitive sentence from the results.** There is a long, technical sentence in the results section that repeats information the reader already knows, which slows down comprehension.\n   - **Current text:** \"All four studies compared conventional pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling versus pars plana vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting membrane flap techniques for treating large macular holes.\"\n   - **Problem:** This 29-word sentence is redundant and filled with jargon. It comes right before the main findings, creating a barrier for the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please delete this sentence. The summary flows much better by going directly from describing the studies to stating what you found.\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found that the draft uses significantly more complex and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical patterns for sentence structure, with 77.7% of features in the median or best quartile ranges. However, the summary deviates significantly from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics—SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters)—are in the P90 range, indicating the language is more technical and uses more difficult words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
