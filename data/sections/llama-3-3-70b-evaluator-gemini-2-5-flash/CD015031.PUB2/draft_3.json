  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n\nKey Messages\n- A new surgical technique, using an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap, might be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of this technique, as the current studies had some limitations and were not able to provide clear answers to all the questions.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a small break that goes all the way through the center of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. This hole causes a loss of central vision. It can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be classified based on their size, with large macular holes having a diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a new surgical technique, pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap, compared to the standard treatment for large macular holes. We aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap and conventional peeling for large macular holes, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision slightly for people with large macular holes. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery. However, it is unclear if this technique has an effect on vision one month after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and structure. However, it can be made significantly clearer for a lay audience by addressing three key areas. The main issue is the use of complex medical terms and formal language, which makes some sections difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex surgical terms.** The full name of the surgery is technical and repeated without a simple explanation of what it is. This can intimidate readers.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We wanted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a new surgical technique, pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap, compared to the standard treatment for large macular holes.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** Phrases like feedback. The core difference between the two techniques (creating a flap vs. peeling) isn't made clear.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if a new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole is safer and more effective than the standard technique, which involves peeling away that tissue layer.\"\n\n2. **Make the main finding about vision clearer.** The summary of the results is a bit vague and could be more specific about when the improvement was seen.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision slightly for people with large macular holes.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** \"Slightly\" is imprecise. The abstract specifies that the benefit was seen at 3 months or more, which is an important detail for patients.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The new 'flap' technique may improve vision more than the standard surgery when checked three months or more after the operation. It is unclear if there is any difference in vision one month after surgery.\"\n\n3. **Use more direct and active language.** Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy and use noun forms instead of direct verbs.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"This hole causes a loss of central vision. It can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** \"Causes a loss of\" can be replaced with a more direct verb. The second sentence is good but could be combined with the first for better flow.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This hole can make you lose your central vision, which makes everyday activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult.\"\n\nBy making these changes, the summary will be more accessible and easier for patients and their families to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) falling within the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags two vocabulary metrics in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual number of complex and long words. Specifically, 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) is 225.0 and 'long_words' is 166.0. This data supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical terms and replace formal language with more common, everyday words to improve clarity for the reader."
