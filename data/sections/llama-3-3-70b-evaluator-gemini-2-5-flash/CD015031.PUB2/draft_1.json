  "draft": "# Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Using a surgical technique with an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap may be better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision), as it may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing, although harmful effects were not reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of this technique, as the current studies had some limitations and were not able to provide clear answers to all the questions.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n**Introduction**\n### What is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a full-thickness defect in the central portion of the retina that causes loss of central vision. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be classified based on their size, with large macular holes having a diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point. The standard treatment for macular holes is a surgical procedure called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. However, the failure rate of this technique is higher for large macular holes than for smaller ones.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a new surgical technique, pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap, compared to the standard PPV with ILM peeling for treating large macular holes. They aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap and conventional peeling for large macular holes, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. All four studies compared conventional pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling versus pars plana vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting membrane flap techniques for treating large macular holes. The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision slightly for people with large macular holes. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery. However, it is unclear if this technique has an effect on vision one month after surgery.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft is generally well-structured and factually accurate. However, it deviates from Cochrane Plain Language Summary guidelines in several key areas, primarily related to clarity, conciseness, and adherence to subheading formatting. The most significant issues are the use of overly long and complex sentences, particularly in the Key Messages, and the frequent use of technical and unfamiliar vocabulary. The 'Methods' subheading also needs to be rephrased as a question.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n*   **Subheading Format:** The 'Methods' subheading is not phrased as a question, which is a requirement of the MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"Using a surgical technique with an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap may be better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision), as it may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing, although harmful effects were not reported in the studies.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is 59 words long and contains multiple clauses and parenthetical explanations, making it very difficult to read and understand for a lay audience.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"A new surgical technique, using an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap, might be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Technical Vocabulary and Reduce Wordiness:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"...macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision)...\" (repeated multiple times). Also, the frequent use of \"pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling\" and \"inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** Repeating the full definition of macular holes makes the text unnecessarily long. The full surgical names are highly technical and contribute to the overall complexity, making the text less accessible.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** After the first full definition, refer to \"large macular holes\" or \"these holes.\" For the surgical techniques, after the initial full mention and definition, use simpler terms like \"the standard peeling surgery\" and \"the flap surgery\" or \"the new flap technique.\"\n        *   Example for repetition: In the second key message, change to: \"The quality of the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of this technique, as the current studies had some limitations and were not able to provide clear answers to all the questions about treating these holes.\"\n        *   Example for technical terms: In the Introduction, after defining PPV with ILM peeling, refer to it as \"this standard peeling surgery.\"\n\n3.  **Rephrase Subheading as a Question:**\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"### Methods\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE requires subheadings to be phrased as questions where possible.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"### How did we do the review?\" or \"### What methods did we use?\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n The PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS strongly support these recommendations. The `words_per_sentence` metric (25.38, P90) indicates sentences are too long. The `complex_words_dc` (284.00, BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (127.00, P90), `long_words` (211.00, BEYOND_P90), and `smog_index` (13.86, P90) all point to an excessive use of complex and unfamiliar vocabulary, making the text difficult for a lay audience. The `nouns` metric (169.00, P90) suggests the text is too noun-heavy, which can also contribute to complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile and 27.8% in the median range. However, several key metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns, indicating areas for improvement.

Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, with `complex_words_dc` (284.00) and `long_words` (211.00) both falling 'BEYOND_P90', and `complex_words` (127.00) in the P90 range. The `smog_index` (13.86, P90) also indicates a higher reading grade level than typical. Additionally, the `nouns` count (169.00, P90) suggests the text is noun-heavy, which can reduce readability."
