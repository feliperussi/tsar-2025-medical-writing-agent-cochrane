  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n\nKey Messages\n- A new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole may be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. However, we are uncertain about the risks of this surgery because the studies provided very little information about potential harmful effects.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong. The studies were small, and in some cases, the people assessing the results knew which surgery was performed, which could have biased the findings. Because of this, more research is needed to confirm the results.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a small break that goes all the way through the center of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). This hole can make you lose your central vision, which makes everyday activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. To treat this, surgeons often perform a procedure to peel away a very thin layer of tissue from the back of the eye. This review compares that standard 'peeling' method with a newer 'flap' technique, where surgeons use that same tissue layer to create a small flap to cover the hole. Doctors classify macular holes by their size. This review focused on 'large' macular holes, which are wider than 400 micrometers (a very small unit of measurement) and are often more difficult to treat.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see if the new technique was better than the standard one at improving vision and closing the hole. We also looked at its safety.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies where people were randomly chosen to receive either the new 'flap' surgery or the standard 'peeling' surgery. This method makes the comparison between treatments as fair as possible. We then summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. The new 'flap' technique may improve vision more than the standard surgery when checked three months or more after the operation. It is unclear if there is any difference in vision one month after surgery. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies used slightly different surgical methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

The following suggestions are intended to make a good summary even better by improving clarity for readers.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Make the Key Messages more specific and informative.**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The second key message is a bit vague.\n*   **Original Text:** \"The quality of the evidence is not strong. The studies were small, and in some cases, the people assessing the results knew which surgery was performed, which could have biased the findings. Because of this, more research is needed to confirm the results.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** While correct, the first sentence is a missed opportunity. Instead of just saying the evidence isn't strong, you can immediately tell the reader *why* in a more integrated way.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The quality of the evidence is not strong because the studies included small numbers of people and had flaws in their methods. For example, the people who checked the results often knew which surgery was performed, which could have biased the findings. Because of this, more research is needed to confirm the results.\"\n\n**2. Clarify the explanation of study limitations.**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The explanation of 'blinding' in the limitations section is slightly confusing and incomplete.\n*   **Original Text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received)...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The abstract highlights that the *outcome assessors* (the people checking the results) were not blinded, which is a key source of potential bias. The current text focuses only on participants and doesn't explain the issue as clearly as it could.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low for a few reasons. The studies included a small number of people. Also, in some studies, the researchers who checked the results knew which surgery each person had, which could have biased the findings. Finally, the surgical methods used were slightly different across the studies.\"\n\n**3. Replace complex words with simpler, everyday alternatives.**\n\n*   **The Issue:** Some words are more formal or technical than necessary.\n*   **Original Text:** \"...the people **assessing** the results...\" and \"No studies reported conflicts of interest or **disclosed** financial support.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Simple, common words make the text easier to read and understand quickly. This is especially important for readers with lower health literacy.\n*   **Suggested Rewrites:**\n    *   \"...the people **checking** the results...\"\n    *   \"No studies reported conflicts of interest or **shared information about** financial support.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nYour summary is very well-written and scores highly on most readability metrics. The suggestion to simplify word choice is supported by the `complex_words_dc` score (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), which was 215. This is slightly higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, and replacing a few words like 'assessing' and 'disclosed' will help bring this score down and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 77.8% of features fall within the best quartile for readability and clarity, including excellent sentence length (17.26 words) and high use of active voice. The single metric deviating from typical patterns is `complex_words_dc` (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), which is in the P90 range. This suggests that while the structure is excellent, the vocabulary could be simplified slightly to further improve reader comprehension."
