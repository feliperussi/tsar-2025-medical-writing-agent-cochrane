  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n\nKey Messages\n- A new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole may be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong. The studies were small, and in some cases, the people assessing the results knew which surgery was performed, which could have biased the findings. Because of this, more research is needed to confirm the results.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a small break that goes all the way through the center of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). This hole can make you lose your central vision, which makes everyday activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Doctors classify macular holes by their size. This review focused on 'large' macular holes, which are wider than 400 micrometers (a very small unit of measurement) and are often more difficult to treat.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if a new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole is safer and more effective than the standard technique, which involves peeling away that tissue layer. We aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that randomly assigned people to receive either the new 'flap' technique or the standard 'peeling' method (these are called randomized controlled trials). We then summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. The new 'flap' technique may improve vision more than the standard surgery when checked three months or more after the operation. It is unclear if there is any difference in vision one month after surgery. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft with excellent readability scores. However, a few key revisions are needed to improve clarity and accuracy for the reader before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Clarify the statement on harmful effects.**\n   - **The issue:** The Key Messages state, \"No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\" This could mislead a reader into thinking the technique is proven to be safe. The original abstract shows that safety data was very limited, with only one study reporting on one specific complication.\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Stating \"no harmful effects were reported\" is not the same as \"there were no harmful effects.\" We need to be precise about the lack of evidence.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please change the sentence to be more cautious and accurate, for example: \"The studies provided very little information about potential harmful effects, so we are uncertain about the risks of this surgery.\"\n\n2. **Explain the two surgical techniques more clearly and early on.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary compares the 'flap' technique to the 'peeling' method, but it doesn't clearly explain what these are until late in the text. The reader encounters these terms in the title and key messages without context.\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Without a simple, early explanation, the reader may struggle to understand the core comparison of the review.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** In the section \"What is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\", please add a brief explanation of the two surgeries. For example: \"To treat this, surgeons often perform a procedure to peel away a very thin layer of tissue from the back of the eye. This review compares that standard 'peeling' method with a newer 'flap' technique, where surgeons use that same tissue layer to create a small flap to cover the hole.\"\n\n3. **Simplify technical phrasing in the 'Limitations' section.**\n   - **The issue:** The limitations section contains some clinical trial jargon. For example: \"...varied methods of delivering the intervention.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like this are unclear to a lay audience. The goal is to use everyday language.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please rephrase this to be more direct. For example, instead of \"varied methods of delivering the intervention,\" you could write \"the studies used slightly different surgical methods.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of its features falling within the best quartile for readability and structure. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.4) are excellent. The one area of statistical deviation is the use of Dale-Chall complex words (complex_words_dc), which is higher than typical. This metric supports the editorial feedback to simplify some of the more technical or academic phrasing to ensure maximum clarity for a lay audience."
