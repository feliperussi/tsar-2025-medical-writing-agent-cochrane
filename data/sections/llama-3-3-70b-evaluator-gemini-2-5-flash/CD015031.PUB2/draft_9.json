  "draft": "# Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than a standard technique for treating large macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Comparing a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap to a standard technique for treating large macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision), the evidence suggests that the internal limiting membrane flap technique may be better for improving vision and closing the hole, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The studies included in the review had some limitations, such as not being able to mask the surgeons to the techniques being used, which might affect the results, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of these techniques.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that compare these two techniques directly, using standardized measures of vision, and reporting on any unwanted effects, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best treatment for large macular holes.\n**Introduction**\n### What is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a full-thickness defect in the central portion of the retina that causes loss of central vision. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be idiopathic (occurring without a known cause), traumatic (resulting from injury), or myopic (related to nearsightedness). Large macular holes, with a diameter greater than 400 µm, are particularly challenging to treat and often have a higher failure rate with standard treatments.\n### What are the common treatments for macular holes and what are their limitations?\nThe standard treatment for macular holes is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. However, this technique has a higher failure rate for large macular holes compared to smaller ones. Some studies have suggested that the inverted ILM flap technique may be superior to conventional ILM peeling for managing large macular holes, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique compared to pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for treating large macular holes. They wanted to determine if the inverted ILM flap technique is superior to ILM peeling in terms of anatomical and functional outcomes, such as best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular hole closure rates.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nA systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed to identify studies that directly compared pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique versus conventional ILM peeling for large macular holes. Keywords included \"pars plana vitrectomy\", \"internal limiting membrane flap\", \"ILM peeling\", \"large macular hole\", and related synonyms. No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional studies.\n### Eligibility Criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective comparative studies that reported anatomical closure rates, visual acuity outcomes, or complication rates for the two surgical techniques in eyes with macular holes larger than 400 µm. Studies lacking a direct comparison group, those involving combined procedures (e.g., cataract extraction), or with insufficient outcome data were excluded.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, sample size, patient demographics, hole size, surgical details, primary outcomes (hole closure, best‑corrected visual acuity improvement), and secondary outcomes (post‑operative complications). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated using a random‑effects model.\n### Risk of Bias and Confidence Assessment\nThe risk of bias for randomized trials was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, while observational studies were evaluated using the Newcastle‑Ottawa Scale. Overall confidence in the body of evidence was graded using the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. All four studies compared conventional pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling versus pars plana vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting membrane flap techniques for treating large macular holes. The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision slightly and probably increases the chances of the hole in the macular closing compared to the standard ILM peeling technique. However, it is unclear if the inverted ILM flap technique has an effect on vision one month after surgery.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded, had very small sample sizes, and were heterogeneous in participant populations and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. A high proportion of features (72.2%) fall into the 'Beyond P90' range, and one feature (5.6%) is in the 'P10' range, suggesting substantial areas for improvement.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   **Readability:** All readability indices (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, Dale-Chall Readability, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, LIX, RIX) indicate the text is much harder to read than typical PLS texts. For example, Flesch Reading Ease is 32.18 (P10), far below the median of 40.5, and Flesch-Kincaid Grade is 16.06 (BEYOND_P90), significantly higher than the median of 13.2.\n*   **Sentence Structure:** The average sentence length (`words_per_sentence` at 29.34, BEYOND_P90) is too high, and there is an excessive use of passive voice (`passive_voice` at 33.00, BEYOND_P90), both contributing to reduced clarity.\n*   **Vocabulary Complexity:** The draft uses too many complex words (`complex_words_dc` at 441.00, `complex_words` at 225.00, `long_words` at 336.00, all BEYOND_P90) and too many nominalizations (`nominalization` at 22.00, P90), making the language less accessible.\n*   **Plain Language Elements:** The text is too noun‑heavy (`nouns` at 264.00, BEYOND_P90), which can make it dense and less engaging.\n\nThese metric deviations confirm the need to shorten sentences, simplify vocabulary, reduce passive voice, and use more direct, active phrasing."
