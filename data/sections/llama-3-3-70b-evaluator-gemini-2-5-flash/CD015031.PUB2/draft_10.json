  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than a standard technique for treating large macular holes?\nWe compared two surgical techniques for large macular holes: one using an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap, and a standard technique. The flap technique may improve vision and close the hole more effectively. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\nThe studies included in the review had some limitations, such as not being able to mask the surgeons to the techniques being used, which might affect the results, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of these techniques.\nFuture research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that compare these two techniques directly, using standardized measures of vision, and reporting on any unwanted effects, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best treatment for large macular holes.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a complete tear in the center of the retina that causes loss of central vision. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be idiopathic (occurring without a known cause), traumatic (resulting from injury), or myopic (related to nearsightedness). Large macular holes, with a diameter greater than 400 µm, are particularly challenging to treat and often have a higher failure rate with standard treatments.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for macular holes and what are their limitations?\nThe standard treatment for macular holes is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. However, this technique has a higher failure rate for large macular holes compared to smaller ones. Some studies have suggested that the inverted ILM flap technique may be superior to conventional ILM peeling for managing large macular holes, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique compared to pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for treating large macular holes. We wanted to determine if the inverted ILM flap technique is superior to ILM peeling in terms of anatomical and functional outcomes, such as best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular hole closure rates.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registries to find studies that directly compared pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique versus conventional ILM peeling for large macular holes. We used keywords such as \"pars plana vitrectomy\", \"internal limiting membrane flap\", \"ILM peeling\", \"large macular hole\", and related synonyms. No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional studies.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated PPV with ILM peeling versus PPV with inverted ILM flap for treatment of large macular holes (with a basal diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point measured by optical coherence tomography) of any type (idiopathic, traumatic, or myopic).\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. We summarized the results qualitatively, and where appropriate, we calculated pooled effect estimates using a random-effects model.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four RCTs (285 eyes of 275 participants) that compared conventional PPV with ILM peeling versus PPV with inverted ILM flap techniques for treating large macular holes. Most participants were women (63%), and of older age (range of means 59.4 to 66 years). The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No RCTs reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision slightly and probably increases the chances of the hole in the macular closing compared to the standard ILM peeling technique. However, it is unclear if the inverted ILM flap technique has an effect on vision one month after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded, had very small sample sizes, and were heterogeneous in participant populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

However, the language is often too technical for a lay audience, making it difficult to understand. The key improvements needed are to simplify complex terms and sentence structures. Here are the top 3 areas to focus on:\\n\\n1. **Explain essential jargon.** The summary uses technical terms like 'pars plana vitrectomy (PPV)' without explaining what they mean in simple terms. This can alienate readers who are unfamiliar with eye surgery.\\n\\n   - **Original Text:** \\\"The standard treatment for macular holes is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** A patient won't know what 'pars plana vitrectomy' is. Defining it is crucial to understanding the treatment.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"The standard treatment is a type of eye surgery called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). During this surgery, doctors peel away a very thin layer of tissue from the back of the eye, called the internal limiting membrane (ILM).\\\"\\n\\n2. **Simplify long, technical sentences.** Several sections contain long sentences that are packed with technical details, making them hard to follow. This is especially true in the 'What did the review authors want to find out?' and 'What were the inclusion criteria...' sections.\\n\\n   - **Original Text:** \\\"We aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique compared to pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for treating large macular holes.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is 36 words long and repeats complex terminology. It's more like a technical objective than a plain language question.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"We wanted to find out which surgery is better and safer for treating large macular holes: the standard ILM peeling technique or the newer inverted ILM flap technique.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Use more direct, active language.** Some sentences use a passive or academic tone that makes the information less clear. Using simpler verbs and a more direct style will help readers understand what was done.\\n\\n   - **Original Text:** \\\"We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** This is vague and uses jargon ('methodological procedures', 'body of evidence'). It doesn't clearly explain the actions taken.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"We followed standard Cochrane methods to find and analyze the evidence. We then used a system called GRADE to rate how certain we are about the results.\\\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like sentence length are within the median range, several key readability and complexity scores deviate significantly. Specifically, the SMOG index (16.11), Dale-Chall score (8.24), and counts for complex words (180) and long words (266) are all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more difficult than in a typical PLS. The high number of passive voice constructions (23) also contributes to a style that is less direct and harder for lay readers to follow."
