  "draft": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n\nKey Messages\n- A new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole may be better for treating large macular holes. This technique may improve vision and increase the chances of the hole closing. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the long-term effects of this technique, as the current studies had some limitations and were not able to provide clear answers to all the questions.\n- Future studies should investigate this technique further, including its potential benefits and risks, and compare it directly with the standard peeling method to provide more reliable evidence for people with large macular holes and for the doctors treating them.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a small break that goes all the way through the center of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). This hole can make you lose your central vision, which makes everyday activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be classified based on their size, with large macular holes having a diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if a new surgical technique that creates a small flap of tissue to cover the hole is safer and more effective than the standard technique, which involves peeling away that tissue layer. We aimed to find out if the new technique is superior to the standard technique in terms of improving visual acuity and achieving macular hole closure, and to assess the safety of the new technique.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing the new surgical technique with the standard peeling method for large macular holes, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from three months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. The new 'flap' technique may improve vision more than the standard surgery when checked three months or more after the operation. It is unclear if there is any difference in vision one month after surgery. For every 100 people who have this surgery, 10 more may have their macular hole closed compared to those who have the standard surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

The following 3 suggestions are intended to refine the text and make it even more accessible for a lay audience before final approval.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Make the 'Limitations' Key Message More Specific**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"...the current studies had some limitations and were not able to provide clear answers to all the questions.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This statement is too general. It tells the reader there are limitations but doesn't explain what they are, which can reduce trust or leave them with unanswered questions.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The quality of the evidence is not strong. The studies were small, and in some cases, the people assessing the results knew which surgery was performed, which could have biased the findings. Because of this, more research is needed to confirm the results.\"\n\n**2. Add Detail to the Methods Section**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"We searched for studies comparing the new surgical technique with the standard peeling method for large macular holes, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a bit too brief. Explaining the *type* of studies you looked for (RCTs) is a simple way to build reader confidence in the review's methods.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that randomly assigned people to receive either the new 'flap' technique or the standard 'peeling' method (these are called randomized controlled trials). We then summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the overall evidence.\"\n\n**3. Simplify the Definition of a Large Macular Hole**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"Macular holes can be classified based on their size, with large macular holes having a diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"can be classified\" is slightly passive, and the symbol 'µm' may be unfamiliar to a lay audience. The sentence can be more direct.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Doctors classify macular holes by their size. This review focused on 'large' macular holes, which are wider than 400 micrometers (a very small unit of measurement) and are often more difficult to treat.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nThe linguistic analysis shows this draft is already highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns. The suggestions above are for refinement, not to fix major flaws. For example, while the overall passive voice count (11 instances) is well within the typical range, converting the specific phrase 'can be classified' to the active 'Doctors classify' makes the sentence more direct and easier to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, showing the draft 'HIGHLY CONFORMS TO TYPICAL PLS PATTERNS'. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong performance in readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10.41 is in the best quartile (P25), meaning the text is easier to read than at least 75% of typical Plain Language Summaries. These strong metrics confirm the draft's high quality, and the feedback provided is for minor refinements to further enhance clarity."
