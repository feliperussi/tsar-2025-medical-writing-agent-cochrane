  "draft": "# Can anti‑VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n**Key Messages**\n- Using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment before or during vitrectomy (a surgical procedure where the vitreous gel in the eye is removed) may improve outcomes for people with complications from diabetic retinopathy (a condition where high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the eye), by reducing the risk of bleeding in the eye and improving vision, although the quality of the evidence is not strong in all cases.\n- The use of anti-VEGF treatment seems to reduce the incidence of retinal breaks (tears in the retina) and the need for further surgery, but the evidence for these benefits is not certain, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the potential long-term effects of this treatment.\n- Further studies are needed to fully understand the effects of anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy complications, including its potential benefits and harms, and to determine the best way to use this treatment to improve outcomes for people with this condition.\n**Introduction**\n### What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Common treatments for PDR include vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel and blood from the eye, and laser photocoagulation, which uses a laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. However, these treatments can have complications, such as bleeding, retinal detachment, and cataracts.\n### What are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how do they work?\nAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medications that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. They work by blocking the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the growth of new blood vessels. Anti-VEGF agents can be injected into the eye to reduce the amount of bleeding and scarring caused by PDR. They have been shown to improve vision and reduce the risk of complications in people with PDR.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents in combination with vitrectomy can improve the outcomes of people with PDR. They looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications, as well as the need for further surgery. They also wanted to know whether anti-VEGF agents can reduce the risk of vision loss and improve quality of life for people with PDR.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### Error Explanation\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed. This usually happens when the task requires more steps than the system permits. To address this, consider simplifying the request, breaking the problem into smaller parts, or adjusting the iteration limit if you have control over it.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues, primarily the absence of a complete 'Results' section and non-compliance with subheading formatting guidelines. The 'Results' section currently contains an error message instead of the review's findings, which is a fundamental omission. Additionally, several subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the Master Style Guide. Beyond these critical failures, the draft exhibits significant clarity and style issues, including overly long and complex sentences, wordiness, and repetition, particularly within the Key Messages. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which indicates high average sentence length, frequent nominalization, and a high count of complex and long words, all deviating from typical Plain Language Summary patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns for 9 out of 18 features (50% in the best quartile). However, 5 features (27.8%) significantly deviate from typical patterns, falling into the P90 range. Specifically, the draft has a high average sentence length (words_per_sentence: 27.25, P90), indicating sentences are generally too long. It also shows high nominalization (24.00, P90), a high count of nouns (185.00, P90), a high number of complex words (complex_words_dc: 253.00, P90), and long words (183.00, P90). These deviations suggest the text is more complex and dense than typical PLS documents, requiring significant revision to improve readability by shortening sentences, simplifying vocabulary, and using more direct, active phrasing."
