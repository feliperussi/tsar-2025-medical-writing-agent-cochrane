  "draft": "Can anti-VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment before or during vitrectomy may improve outcomes for people with complications from diabetic retinopathy by reducing the risk of bleeding in the eye and improving vision.\n- Anti-VEGF treatment seems to reduce the incidence of retinal breaks and the need for further surgery, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the potential long-term effects.\n- Further studies are needed to fully understand the effects of anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy complications, including its potential benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Common treatments for PDR include vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel and blood from the eye, and laser photocoagulation, which uses a laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels.\n\nWhat are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how do they work?\nAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medications that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. They work by blocking the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the growth of new blood vessels. Anti-VEGF agents can be injected into the eye to reduce the amount of bleeding and scarring caused by PDR.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents in combination with vitrectomy can improve the outcomes of people with PDR. They looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications, as well as the need for further surgery.\n\nWhat did the researchers do?\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the researchers find?\nThe researchers found that participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better vision at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone. Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early and late postoperative vitreous cavity hemorrhage. Perioperative anti-VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the technical language in the 'Results' section.** The current text uses undefined jargon that makes the findings difficult to understand. This is the most critical issue.\n    *   **Problem:** 'The researchers found that participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better vision at six months... Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early and late postoperative vitreous cavity hemorrhage.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this section using everyday language. For example: 'We found that people who received an anti-VEGF injection in the eye along with surgery had better vision six months later than people who only had surgery. The treatment also lowered the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation.'\n\n2. **Use a consistent voice for the review authors.** The summary correctly uses 'we' in the 'Methods' section but then switches to 'the researchers' in the 'Results' section. This is confusing for the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** 'What did the researchers find? The researchers found that...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use 'we' consistently to refer to the review authors. Change the subheading to 'What did we find?' and the text to 'We found that...'\n\n3. **Ensure all subheadings are consistent with the text's voice.** The methods subheading should also reflect the 'we' voice used in its section.\n    *   **Problem:** 'What did the researchers do?'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change this subheading to 'What did we do?' to align with the first-person narrative ('We searched for studies...').",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling in the best or median quartiles. However, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The 'complex_words_dc' metric, which measures words unfamiliar to a general audience, is in the P90 range (219 instances). This confirms that the summary uses too much technical jargon, particularly in the results section, which hinders readability for patients."
