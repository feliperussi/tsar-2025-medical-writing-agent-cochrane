  "draft": "Can anti-VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment before or during vitrectomy may improve outcomes for people with complications from diabetic retinopathy by reducing the risk of bleeding in the eye and improving vision.\n- Anti-VEGF treatment seems to reduce the incidence of retinal breaks and the need for further surgery, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the potential long-term effects.\n- Further studies are needed to fully understand the effects of anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy complications, including its potential benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Common treatments for PDR include vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel and blood from the eye, and laser photocoagulation, which uses a laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels.\n\nWhat are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how do they work?\nAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medications that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. They work by blocking the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the growth of new blood vessels. Anti-VEGF agents can be injected into the eye to reduce the amount of bleeding and scarring caused by PDR.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents in combination with vitrectomy can improve the outcomes of people with PDR. We looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications, as well as the need for further surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that people who received an anti-VEGF injection in the eye along with surgery had better vision six months later than people who only had surgery. The treatment also lowered the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation. We also found that anti-VEGF treatment reduced the incidence of retinal breaks and the need for further surgery, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and very close to approval, but it fails on one critical check and has a key clarity issue that needs to be addressed.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n\n*   **Missing Subheading:** The methods section, which begins \"We searched for studies...\", is missing a subheading. According to the style guide, all sections should have a guiding subheading. Please add the subheading \"What did we do?\" above this paragraph to maintain the question-and-answer format.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Clarify the Certainty of Different Findings:** The draft combines two findings with very different levels of certainty, which may confuse readers about how confident we are in the results.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** In the 'What did we find?' section, you wrote: \"We also found that anti-VEGF treatment reduced the incidence of retinal breaks and the need for further surgery, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.\" A similar sentence appears in the key messages.\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The evidence for reducing retinal breaks was high-certainty, while the evidence for reducing the need for further surgery was uncertain. This sentence incorrectly applies the same level of uncertainty to both findings.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Please separate these points to reflect the evidence accurately. For example: \"We found strong evidence that anti-VEGF treatment reduces the risk of tears in the retina (retinal breaks) during surgery. The treatment may also reduce the need for more surgery later, but this finding is uncertain and needs more research.\"\n\n2.  **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases:** Some sentences are slightly wordy because they use noun forms of verbs. This is a minor issue, but improving it will make the text even clearer.\n    *   **Problematic Phrase:** \"...blocking the action of a protein...\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This is less direct than using a simple verb. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of these noun phrases (nominalizations).\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Change this to \"...blocking a protein...\" for a more concise and active sentence.\n\n3.  **Define Technical Terms in Key Messages:** The first key message introduces 'vitrectomy' and 'diabetic retinopathy' in parentheses, which is good, but the definitions are quite technical.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"...vitrectomy (a surgical procedure where the vitreous gel in the eye is removed)... diabetic retinopathy (a condition where high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the eye)...\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** While accurate, these definitions from the source text are long and interrupt the flow of the key message. The main text defines these terms better in the introduction.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Consider removing the parenthetical definitions from the key message itself, as they are well-explained in the following section, \"What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\". This will make the key messages easier to read quickly.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores are good, and the use of active voice is excellent. The primary area for improvement is a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests that rephrasing some sentences to use more direct verbs, as mentioned in the feedback, could further improve clarity."
