  "draft": "Is hospital care at home as effective as hospital care for older adults with acute medical conditions?\n\nKey messages:\n- For older adults with acute medical conditions, hospital care at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death) or readmission to hospital, but it probably reduces their likelihood of needing to move into residential care.\n- Hospital at home may improve patient satisfaction and probably reduces costs to the health service, but the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of hospital at home and compare different models of care.\n\nWhat is hospital care at home?\nHospital care at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require a hospital stay. This approach is used for a limited time period and is an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care.\n\nWhy is hospital care at home important?\nHospital care at home is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with hospital care at home compared to inpatient hospital care. They aimed to find out whether hospital care at home is a viable alternative to traditional hospital care.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies that compared hospital care at home with inpatient hospital care. We found 20 studies involving 3100 people, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\nThe review found that for older people, hospital care at home:\n- probably makes little or no difference to mortality (death) or being readmitted to hospital;\n- probably reduces the likelihood of needing to move into residential care;\n- may improve satisfaction with care; and\n- probably reduces costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, many of the studies were small, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. The populations and delivery methods varied across studies, reducing comparability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

However, a few minor revisions are needed to improve clarity and consistency for the reader before it can be approved. Here are the top 4 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Make the subheadings and text consistent.** The question in the methods section uses the third person, but the answer uses the first person. This can be slightly jarring for the reader.\n    - **Current text:** \"How did the review authors find the information? We searched for studies...\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Change the subheading to match the text: \"How did we find the information?\"\n\n2. **Clarify the uncertainty in the key messages.** The reason for uncertainty is a bit vague and could be more transparent.\n    - **Current text:** \"...but the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Be more specific about the quality of the evidence: \"...however, this is based on low-to-moderate certainty evidence.\"\n\n3. **Improve the phrasing in the results list.** One of the bullet points in the results section is phrased a bit awkwardly.\n    - **Current text:** \"...probably makes little or no difference to mortality (death) or being readmitted to hospital;\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Use more active and consistent language: \"...or the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital;\"\n\n4. **Simplify a technical term in the limitations.** The word 'comparability' is slightly abstract and could be explained in simpler terms.\n    - **Current text:** \"The populations and delivery methods varied across studies, reducing comparability.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Explain the impact more directly: \"Because the people and the types of 'hospital at home' care were different across the studies, it was difficult to compare their results directly.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical or best-quartile ranges for a Plain Language Summary. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.89) are excellent, and the use of active voice is high while passive voice is low, indicating a strong stylistic foundation. The suggested edits focus on minor refinements to further improve clarity rather than correcting statistical deviations."
