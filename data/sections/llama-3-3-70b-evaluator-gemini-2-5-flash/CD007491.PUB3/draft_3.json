  "draft": "Is hospital care at home as effective as hospital care for older adults with acute medical conditions?\n\nKey messages:\n- For older adults with acute medical conditions, hospital care at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death) or readmission to hospital, but it probably reduces their likelihood of needing to move into residential care.\n- Hospital at home may improve patient satisfaction and probably reduces costs to the health service.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of hospital at home and compare different models of care.\n\nWhat is hospital care at home?\nHospital care at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require hospitalization. This approach is used for a limited time period and is an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care.\n\nWhy is hospital care at home important?\nHospital care at home is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with hospital care at home compared to inpatient hospital care. They aimed to find out whether hospital care at home is a viable alternative to traditional hospital care.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies that compared hospital care at home with inpatient hospital care. We found 20 studies involving 3100 people, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\nThe review found that for older people, hospital care at home:\n- probably makes little or no difference to mortality (death) or being readmitted to hospital;\n- probably reduces the likelihood of needing to move into residential care;\n- may improve satisfaction with care; and\n- probably reduces costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias and small sample sizes. Many studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the populations and delivery methods varied across studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is not approved due to a critical factual omission in the key messages and a few areas needing improved clarity for a lay audience. 1. **CRITICAL - Inaccurate Key Message:** The second key message overstates the certainty of the evidence by omitting a crucial caveat. QUOTE: 'Hospital at home may improve patient satisfaction and probably reduces costs to the health service.' SUGGESTION: Add the context from the source material to accurately reflect the evidence: 'Hospital at home may improve patient satisfaction and probably reduces costs to the health service, but the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain.' 2. **Unclear Terminology in Limitations:** The term 'potential bias' is vague and unhelpful for a patient. QUOTE: 'The evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias and small sample sizes.' SUGGESTION: Explain the source of bias in simple terms: 'Our confidence in the results is limited because in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, many of the studies were small.' 3. **Wordy Phrasing:** Some sentences use formal language where simpler terms would be clearer. QUOTE: '...conditions that would otherwise require hospitalization.' SUGGESTION: Use more direct, everyday language: '...conditions that would otherwise require a hospital stay.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent readability, simple sentence structure (e.g., words per sentence is 18.00, in the best 25th percentile), and low use of passive voice. The required improvements are not related to these structural metrics but to factual accuracy and nuanced clarity for the reader."
