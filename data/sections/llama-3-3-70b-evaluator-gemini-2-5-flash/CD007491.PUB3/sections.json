  "key_messages": [
    "Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death rate) and readmission to hospital for older adults with acute medical conditions, and probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care, with no reported harmful effects.",
    "For older adults, hospital at home may improve satisfaction with healthcare and reduce costs to the health service, though the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "Future research should investigate the long-term effects of hospital at home and compare different models of care to better understand what works best for older adults with various medical conditions."

      "subheading": "What is admission avoidance hospital at home?",
      "content": "Admission avoidance hospital at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require hospitalization. This approach is used for a limited time period and is an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care. It is designed for patients who are aged 18 years and over, and can be used for a variety of medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and acute medical conditions."

    {
      "subheading": "Why is admission avoidance hospital at home important?",
      "content": "Admission avoidance hospital at home is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems, and may be more cost-effective than traditional inpatient care. Additionally, admission avoidance hospital at home can provide patients with more personalized and flexible care, which can lead to better health outcomes and improved patient satisfaction."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with admission avoidance hospital at home compared to inpatient hospital care. They aimed to find out whether admission avoidance hospital at home is a viable alternative to traditional hospital care, and whether it can improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance patient satisfaction. The authors also sought to identify the most important outcomes of admission avoidance hospital at home, including mortality, readmission to hospital, and quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 20 studies that involved 3100 participants. The studies were conducted to compare admission avoidance hospital at home with acute hospital inpatient care. Most of the studies recruited participants with a mix of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recovering from a stroke, and acute medical conditions, mainly in older populations. The studies assessed the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with admission avoidance hospital at home compared to inpatient hospital care, with a focus on outcomes such as mortality, readmission to hospital, and living in residential care. Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little to no difference to patient health outcomes, may improve satisfaction, probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care, and probably decreases costs. For older people, admission avoidance hospital at home may provide an effective alternative to inpatient care."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by several factors: participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, introducing potential bias; many studies did not report all outcomes of interest; the populations and delivery methods varied across studies, reducing comparability; and the sample sizes were generally small, limiting statistical power and precision.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
