  "draft": "Is hospital care at home as effective as hospital care for older adults with acute medical conditions?\n\nKey messages:\n- Hospital care at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death rate) and readmission to hospital for older adults with acute medical conditions.\n- It probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care and may improve satisfaction with healthcare.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of hospital at home and compare different models of care.\n\nWhat is hospital care at home?\nHospital care at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require hospitalization. This approach is used for a limited time period and is an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care.\n\nWhy is hospital care at home important?\nHospital care at home is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with hospital care at home compared to inpatient hospital care. They aimed to find out whether hospital care at home is a viable alternative to traditional hospital care.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing hospital care at home with inpatient hospital care. We found 20 studies that involved 3100 participants. The studies were conducted to compare hospital care at home with acute hospital inpatient care.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\nThe studies found that hospital care at home probably makes little to no difference to patient health outcomes, may improve satisfaction, and probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care. For older people, hospital care at home may provide an effective alternative to inpatient care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by several factors, including potential bias and small sample sizes. Many studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the populations and delivery methods varied across studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The summary is not approved due to a critical factual issue in the 'Key messages' section, which omits a key finding about cost reduction and inaccurately structures the other findings. This could mislead readers about the review's conclusions. Additionally, the 'Methods' and 'Results' sections could be clearer and more concise.\n\n1. **CRITICAL ISSUE - Incomplete Key Messages:** The key messages do not fully match the source evidence. Specifically, the finding that hospital at home 'probably reduces costs' is missing, and the main findings are split inefficiently across two bullet points.\n   - **Original:** '- Hospital care at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death rate) and readmission to hospital for older adults with acute medical conditions.\n- It probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care and may improve satisfaction with healthcare.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** '- For older adults with acute medical conditions, hospital care at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death) or readmission to hospital, but it probably reduces their likelihood of needing to move into residential care.\n- Hospital at home may improve patient satisfaction and probably reduces costs to the health service.'\n\n2. **Repetitive Methods Section:** The description of the methods is redundant and could be more direct.\n   - **Original:** 'We searched for studies comparing hospital care at home with inpatient hospital care. We found 20 studies that involved 3100 participants. The studies were conducted to compare hospital care at home with acute hospital inpatient care.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that compared hospital care at home with inpatient hospital care. We found 20 studies involving 3100 people, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n3. **Vague Results:** The results section uses the vague phrase 'patient health outcomes' and could be more specific and better structured to improve clarity for the reader.\n   - **Original:** 'The studies found that hospital care at home probably makes little to no difference to patient health outcomes, may improve satisfaction, and probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite (using bullets for clarity):** 'The review found that for older people, hospital care at home:\n- probably makes little or no difference to mortality (death) or being readmitted to hospital;\n- probably reduces the likelihood of needing to move into residential care;\n- may improve satisfaction with care; and\n- probably reduces costs.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10.16, 16 words per sentence). However, these strong readability scores do not reflect the critical content issues, such as the factual omissions in the key messages, which are the primary reason for not approving the draft."
