  "key_messages": [
    "Colchicine (a medicine that reduces inflammation) may help prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had any heart problems before, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about its benefits and potential harms, including unwanted effects like diarrhoea (a condition characterized by loose, watery stools).",
    "The current evidence does not allow us to conclude whether colchicine is better or worse than other treatments, such as placebo (a dummy treatment), immunomodulating medications (medicines that modify the immune system), or usual care (standard treatment), for preventing cardiovascular events (conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels).",
    "More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events, including studies that can provide more reliable evidence about its benefits and potential harms, and that can help answer important questions about its use in different populations."

      "subheading": "What is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a condition where the arteries become clogged with fatty substances, leading to chronic inflammation and potentially life‑threatening complications. It is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, accounting for a significant proportion of mortality and morbidity. Common treatments for ACVD often focus on managing symptoms and reducing risk factors, but there is a need for effective preventive measures."

      "subheading": "What is colchicine and how might it help with ACVD prevention?",
      "content": "Colchicine is an anti‑inflammatory medication that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions, including gout. Its potential role in preventing ACVD is of interest due to its ability to reduce inflammation, which is a key component of the disease process. However, the effectiveness of colchicine in preventing cardiovascular events in the general population is not well established."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the clinical benefits and harms of using colchicine as a primary prevention strategy for cardiovascular events in the general population. They compared colchicine to placebo, immunomodulating medications, or usual care, and evaluated its effects on outcomes such as all‑cause mortality, non‑fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and adverse events."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 15 studies that involved 1721 people who were randomised and 1412 participants were analysed. The studies were conducted with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks. The intervention was oral colchicine compared with placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care or no treatment. Most of the included trials focused on liver disease, rather than the general population. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, and study settings, including countries, were not clearly reported in the abstract. No information on study funding sources was provided. Colchicine may reduce all-cause mortality compared to placebo in primary prevention, but the evidence is very uncertain. Colchicine may result in little to no difference in non-fatal myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain. Colchicine may not reduce the incidence of stroke, but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding adverse events, colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete coverage of the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023."
