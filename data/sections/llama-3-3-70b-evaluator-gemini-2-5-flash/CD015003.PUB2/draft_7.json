  "draft": "Can colchicine help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events in people who have not had any of these problems before? We looked at the evidence to find out. Colchicine is a cheap drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been used for centuries. It might help prevent heart and blood vessel problems because it can reduce inflammation, a key factor in the development of the disease. However, we still do not know if colchicine can prevent these heart and blood vessel problems for most people. We need more and better research to find out its true benefits and harms.\n\nKey messages \n- Colchicine may reduce the risk of death from any cause, but this finding is very uncertain.\n- It may also increase the risk of diarrhoea.\n- We do not know if colchicine can prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular events in people without a history of these problems.\n\nWhat is heart and blood vessel disease? \nHeart and blood vessel disease is a condition where your arteries become clogged with fatty substances. This can cause long-term swelling inside the arteries and lead to serious health problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using colchicine to prevent cardiovascular events in people who have not had these problems before. We looked at studies that compared colchicine with a placebo, other medicines that affect the immune system, or usual care.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine to other treatments for preventing cardiovascular events. We summarized the results and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 15 studies that involved 1721 people. The studies lasted from 4 to 728 weeks. In these studies, researchers compared people taking colchicine by mouth to people taking a placebo, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or having usual care. Most of the studies focused on liver disease rather than the general population. Colchicine may reduce the risk of death from any cause, but we are very uncertain about the results. It may make little to no difference to the risk of non-fatal heart attacks, but we are very uncertain about the results. Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhoea. For every 10 people treated with colchicine, 1 extra person may get diarrhoea, compared to those not taking colchicine.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? \nThe evidence is not strong for a few reasons. The studies included were very small. Also, in some studies, people knew whether they were getting colchicine or a dummy pill. This can make the results less reliable, because people's expectations can influence the outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

This helps orient the reader.\n   - **Current text:** `Key messages`\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** `What are the key messages of this review?`\n\n2. **Strengthen the link between inflammation and the disease.** The rationale for testing an anti-inflammatory drug isn't as clear as it could be. Explicitly stating that inflammation is part of the disease process provides crucial context for the reader.\n   - **Current text:** `Heart and blood vessel disease is a condition where your arteries become clogged with fatty substances.

This process involves long-term swelling (inflammation) inside the arteries... Because this disease involves inflammation, we wanted to find out if colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, could help prevent it.`\n\n3. **State the limitations more accurately and strongly.** The draft understates a critical finding from the review—that almost all studies had a high risk of bias. This is a crucial piece of information for the reader to understand why the evidence is so uncertain.\n   - **Current text:** `Also, in some studies, people knew whether they were getting colchicine or a dummy pill.`\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** `In almost all of the studies, people and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting. The review authors found this created a high risk of bias, which makes the results less reliable.`",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile or median ranges for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 7.6 (P25) and the average sentence length is 14.7 words (P25), indicating the text is very easy to read. The required improvements are not related to sentence-level complexity but to style guide adherence and the precise communication of the review's context and limitations."
