  "draft": "Can colchicine help prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had any heart problems before\nWe looked at the evidence on using colchicine to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had any heart problems before - \n- Colchicine may help prevent heart attacks and strokes but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about its benefits and potential harms\n- We do not know if colchicine is better or worse than other treatments for preventing heart attacks and strokes\n- More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of colchicine for preventing heart attacks and strokes\nWhat is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a condition where the arteries become clogged with fatty substances leading to chronic inflammation and potentially life-threatening complications - It is a major cause of death and disability worldwide - Common treatments often focus on managing symptoms and reducing risk factors but there is a need for effective preventive measures\nWhat is colchicine and how might it help with prevention\nColchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions including gout - Its potential role in preventing cardiovascular disease is of interest due to its ability to reduce inflammation - However the effectiveness of colchicine in preventing cardiovascular events in the general population is not well established\nWhat did the review authors want to find out\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of using colchicine to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had any heart problems before - They compared colchicine to placebo immunomodulating medications or usual care and evaluated its effects on outcomes such as death from any cause heart attack stroke and adverse events\nWhat did we find\nWe found 15 studies that involved 1721 people - The studies were conducted over periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks - Colchicine may reduce death from any cause compared to placebo but the evidence is very uncertain - Colchicine may have little to no effect on heart attack but the evidence is very uncertain - Colchicine may not reduce the risk of stroke but the evidence is very uncertain - Regarding adverse events colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhea but the evidence is very uncertain\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and lack of information about the people and settings involved - More research is needed to provide reliable evidence about the benefits and harms of colchicine for preventing heart attacks and strokes\nIs the evidence up to date\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023",

Specifically, a required 'Methods' section is missing, and the entire draft is formatted as a single block of text without any paragraph or line breaks. This formatting error must be corrected first. Additionally, the summary omits crucial context about the study populations and provides a vague description of the evidence's limitations. The feedback below outlines the top 3 improvements needed to meet Cochrane standards.",

The text is parsed as only 3 sentences, resulting in an average 'words_per_sentence' of 153.0, which is far beyond the typical range (BEYOND_P90). Consequently, all readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Gunning Fog, etc.) are extremely poor (BEYOND_P90), indicating the text is unreadable in its current format. These metrics are not a reflection of complex language but a direct result of the missing paragraph and sentence breaks. Fixing the formatting is the highest priority."
