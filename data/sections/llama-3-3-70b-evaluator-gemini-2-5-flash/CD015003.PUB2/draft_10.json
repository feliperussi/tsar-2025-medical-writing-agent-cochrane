  "draft": "Can colchicine (an anti-inflammatory medicine) help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events in people who have not had any of these problems before? We looked at the evidence to find out. Colchicine is a cheap drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been used for centuries. It might help prevent heart and blood vessel problems because it can reduce inflammation, a key factor in the development of the disease.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review? \n- Colchicine may reduce the risk of death from any cause, but this finding is very uncertain.\n- It may also increase the risk of diarrhoea.\n- We do not know if colchicine can prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular events in people without a history of these problems.\n\nWhat is heart and blood vessel disease? \nHeart and blood vessel disease happens when arteries become narrowed by the build-up of fatty deposits called plaque. This process involves long-term swelling (inflammation) inside the arteries. Because this disease involves inflammation, we wanted to find out if colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, could help prevent it.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using colchicine to prevent cardiovascular events in people who have not had these problems before. We looked at studies that compared colchicine with a placebo, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or usual care.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine to other treatments for preventing cardiovascular events. We summarized the results and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 15 studies that involved 1721 people. The studies lasted from 4 to 728 weeks. In these studies, researchers compared people taking colchicine by mouth to people taking a placebo, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or having usual care. Colchicine may reduce the risk of death from any cause, but we are very uncertain about the results. It may make little to no difference to the risk of non-fatal heart attacks, but we are very uncertain about the results. Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhoea. For every 100 people taking colchicine, about 10 may experience diarrhoea, compared to about 3 of 100 people not taking colchicine.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence? \nThe evidence is not strong for a few reasons. The main reason is that the people in the studies were not the focus of our review. We wanted to know about preventing heart problems in the general population, but many of the studies we found focused on people with liver disease. This makes it very difficult to know if the results apply to most people. In almost all of the studies, people and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This can influence the results, because people's expectations can affect how they report their health. Studies are more reliable when no one knows who is getting the real treatment until the end. Most of the studies focused on liver disease rather than the general population.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023. We need more and better research to find out the true benefits and harms of colchicine for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have not had these problems before.",
