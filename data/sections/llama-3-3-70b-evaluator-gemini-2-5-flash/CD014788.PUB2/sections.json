  "key_messages": [
    "Hormone treatments (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues), also known as GnRHas (medicines that affect hormone production in the body), may help reduce pain in women with endometriosis (a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside the womb), but the evidence is not very strong and we are not certain about the size of the benefit.",
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the effects of GnRHas on bone health (the strength and density of bones), but there may be a slight decrease in bone density when using GnRHas, which could increase the risk of osteoporosis (a condition that makes bones weak and more likely to break) over time.",
    "Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of GnRHas on pain relief and bone health in women with endometriosis, as well as comparing GnRHas to other treatment options, to provide more reliable answers to these important questions."

      "subheading": "What is endometriosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that affects 6 to 11% of women of reproductive age. It can cause painful symptoms such as dyspareunia (painful intercourse), dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation), and infertility. Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions. The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to hormonal and immune system factors. Common treatments for endometriosis include medical therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), which can help reduce pain by decreasing estrogen production."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about GnRHas for endometriosis?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of GnRHas in treating painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. They also aimed to determine the effects of GnRHas on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis, as one of the adverse effects of GnRHas is a decrease in bone mineral density. The authors compared GnRHas with other treatment options, including placebo, danazol, analgesics, and intra-uterine progestogens, to evaluate their relative effectiveness and safety."

      "content": "To proceed, you can increase the iteration limit, simplify the task, or add explicit termination conditions so the agent can finish without hitting the limit."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential bias due to lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and very small sample sizes, which reduce statistical power and precision.",
