  "draft": "Can hormone treatments (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues) help reduce pain in women with endometriosis (a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside the womb), and are they safe?\n\nKey Messages\n- Hormone treatments, called gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), are medicines that affect hormone production. They may help reduce pain in women with endometriosis, but the evidence is not very strong, and we are uncertain about how much benefit they provide.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the effects of GnRHas on bone health (the strength and density of bones), but there may be a slight decrease in bone density when using GnRHas, which could increase the risk of osteoporosis (a condition that makes bones weak and more likely to break) over time.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of GnRHas on pain relief and bone health in women with endometriosis, as well as comparing GnRHas to other treatment options, to provide more reliable answers to these important questions.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and why is it a problem?\nEndometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that affects 6 to 11% of women of reproductive age. It can cause symptoms like pain during sex, painful periods, and difficulty getting pregnant. Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions. The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to hormonal and immune system factors. A common treatment is a medicine called a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa). These medicines work by lowering the amount of estrogen the body produces, which helps reduce pain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about GnRHas for endometriosis?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of GnRHas in treating painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. They also aimed to determine the effects of GnRHas on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis, as one of the adverse effects of GnRHas is a decrease in bone mineral density. The authors compared GnRHas with other treatment options, including placebo, danazol, analgesics, and intra-uterine progestogens, to evaluate their relative effectiveness and safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing GnRH analogues with other treatments, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effectiveness and safety of GnRH analogues for endometriosis.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSeventy-two studies involving 7355 patients were included. The evidence was very low to low quality. \n- GnRHas may help reduce overall pain in women with endometriosis, but we are not certain about the size of the benefit.\n- We are uncertain about the effect of GnRHas on bone health, but there may be a slight decrease in bone density when using GnRHas.\n- GnRHas may cause a greater loss of bone density compared to some other treatments. For example, women taking GnRHas alone lost more bone density than women who also took calcium-regulating medicines with their GnRHa treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential bias due to lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and very small sample sizes, which reduce statistical power and precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022.",

The main issues are overly long sentences and the use of unexplained technical terms, which make key sections difficult to understand. The feedback below focuses on the 3 most important areas for improvement.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify the 'Limitations' section by breaking it into a list.**\n\nThe current explanation is a single, 43-word sentence packed with technical concepts that will be hard for most readers to follow.\n\n- **Original Text:** \"The evidence is limited by potential bias due to lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and very small sample sizes, which reduce statistical power and precision.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is too long and uses jargon like 'bias', 'blinding', 'statistical power', and 'precision' without enough context.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n\"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This could have influenced the results.\n- Not all studies reported on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n- Many studies were very small, which makes their results less reliable.\"\n\n**2. Shorten sentences and use more direct language.**\n\nSeveral sentences are long and use formal, noun-heavy phrasing. Breaking them up and using simpler verbs will make the text easier to read.\n\n- **Original Text:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of GnRHas in treating painful symptoms associated with endometriosis.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is formal and a bit wordy. Phrases like \"assess the effectiveness and safety\" can be simplified.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well GnRHas work for endometriosis pain and if they are safe.\"\n\n**3. Explain or replace medical jargon.**\n\nThe text introduces technical terms without defining them, which can leave readers confused.\n\n- **Original Text:** \"Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The term \"adhesions\" is not common knowledge and isn't explained.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This happens when tissue like the womb's lining grows in other places, which can cause swelling, scarring, and areas where organs stick together (called adhesions).\"\n\nBy addressing these key points, you will make the summary much more accessible and useful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in its use of active voice and pronouns. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics are in the P90 range (higher/more complex than 90% of typical PLS texts): `nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, and `long_words`. This data supports the editorial feedback, indicating that the draft's vocabulary is more technical and its sentence structure more noun-heavy than is ideal for a Plain Language Summary."
