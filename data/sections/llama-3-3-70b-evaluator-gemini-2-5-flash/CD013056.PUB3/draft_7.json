  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotics applied directly to the ear (topical antibiotics) may stop discharge better than antiseptic treatments, but we are uncertain because the evidence is of low quality.\n- Topical quinolones (a type of antibiotic) are likely better at stopping ear discharge compared to boric acid (a type of antiseptic) at up to two weeks.\n- We need more high-quality research to be certain about the best treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Future studies should measure important outcomes like quality of life and report on any harmful effects, which were often missing in the studies we found.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum does not heal, which can lead to ear discharge and hearing loss. The infection is often caused by several different types of germs (micro-organisms).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nCommon treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically (directly to the ear) or taken systemically (orally or by injection). Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nWhat evidence did we find?\nWe searched for studies published up to June 2022 and found 15 relevant trials that included 2371 people with CSOM. The studies compare different types of antibiotics and antiseptics applied directly to the ear.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nTopical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that meets all critical requirements, including word count and factual accuracy. The linguistic metrics are excellent, showing the text is generally readable and well-structured. However, I am recommending a few revisions to address three key clarity issues before approval. These changes will ensure the summary is as easy as possible for patients to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define technical terms before you use them.** The key messages use the term 'chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)' before it is explained in the 'What is...' section. This can be confusing for readers.\n   - **Original Text:** 'We need more high-quality research to be certain about the best treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We need more high-quality research to be certain about the best treatment for long-term ear infections with discharge.'\n\n2. **Use simpler language for key findings.** The main result uses clinical phrasing that may not be clear to a lay audience. The original abstract also contained a very helpful plain language explanation that should be included.\n   - **Original Text:** 'Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Antibiotics called quinolones, when applied to the ear, are likely better at stopping ear discharge within two weeks compared to boric acid (an antiseptic). For every four people treated with these antibiotics instead of boric acid, one extra person's ear discharge will stop.'\n\n3. **Simplify and clarify the limitations.** The sentence explaining the limitations is dense and uses jargon like 'blinding' and 'outcomes of interest'. Breaking it into shorter sentences would improve readability.\n   - **Original Text:** 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies included were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect results. Also, the studies did not always report on important outcomes like quality of life or side effects.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. An impressive 89% of the metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and clarity (e.g., P25 for lower-is-better metrics like sentence length and grade level, and P75 for higher-is-better metrics like pronoun use). All 18 metrics are within the typical or best ranges, with no significant deviations. This indicates the text is generally well-structured with short sentences, common vocabulary, and good readability scores. The feedback focuses on qualitative improvements beyond what metrics can measure, such as the placement of definitions and the simplification of clinical phrasing."
