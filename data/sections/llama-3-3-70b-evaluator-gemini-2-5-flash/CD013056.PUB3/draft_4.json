  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge? \nWe looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that topical antibiotics (medicines applied directly to the affected area) may be more effective than topical antiseptics (substances that reduce the growth of microorganisms) for treating chronic ear discharge, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Topical quinolones (a type of antibiotic) are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid (a type of antiseptic) at up to two weeks.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current review to provide more definitive answers.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum does not heal, which can lead to ear discharge and hearing loss. The infection is often caused by several different types of germs.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nWe use antibiotics and antiseptics to treat CSOM. Antibiotics can be applied topically (as drops or creams directly in the ear) or taken systemically (by mouth or injection). Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nThe review included 15 studies with 2371 participants. Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that meets all critical requirements and scores very well on readability metrics. However, a few key improvements, particularly in the 'Key messages' section, will make it much clearer for readers. Here are the top 3 recommendations to finalize the summary:\n\n1. **Simplify the first key message.** The current version is a single, long sentence with two definitions in parentheses, which makes it difficult to read.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"- We found that topical antibiotics (medicines applied directly to the affected area) may be more effective than topical antiseptics (substances that reduce the growth of microorganisms) for treating chronic ear discharge, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Applying antibiotics directly to the ear (topical antibiotics) may work better than using antiseptic ear treatments to stop ear discharge. However, we are not certain about this finding because the evidence is not strong.\"\n\n2. **Replace clinical jargon with simpler terms.** The phrase \"resolution of ear discharge\" is used several times but is not common patient language.\n   - **Original phrase:** \"...increase the resolution of ear discharge...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...is likely better at stopping ear discharge...\" or \"...is more likely to clear up ear discharge...\"\n\n3. **Clarify the use of 'we'.** The style guide specifies that 'we' refers to the review authors. One sentence uses 'we' to refer to clinicians, which could be confusing for the reader.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We use antibiotics and antiseptics to treat CSOM.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Common treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics.\" or \"Doctors often treat CSOM with antibiotics and antiseptics.\",",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and simplicity. For example, the average sentence length (16.2 words) and use of passive voice (9 instances) are excellent. The nominalization score is in the 75th percentile, which, while acceptable, supports the editorial feedback to replace noun-heavy phrases like 'resolution of discharge' with more direct verb forms like 'stopping discharge'."
