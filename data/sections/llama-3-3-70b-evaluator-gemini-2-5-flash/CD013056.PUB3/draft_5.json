  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Applying antibiotics directly to the ear may work better than using antiseptic ear treatments to stop ear discharge. However, we are not certain about this finding because the evidence is not strong.\n- Topical quinolones are likely better at stopping ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current review to provide more definitive answers.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum does not heal, which can lead to ear discharge and hearing loss. The infection is often caused by several different types of germs.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nCommon treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically or taken systemically. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear. The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nThe review included 15 studies with 2371 participants. Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores, but it needs a few revisions to make it more helpful for a lay audience. All critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting have passed. My suggestions focus on translating technical details into plain language and making the key messages more specific.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the third key message more specific.**\n   - **The issue:** The final key message is too generic and could apply to almost any review.\n   - **Original text:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current review to provide more definitive answers.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"More and better-quality studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of these treatments. Future research should also include different groups of people and look at other types of antibiotics and antiseptics.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the description of the evidence search.**\n   - **The issue:** The methods section lists specific database names, which is technical jargon for a patient audience. The goal is to explain the process in simple terms to build trust, not to provide a technical list.\n   - **Original text:** \"We performed a systematic search of the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics for people with long-term ear discharge.\"\n\n3. **Make the first key message more concise.**\n   - **The issue:** The first key message is a bit wordy and indirect. A more direct statement would be clearer and more memorable for the reader.\n   - **Original text:** \"Applying antibiotics directly to the ear may work better than using antiseptic ear treatments to stop ear discharge. However, we are not certain about this finding because the evidence is not strong.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Antibiotics applied directly to the ear may stop discharge better than antiseptic treatments, but we are uncertain because the evidence is of low quality.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within acceptable ranges, with 11 (61.1%) in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.0, average sentences of 13 words). This indicates a strong foundation in terms of sentence structure and vocabulary. The feedback focuses on improving content clarity and audience appropriateness rather than fixing statistical deviations."
