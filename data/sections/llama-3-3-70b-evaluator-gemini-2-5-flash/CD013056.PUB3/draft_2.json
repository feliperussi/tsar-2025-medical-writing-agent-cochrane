  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge?\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. \n\nKey messages:\n- Topical antibiotics may be more effective than topical antiseptics for treating chronic ear discharge, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current review to provide more definitive answers.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nAntibiotics and antiseptics are commonly used to treat CSOM. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear. The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with CSOM. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nThe review included 15 studies with 2371 participants. Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
