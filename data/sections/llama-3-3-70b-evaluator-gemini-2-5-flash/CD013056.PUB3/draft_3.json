  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge?\nWe looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Topical antibiotics (medicines applied directly to the affected area) may be more effective than topical antiseptics (substances that reduce the growth of microorganisms) for treating chronic ear discharge, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Topical quinolones (a type of antibiotic) are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid (a type of antiseptic) at up to two weeks.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current review to provide more definitive answers.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (an infection caused by multiple types of microorganisms) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane (a thin membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear). The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nAntibiotics and antiseptics are commonly used to treat CSOM. Antibiotics can be applied topically (directly to the affected area) or administered systemically (through the mouth or by injection) via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nThe review included 15 studies with 2371 participants. Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and meets all the critical requirements for structure and accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the introduction to reduce jargon overload.** The first paragraph introduces four technical terms with parenthetical definitions, which is overwhelming for readers.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (an infection caused by multiple types of microorganisms) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane (a thin membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum does not heal, which can lead to ear discharge and hearing loss. The infection is often caused by several different types of germs.\"\n\n2. **Use consistent, personal pronouns.** The text switches between third person (\"the review authors\") and first person (\"we\"). The style guide requires using 'we' consistently.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to assess...\" followed later by \"How did the review authors search for evidence? We performed a systematic search...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Change all instances of \"the review authors\" to \"we\". For example: \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to assess...\" and \"How did we search for evidence? We performed a systematic search...\"\n\n3. **Remove redundant phrasing to be more concise.** Some sentences repeat information, making them unnecessarily long.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Antibiotics can be applied topically (directly to the affected area) or administered systemically (through the mouth or by injection) via the oral or injection route.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Antibiotics can be applied topically (as drops or creams directly in the ear) or taken systemically (by mouth or injection).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, several metrics related to vocabulary complexity, such as `complex_words`, `long_words`, and `nouns`, are in the P75 range. While still acceptable, this indicates a higher density of complex terms than is typical, supporting the editorial feedback to simplify jargon in the introduction."
