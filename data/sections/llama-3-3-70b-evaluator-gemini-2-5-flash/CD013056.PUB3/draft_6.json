  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotics applied directly to the ear may stop discharge better than antiseptic treatments, but we are uncertain because the evidence is of low quality.\n- Topical quinolones are likely better at stopping ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of these treatments. Future research should also include different groups of people and look at other types of antibiotics and antiseptics.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum does not heal, which can lead to ear discharge and hearing loss. The infection is often caused by several different types of germs (micro-organisms).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nCommon treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically (directly to the ear) or taken systemically (orally or by injection). Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear. The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics for people with long-term ear discharge.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nThe review included 15 studies with 2371 participants. Topical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start. The summary is factually accurate, complete, and meets the word count. The language is generally simple and easy to read. However, it can be made much clearer and more helpful for the reader with a few structural changes and clarifications. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n1. **Clarify the Key Messages.** The third key message is too generic. To be more helpful, specify what was missing from the current evidence.\n   - **Original Text:** \"More and better-quality studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of these treatments. Future research should also include different groups of people and look at other types of antibiotics and antiseptics.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a standard 'more research is needed' statement that doesn't give the reader specific insight into the review's limitations.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We need more high-quality research to be certain about the best treatment for CSOM. Future studies should measure important outcomes like quality of life and report on any harmful effects, which were often missing in the studies we found.\"\n\n2. **Strengthen the Methods and Results Sections.** The section explaining your search methods is just one sentence and feels disconnected from the results. Combining the search process with its immediate result (the number of studies found) creates a more logical flow.\n   - **Original Text:** \"How did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics for people with long-term ear discharge.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nThe review included 15 studies with 2371 participants.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The separation is awkward. The search *is* how you found the studies, so it's better to present this information together.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** You could combine these under a single, clearer heading:\n   \"**What evidence did we find?**\n   We searched for studies published up to June 2022 and found 15 relevant trials that included 2371 people with CSOM. The studies compare different types of antibiotics and antiseptics applied directly to the ear.\"\n\n3. **Define Key Terms at First Use.** The summary uses the word \"topical\" in the key messages but doesn't explain what it means until the background section. Readers need definitions immediately.\n   - **Original Text:** (In Key Messages) \"Topical quinolones are likely better at stopping ear discharge...\" (Later, in background) \"Antibiotics can be applied topically (directly to the ear)...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers may not understand the key messages if they don't know the terminology. Key terms should be defined the first time they appear.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Define the term within the first key message itself:\n   \"- Antibiotics applied directly to the ear (topical antibiotics) may stop discharge better than antiseptic treatments, but we are uncertain because the evidence is of low quality.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.5) and Words Per Sentence (14.5) are in the best quartile, indicating the text is easy to read at a sentence level. However, metrics for Nouns and Nominalizations are in the 75th percentile, suggesting a slight tendency towards noun-heavy phrasing, which can sometimes be improved by using more direct verbs. The feedback focuses on structural clarity and reader guidance, which are areas not fully captured by these metrics."
