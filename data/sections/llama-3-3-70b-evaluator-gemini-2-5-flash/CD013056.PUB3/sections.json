  "key_messages": [
    "Topical antibiotics (medicines applied directly to the affected area) may be more effective than topical antiseptics (substances that reduce the growth of microorganisms) for treating chronic ear discharge (a condition where the middle ear is inflamed and infected, often with discharge), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and harmful effects were not well reported.",
    "Another significant finding is that topical quinolones (a type of antibiotic) are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid (a type of antiseptic) at up to two weeks, but there is limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current review, including the lack of recent data, limitations in the quality of included studies, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions, to provide more definitive answers to the question of whether antibiotics or antiseptics are more of a better for treating chronic ear discharge."

      "subheading": "What is chronic suppurative otitis media?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. CSOM is a significant health problem that affects many people worldwide, causing discomfort, pain, and hearing difficulties."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?",
      "content": "Antibiotics and antiseptics are commonly used to treat CSOM. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation. The authors also wanted to evaluate the potential harmful effects of these treatments, such as serious complications or ototoxicity."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies comparing antibiotics with antiseptics in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. Keywords included \"chronic suppurative otitis media\", \"antibiotic\", \"antiseptic\", \"treatment\", and related synonyms. No date or language restrictions were applied."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "We included randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that enrolled participants diagnosed with chronic suppurative otitis media and compared an antibiotic regimen to an antiseptic regimen. Primary outcomes were clinical cure or improvement; secondary outcomes included adverse events and recurrence rates."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and follow‑up duration. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where data permitted, a random‑effects meta‑analysis was conducted."

      "subheading": "Risk of Bias Assessment",
      "content": "Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Domains assessed included randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "Overall confidence in the evidence was rated using the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low for each outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
