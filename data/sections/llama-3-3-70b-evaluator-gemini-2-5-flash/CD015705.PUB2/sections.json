  "key_messages": [
    "Hospital workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, which can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs, but it also has drawbacks such as replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among workers, and can lead to problems for patients, such as breaches of confidentiality when storing and sharing patient information on personal phones.",
    "The use of personal resources by healthcare workers can also lead to unequal access to care, as some workers may have better access to devices, internet, and skills to use them effectively, while others may struggle, highlighting the need for healthcare systems, to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to care.",
    "Future research should focus on finding ways to retain the benefits of informal solutions, such as increased flexibility and responsiveness, while reducing their negative effects, such as unequal access to care and potential breaches of confidentiality, and exploring how to strengthen formal health systems to support healthcare workers in their use of personal devices and resources, including providing training and compensation for their use."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?",
      "content": "Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones or other mobile devices to support their work, especially when their workplace lacks functional formal communication and information systems. This can lead to new challenges, such as the potential for unregulated use, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to resources."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals regarding their informal use of mobile devices to support their work. They wanted to understand how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices, the benefits and drawbacks of this practice, and how it affects their work and patient care."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets. The studies did not report the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, or the funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified. The study settings included various countries, but the specific locations were not detailed. The types of interventions and comparisons were not applicable in this review, as it focused on the informal use of mobile devices by healthcare workers."

      "subheading": "Main results: Healthcare workers' use of mobile devices",
      "content": "Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but can also lead to challenges such as replicating existing social hierarchies, deepening inequities, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality and the potential for healthcare workers to be distracted at work."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
