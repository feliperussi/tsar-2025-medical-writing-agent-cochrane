  "draft": "# How do healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of these informal solutions?\n**Key Messages**\n- Hospital workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, which can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs, but it also has drawbacks such as replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among workers, and can lead to problems for patients, such as breaches of confidentiality when storing and sharing patient information on personal phones.\n- The use of personal resources by healthcare workers can also lead to unequal access to care, as some workers may have better access to devices, internet, and skills to use them effectively, while others may struggle, highlighting the need for healthcare systems, to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to care.\n- Future research should focus on finding ways to retain the benefits of informal solutions, such as increased flexibility and responsiveness, while reducing their negative effects, such as unequal access to care and potential breaches of confidentiality, and exploring how to strengthen formal health systems to support healthcare workers in their use of personal devices and resources, including providing training and compensation for their use.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?\nHealthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones or other mobile devices to support their work, especially when their workplace lacks functional formal communication and information systems. This can lead to new challenges, such as the potential for unregulated use, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to resources.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals regarding their informal use of mobile devices to support their work. They wanted to understand how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices, the benefits and drawbacks of this practice, and how it affects their work and patient care.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies about healthcare workers' informal use of mobile devices, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets. The studies did not report the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, or the funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified. The study settings included various countries, but the specific locations were not detailed. The types of interventions and comparisons were not applicable in this review, as it focused on the informal use of mobile devices by healthcare workers.\n### Main results: Healthcare workers' use of mobile devices\nHealthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but can also lead to challenges such as replicating existing social hierarchies, deepening inequities, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality and the potential for healthcare workers to be distracted at work.\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues in factual accuracy and adherence to the style guide for subheadings. Additionally, the text exhibits significant clarity problems stemming from overly long sentences and complex vocabulary, making it difficult for patients to understand.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Factual Accuracy:** The paragraph under the 'What did we find?' subheading, starting with 'The studies did not report the total number of people who took part...', contains information not present in the provided SOURCE_OF_TRUTH or ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT. This unsourced information must be removed.\n2.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings ('Methods', 'Main results: Healthcare workers' use of mobile devices', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which violates the MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Hospital workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, which can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs, but it also has drawbacks such as replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among workers, and can lead to problems for patients, such as breaches of confidentiality when storing and sharing patient information on personal phones.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is 65 words long and attempts to convey too many complex ideas at once, making it extremely difficult for a patient to understand. The high 'words_per_sentence' metric (32.75, BEYOND_P90) confirms this is a pervasive issue.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices for work. This can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients. However, it also has downsides. For example, it can worsen existing social differences among workers and lead to problems for patients, like privacy breaches when patient information is stored on personal phones.\"\n2.  **Simplify Vocabulary and Reduce Noun-Heavy Phrases:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones or other mobile devices to support their work, especially when their workplace lacks functional formal communication and information systems. This can lead to new challenges, such as the potential for unregulated use, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to resources.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** Phrases like \"functional formal communication and information systems\" and \"potential for unregulated use, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to resources\" are dense and contain many complex nouns, hindering readability. The high 'complex_words_dc', 'long_words', 'complex_words', and 'nouns' metrics (all P90/BEYOND_P90) indicate this is a general problem.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Healthcare workers often use their personal phones or other mobile devices for work, especially when their workplace doesn't have good official ways to communicate or share information. This can create new problems, like using devices without rules, worrying about patient data privacy, and some workers having less access to these tools than others.\"\n3.  **Correct Subheading Format:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: Healthcare workers' use of mobile devices\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE explicitly requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader. These subheadings do not follow this guideline.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite Examples:**\n        *   \"Methods\" -> \"How did we do the review?\"\n        *   \"Main results: Healthcare workers' use of mobile devices\" -> \"What are the main findings about mobile device use?\"\n        *   \"Limitations\" -> \"What are the limitations of this review?\"\n        *   \"Currency\" -> \"How up to date is this review?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Only 27.8% of features fall within the best quartile, while 38.9% are 'Beyond P90', meaning they deviate significantly from typical patterns. Key metrics showing significant deviation (P90 or Beyond P90) include:\n-   **Sentence Structure:** 'words_per_sentence' (32.75, BEYOND_P90) is much higher than the typical range, indicating overly long sentences.\n-   **Readability Indices:** 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (16.33, BEYOND_P90), 'automated_readability_index' (18.50, BEYOND_P90), 'gunning_fog_index' (20.86, P90), 'smog_index' (14.14, P90), 'dale_chall_readability' (8.35, P90), 'lix' (66.34, BEYOND_P90), and 'rix' (11.00, BEYOND_P90) all suggest the text is considerably more difficult to read than typical PLS documents.\n-   **Vocabulary Complexity:** 'complex_words_dc' (279.00, BEYOND_P90), 'complex_words' (127.00, P90), and 'long_words' (220.00, BEYOND_P90) are all significantly higher than typical, indicating a high density of unfamiliar, complex, and long words.\n-   **Plain Language Elements:** 'nouns' (193.00, P90) is higher than typical, suggesting a noun-heavy writing style. These deviations collectively point to a need for substantial simplification of sentence structure and vocabulary to improve clarity and readability for the target audience."
