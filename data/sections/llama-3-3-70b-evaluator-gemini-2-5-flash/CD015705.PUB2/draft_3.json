  "draft": "How do healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of these informal solutions?\n\nKey Messages\n- Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices for work, which can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients. However, it also has downsides, such as creating unfairness between staff members in different roles and raising concerns about patient privacy.\n- The use of personal resources by healthcare workers can also lead to unequal access to care. Some workers may have better access to devices, internet, and skills to use them effectively, while others may struggle. This highlights the need for healthcare systems to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to care.\n- Future research should focus on finding ways to retain the benefits of informal solutions, such as increased flexibility and responsiveness, while reducing their negative effects, like unequal access to care and potential breaches of confidentiality.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?\nHealthcare workers often use their personal phones or other mobile devices for work, especially when their workplace doesn't have good official ways to communicate or share information. This can create new problems, like using devices without rules and worrying about patient data privacy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of healthcare staff who use their own mobile devices for work, including the benefits and problems of this practice.\n\nMethods\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies about healthcare workers' informal use of mobile devices, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets.\nWhat are the main findings about mobile device use?\nHealthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work. This helps them be more flexible and respond better to patient needs. However, it can also cause problems, like creating unfairness between staff members in different roles and raising concerns about patient privacy.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings. The studies we found took place in many different countries and healthcare settings, so the results may not apply to all situations.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This summary is not approved. While the writing style is clear and readable, the 'Results' section is critically underdeveloped and does not adequately summarize the review's main findings. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Expand the 'Results' section to include key findings.** The current section is too brief and repeats a key message.\n   - **Problem:** The section 'What are the main findings about mobile device use?' contains only one sentence summarizing the benefits and drawbacks, omitting crucial details from the original review.\n   - **Suggestion:** Expand this section to explain *how* phone use helps (e.g., 'it allows workers to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs') and detail the specific problems, such as the financial cost to workers (especially junior staff), the creation of a 'shadow IT' system where information is lost, and how patient privacy can be compromised, as detailed in the original abstract.\n\n2. **Replace the technical term 'cadres'.** This word is not common knowledge and will be unfamiliar to most readers.\n   - **Problem:** In the 'What did we find?' section, the text says '...and healthcare worker cadres.'\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace 'cadres' with a simpler term like 'roles' or 'professions'. For example: '...and covered a range of healthcare settings and worker roles.'\n\n3. **Make the first Key Message more specific.** The concept of 'unfairness' is too vague for the reader to understand the real-world impact.\n   - **Problem:** The first key message mentions '...creating unfairness between staff members in different roles...'. This doesn't explain the nature of the unfairness.\n   - **Suggestion:** Clarify this by explaining the issue more directly. For example: '...However, it also has downsides, such as creating unfairness, as junior staff may bear more of the costs for phones and data. It also raises concerns about patient privacy.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical median or best quartile ranges for Cochrane Plain Language Summaries. Readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.5) and structural metrics (e.g., words per sentence at 19.2) are excellent. However, these strong metrics reflect the text's simplicity and brevity, and they do not capture the critical issue: the 'Results' section is missing the majority of the review's substantive findings."
