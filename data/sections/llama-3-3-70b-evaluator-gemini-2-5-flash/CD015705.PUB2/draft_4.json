  "draft": "How do healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of these informal solutions?\n\nKey Messages\n- Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices for work, which can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients. However, it also has downsides, such as creating unfairness, as junior staff may bear more of the costs for phones and data. It also raises concerns about patient privacy.\n- The use of personal resources by healthcare workers can also lead to unequal access to care. Some workers may have better access to devices, internet, and skills to use them effectively, while others may struggle. This highlights the need for healthcare systems to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to care.\n- Future research should focus on finding ways to retain the benefits of informal solutions, such as increased flexibility and responsiveness, while reducing their negative effects, like unequal access to care and potential breaches of confidentiality.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?\nHealthcare workers often use their personal phones or other mobile devices for work, especially when their workplace doesn't have good official ways to communicate or share information. This can create new problems, like using devices without rules and worrying about patient data privacy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of healthcare staff who use their own mobile devices for work, including the benefits and problems of this practice.\n\nMethods\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies about healthcare workers' informal use of mobile devices, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and worker roles. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets.\nWhat are the main findings about mobile device use?\nHealthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work. This helps them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs. For example, it allows workers to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, and can give patients access to individual healthcare workers rather than generic systems. However, it can also cause problems, like replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among workers. Personal phone use costs healthcare workers money, which is a particular problem for lower-level healthcare workers and healthcare workers in low-income settings. Out-of-hours use may also be more of a burden for lower-level healthcare workers, as they may find it harder to ignore calls when they are at home. Additionally, healthcare workers with poor access to electricity and the internet are less able to use informal mobile phone solutions, while healthcare workers who lack skills and training in how to appraise unendorsed online information are likely to struggle to identify trustworthy information.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings. The studies we found took place in many different countries and healthcare settings, so the results may not apply to all situations.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. It meets many plain language goals, including good use of active voice and personal pronouns. However, it is not yet approved because a few key areas need revision to make the text clearer for a general audience. The main issues are the use of academic language and some overly long, complex sentences in the results section.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Replace abstract terms with simpler, more concrete language.** Some phrases are too academic for a plain language summary and may confuse readers. Simplifying them will make the key findings more accessible.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"...it can also cause problems, like replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among workers.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"replicating social hierarchies\" and \"deepening inequities\" are jargon. Readers may not understand what this means in a real-world context.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...it can also cause problems by creating unfairness among workers. For example, junior staff or those in low-income countries may have to bear more of the costs for phones and data.\"\n\n2. **Break down long sentences into shorter ones.** One sentence in the results section is over 45 words long and contains multiple complex ideas, making it difficult to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Additionally, healthcare workers with poor access to electricity and the internet are less able to use informal mobile phone solutions, while healthcare workers who lack skills and training in how to appraise unendorsed online information are likely to struggle to identify trustworthy information.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is too long and combines two separate points. The phrase \"appraise unendorsed online information\" is also very complex.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, workers with poor access to electricity and the internet can't easily use these mobile solutions. Others who lack training may struggle to judge if online information is trustworthy.\"\n\n3. **Remove repetitive phrasing.** In one instance, the same phrase is used back-to-back, which can make the text feel clunky and confusing.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This helps them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs. For example, it allows workers to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The repetition is unnecessary and weakens the point. The example should provide new information, not repeat the initial statement.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This helps them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs. For example, it can give patients direct access to individual healthcare workers rather than to general systems.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns. The draft scores well on structural metrics, with low use of passive voice and nominalization, and sentence length falling within the median range. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns, long words (7+ characters), and complex words from the Dale-Chall list are all in the P90 range, indicating they are much higher than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify complex terminology and replace long, abstract nouns with more direct phrasing."
