  "draft": "How do healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of these informal solutions?\n\nKey Messages\n- Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices for work. This can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients. However, it also has downsides. For example, it can worsen existing social differences among workers and lead to problems for patients, like privacy breaches when patient information is stored on personal phones.\n- The use of personal resources by healthcare workers can also lead to unequal access to care. Some workers may have better access to devices, internet, and skills to use them effectively, while others may struggle. This highlights the need for healthcare systems to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to care.\n- Future research should focus on finding ways to retain the benefits of informal solutions, such as increased flexibility and responsiveness, while reducing their negative effects, like unequal access to care and potential breaches of confidentiality.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?\nHealthcare workers often use their personal phones or other mobile devices for work, especially when their workplace doesn't have good official ways to communicate or share information. This can create new problems, like using devices without rules, worrying about patient data privacy, and some workers having less access to these tools than others.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals regarding their informal use of mobile devices to support their work. They wanted to understand how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices, the benefits and drawbacks of this practice, and how it affects their work and patient care.\n\nMethods\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies about healthcare workers' informal use of mobile devices, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets.\nWhat are the main findings about mobile device use?\nHealthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work. This can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but can also lead to challenges such as replicating existing social hierarchies, deepening inequities, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality and the potential for healthcare workers to be distracted at work.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for structure and accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of technical, academic language and a confusing explanation in the limitations section. The following 3 improvements will make the summary much easier for patients and the public to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace complex social science terms with simpler, everyday language.**\nSeveral key findings use terms that are common in research but may be unclear to the public. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of complex and long words was higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"This can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but can also lead to challenges such as replicating existing **social hierarchies**, deepening **inequities**, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"social hierarchies\" and \"inequities\" are abstract and may not be understood. It's better to describe the practical impact on people.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This helps them be more flexible and respond better to patient needs. However, it can also cause problems, like creating **unfairness between staff members in different roles** and raising concerns about patient privacy...\"\n\n**2. Make the 'Aims' section more concise.**\nThe section explaining the review's goal is repetitive. Combining the two sentences into one clear statement will make it easier to read.\n\n- **Problematic sentences:** \"The review authors aimed to explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals regarding their informal use of mobile devices to support their work. They wanted to understand how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices, the benefits and drawbacks of this practice, and how it affects their work and patient care.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence repeats the information from the first in slightly different words, which makes the section longer than necessary.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to understand the views and experiences of healthcare staff who use their own mobile devices for work, including the benefits and problems of this practice.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the 'Limitations' section.**\nThe explanation for the review's limitations uses language that is confusing and not relevant to this type of review.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"We are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of **delivering the intervention**...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This review summarizes experiences and views, it does not look at the effects of an 'intervention'. This phrase is likely to confuse readers, as no intervention was tested.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are moderately confident in our findings. The studies we found took place in many different countries and healthcare settings, so the results may not apply to all situations.\"\n\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns. Sentence structure is strong, with low use of passive voice (P25) and appropriate sentence length (P50). However, the analysis identified significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and 'long_words' are in the P90 range, indicating that the text uses more uncommon and long words than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms to improve readability for a lay audience."
