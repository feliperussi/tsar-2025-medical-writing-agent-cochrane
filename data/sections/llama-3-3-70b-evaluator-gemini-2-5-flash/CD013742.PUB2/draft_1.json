Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining good health, and its deficiency can lead to poor growth, impaired immune responses, increased incidence of disease, ocular impairments, and even maternal and child mortality. It is essential to diagnose and manage vitamin A deficiency effectively to prevent these complications.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the accuracy of index tests used to diagnose subclinical vitamin A deficiency in individuals at risk. They wanted to find out how well these tests can identify people with vitamin A deficiency and distinguish them from those without the condition. The authors also explored the sources of heterogeneity that might affect the accuracy of these index tests.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe conducted a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating vitamin A deficiency tests, using predefined keywords and inclusion criteria.\n### Data Synthesis\nRelevant data from the identified studies were extracted and combined using meta‑analytic techniques to estimate pooled diagnostic accuracy.\n### Confidence Assessment\nThe overall confidence in the evidence was appraised with the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 40 studies that involved a total of 385 to 1295 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, without any restriction on age, sex, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, physiological condition, or living location. Most studies were cross-sectional or cohort-accuracy studies, and some were longitudinal or interventional studies. The studies evaluated the accuracy of different index tests, including serum or plasma retinol, retinol-binding protein, and relative dose response, against reference standards such as retinol isotope dilution and liver vitamin A. The duration of the studies was not specified, as the review focused on the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests rather than the duration of the studies themselves. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not consistently reported across the studies, but the studies generally included individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. No studies were found that evaluated modified relative dose response, and only one study evaluated breast milk vitamin A versus retinol isotope dilution. The review found that methods to determine vitamin A deficiency had generally low sensitivity and high specificity in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. It is unclear if these methods have an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nThe studies were not designed to accurately measure the intervention effect, they had very small sample sizes, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes, limiting confidence in the findings.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

The Methods section subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the style guide. A statement in the Results section is not supported by the original abstract. The text suffers from overly long and complex sentences, and the use of technical jargon makes it difficult for a lay audience to understand. There is also an excessive use of nominalizations and passive voice.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** The subheadings in the Methods section are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide. This affects consistency and readability.\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"### Search Strategy\", \"### Data Synthesis\", \"### Confidence Assessment\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        *   \"### How did we search for studies?\"\n        *   \"### How did we combine the study data?\"\n        *   \"### How confident are we in the evidence?\"\n2.  **Factual Accuracy in Results:** The statement \"It is unclear if these methods have an effect on outcome.\" is not directly supported as a finding in the original abstract's results section. This review focuses on diagnostic accuracy, not intervention effects on outcomes, and this statement is more appropriate for a limitations discussion.\n    *   **Specific quote:** \"It is unclear if these methods have an effect on outcome.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Remove this sentence from the Results section.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Sentence Length and Jargon in Key Messages:** The first key message is an extremely long sentence that attempts to define complex terms (sensitivity, specificity) within it, making it very dense and hard to understand for a lay audience.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft text deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. Most readability indices (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, LIX, RIX, Automated Readability Index) indicate the text is much harder to read than typical PLS, requiring a higher educational level. Sentence structure is problematic, with an average of 28.27 words per sentence (Beyond P90), far exceeding the typical range. Vocabulary complexity is also a major concern, with high counts of nominalizations (29.00, Beyond P90), nouns (243.00, Beyond P90), complex words (193.00, Beyond P90), and long words (258.00, Beyond P90). These metrics collectively suggest the text is too dense, uses too much jargon, and has overly long sentences, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand."
