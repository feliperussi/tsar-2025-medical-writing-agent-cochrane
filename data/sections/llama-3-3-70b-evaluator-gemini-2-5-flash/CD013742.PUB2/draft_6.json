  "draft": "How accurate are blood tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk of having low levels of vitamin A?\n\n- We found that blood tests for vitamin A deficiency might not be very accurate. This means they might not always give the correct result. The blood tests often failed to identify people who had vitamin A deficiency (this is called 'low sensitivity'). However, the tests were generally good at correctly identifying people who did not have the deficiency (this is called 'high specificity').\n- The studies we found did not report on any harms from these blood tests. However, the evidence was not high quality, so the results should be interpreted with caution.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that directly compare the accuracy of different blood tests for vitamin A deficiency, including assessing their benefits and potential harms, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and patients.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency and why is it a problem?\nVitamin A deficiency is a serious health condition that occurs when the body does not have enough vitamin A (a vitamin important for good health). Without enough vitamin A, children may not grow properly, the body can't fight infections well, people get sick more often, and it can cause eye problems. In severe cases, it can be fatal for mothers and children.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how accurate certain blood tests are at diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk, especially when the deficiency is not yet causing obvious symptoms. They also looked at why the results might have been different across the studies.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that compared common blood tests for vitamin A deficiency against the most accurate tests available. When the studies were similar, we combined their results to get a more reliable overall picture. We then carefully assessed our confidence in the evidence from these studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 40 studies that involved a total of 385 to 1295 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, without any restriction on age, sex, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, physiological condition, or living location. The studies looked at several common blood tests and compared their results to more accurate 'gold standard' tests. This helps us see how well the common tests perform.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nA major limitation is that none of the studies we found were specifically designed to test the accuracy of these blood tests. The studies also had very small sample sizes, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes, limiting confidence in the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
