  "key_messages": [
    "Blood tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency (a condition where the body lacks enough vitamin A, which is important for growth and immune function) have generally low ability to correctly identify people with the condition, and high ability to correctly identify those without it, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "The available data do not provide clear information on harmful effects of these blood tests, and more research is needed to fully understand their benefits and risks, particularly in different subgroups of people who may be at risk for vitamin A deficiency.",
    "Future studies should focus on designing and conducting high-quality research to determine the accuracy of blood tests for vitamin A deficiency, including assessing their ability to detect the condition in people with different characteristics and needs, to help inform decisions about their use in clinical practice."

      "subheading": "What is vitamin A deficiency and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Vitamin A deficiency is a serious health condition that occurs when the body does not have enough vitamin A. Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining good health, and its deficiency can lead to poor growth, impaired immune responses, increased incidence of disease, ocular impairments, and even maternal and child mortality. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant public health concern, particularly in individuals at risk, such as those with limited access to nutrient-rich foods or with certain medical conditions."

      "subheading": "What are the challenges in diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?",
      "content": "Diagnosing vitamin A deficiency can be challenging. While there are laboratory-based biomarkers available, such as serum or plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein, these tests may not always provide accurate results. Furthermore, the reference standards used to measure vitamin A status, such as retinol isotope dilution and liver vitamin A, may have limitations. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the accuracy of these biomarkers in diagnosing vitamin A deficiency."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine the accuracy of index tests, such as serum or plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein, in diagnosing subclinical vitamin A deficiency in individuals at risk. They also wanted to assess the sources of heterogeneity that may affect the accuracy of these index tests. By evaluating the available evidence, the authors hoped to provide a better understanding of the diagnostic tests used to identify vitamin A deficiency and to inform clinical management and public health decisions."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 40 studies that involved a total of 65 records. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, without any restriction on age, sex, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, physiological condition, or living location. Most studies were cross-sectional or cohort-accuracy studies, with some longitudinal studies and direct, indirect, and random comparison studies. The studies evaluated the accuracy of index tests, including serum or plasma retinol, retinol-binding protein, and relative dose response, against reference standards such as retinol isotope dilution and liver vitamin A. The review found that methods to determine vitamin A deficiency had generally low sensitivity and high specificity in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. It is unclear if these methods have an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete coverage of the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
