  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nWe compared different methods of nutritional support after this surgery, including enteral nutrition (providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract) and parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition). \n\n- Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, with little to no difference in postoperative complications, although the evidence is not very strong.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the jejunum) and oral intake (eating by mouth), shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after this surgery, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. After such a major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following this surgery due to the extent of the operation and the frequency of complications. Therefore, getting the right nutritional support after surgery is so important. It helps improve recovery and allows patients to get back to eating normally.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nThe review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. They compared various methods of nutritional support, including oral intake, enteral feeding (through a tube directly into the intestine), and parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding), to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula (an abnormal connection between the pancreas and other organs), delayed gastric emptying (when the stomach takes too long to empty its contents), and postoperative hemorrhage (bleeding after surgery).\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nThe review found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, with little to no difference in postoperative complications. However, the evidence is not very strong. Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding and oral intake, shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies included different types of patients and used different ways to provide nutrition. This makes it hard to compare their results directly.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While it is factually accurate and complete, it is very difficult for a layperson to read and understand. The language is too academic, with long sentences and complex medical terms that are not clearly explained. The linguistic analysis confirms this, showing significant deviation from typical Plain Language Summary patterns in readability, sentence length, and vocabulary. To improve the summary, please focus on the following three areas:\n\n1. **Simplify Complex Language and Define Jargon Clearly.** The summary uses many medical terms without simple explanations, making it hard to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** 'Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, with little to no difference in postoperative complications, although the evidence is not very strong.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** First, explain the different feeding methods in the background section: 'After surgery, patients can be fed in different ways: through a tube into the intestine (enteral nutrition), through a vein (parenteral nutrition), or by mouth (oral nutrition).' Then, in the results, you can refer to them more simply: 'We found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein.'\n\n2. **Break Down Long Sentences.** The average sentence length is over 25 words, which is too long for a plain language summary. Many sentences combine multiple ideas, making them confusing.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** 'Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the jejunum) and oral intake (eating by mouth), shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.'\n\n3. **Use More Direct, Active Verbs.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'operation' instead of 'operate'), which makes the writing abstract and dense. This is reflected in the very high 'nominalization' score.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** 'Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following this surgery due to the extent of the operation and the frequency of complications.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common.'\n\nBy addressing these key issues, the summary will become much clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with 14 of 18 metrics falling outside the expected range. The readability scores are very low (Flesch Reading Ease: 23.7, BELOW_P10) and grade levels are very high (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 16.2, BEYOND_P90), indicating the text is difficult to read. This is driven by a high average sentence length (25.3 words, P90) and excessive use of complex vocabulary, long words, and nominalizations (all BEYOND_P90)."
