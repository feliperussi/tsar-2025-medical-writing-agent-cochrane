  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nAfter surgery, patients can receive nutrition in three main ways:\n- Enteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into the intestine.\n- Parenteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into a vein (IV).\n- Oral nutrition: eating and drinking by mouth.\n\nWe compared different feeding methods to see which was best at shortening hospital stays and preventing problems after surgery. \n- We found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein.\n- There may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this.\n- We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common. Receiving the right nutrition after surgery is crucial for helping patients recover and survive long-term.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after this surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have. We compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.\n\nWhat methods did we use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after this surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- Patients may have known which treatment they were getting.\n- The studies did not all report on the same health problems.\n- The studies used different feeding methods, which makes them hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after this surgery, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets all critical requirements. The readability scores are excellent, thanks to short sentences and a clear, question-based format. However, a few improvements can make it even more accessible to readers. I am marking this as 'NOT_APPROVED' to ensure these key changes are made.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the 'Aims' section to be more direct and less repetitive.** The language in this section is more complex than the rest of the summary.\n    *   **The issue:** The two sentences in this section are long and use formal phrasing. For example: 'We compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This repeats information from the key messages using more complex words ('nutritional support', 'determine', 'beneficial', 'postoperative complications'). This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of long words and 'nominalizations' (using nouns instead of active verbs).\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Condense this section into a single, clear paragraph. For example: 'We wanted to find out which way of feeding patients after this surgery is best for their recovery. We compared different feeding methods to see which could shorten hospital stays and prevent problems.'\n\n2. **Clarify the different types of tube feeding upfront.** The summary introduces specific feeding methods in the results that aren't explained in the initial definitions.\n    *   **The issue:** The initial list defines 'Enteral nutrition' simply as 'feeding through a tube that goes into the intestine'. Later, the results mention 'feeding through a tube into the intestine' and 'using a tube through the nose' as separate comparisons.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Readers may not understand that a tube through the nose is also a type of enteral nutrition. This could make the comparisons confusing.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Expand the initial definition to cover the methods that will be discussed. For example: '- Enteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This tube can be placed through the nose or directly into the intestine through the skin on the belly.'\n\n3. **Use simpler, everyday words more consistently.** The summary introduces simple terms but sometimes reverts to technical language.\n    *   **The issue:** The text uses the very long, technical term 'pancreaticoduodenectomy' multiple times, even after introducing the simpler 'Whipple procedure'.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Repeatedly using the technical term can be intimidating for readers and makes the text harder to scan.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** After defining it once, primarily use 'Whipple procedure' or 'this surgery' in the rest of the text. For example, instead of 'What is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?', consider 'What is a Whipple procedure (surgery to remove part of the pancreas) and why is nutrition important afterwards?'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Strengths include excellent sentence length (18.8 words/sentence) and high use of active voice. However, the analysis identified two areas for improvement: the number of 'long words' (words with 7+ characters) and 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns) are in the 90th percentile, deviating from typical PLS vocabulary. This suggests that replacing complex vocabulary and using more direct verbs would bring the text more in line with plain language best practices."
