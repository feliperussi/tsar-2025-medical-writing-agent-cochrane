  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nWe compared different methods of nutritional support after this surgery. After surgery, patients can be fed in different ways: through a tube into the intestine (enteral nutrition), through a vein (parenteral nutrition), or by mouth (oral nutrition).\n\n- We found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein.\n- There may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this.\n- We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common. Getting the right nutritional support after surgery is crucial for recovery and long-term survival.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after pancreas surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have. We compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.\n\nWhat methods did we use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nThe review found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. However, the evidence is not very strong. Comparing different methods of nutritional support shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- Patients may have known which treatment they were getting.\n- The studies did not all report on the same health problems.\n- The studies used different feeding methods, which makes them hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are that key technical terms are used before they are defined, and some sentences are dense with complex words and noun-heavy phrases. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier for patients to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define Key Terms Before Using Them:** The key messages at the very top use terms like 'enteral nutrition' and 'parenteral nutrition' (by description), but these are only defined later in the text. This can confuse readers from the start.\n    - **Problematic Section:** The bulleted list at the beginning.\n    - **Suggested Fix:** Move the paragraph that defines the different feeding methods to appear immediately after the main title and before the bulleted key messages. This way, readers understand the core concepts before reading the findings.\n\n2. **Simplify Complex Sentences:** Some sentences contain multiple complex words and noun phrases, making them difficult to process quickly. This is reflected in the evaluation metrics, which show a high number of long words and nominalizations.\n    - **Quote:** \"We compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.\"\n    - **Why it's problematic:** This sentence is packed with multi-syllable words ('various', 'nutritional', 'determine', 'beneficial', 'postoperative', 'complications') that can be simplified.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We compared different feeding methods to see which was best at shortening hospital stays and preventing problems after surgery.\"\n\n3. **Make Definitions Clearer and More Consistent:** The definitions for the feeding methods are brief but could be structured more clearly to help readers link the technical term with the plain language explanation.\n    - **Quote:** \"After surgery, patients can be fed in different ways: through a tube into the intestine (enteral nutrition), through a vein (parenteral nutrition), or by mouth (oral nutrition).\"\n    - **Why it's problematic:** The structure (description first, technical term in brackets) is slightly less intuitive than leading with the term being defined.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"After surgery, patients can receive nutrition in three main ways:\n- **Enteral nutrition:** feeding through a tube that goes into the intestine.\n- **Parenteral nutrition:** feeding through a tube that goes into a vein (IV).\n- **Oral nutrition:** eating and drinking by mouth.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with most readability and structure metrics falling within the best quartile. However, the draft shows significant deviation in three areas: use of noun-forms of verbs (nominalization), density of words with 3+ syllables (smog_index), and use of long words (7+ characters). These metrics support the editorial feedback that the vocabulary and sentence structure could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
