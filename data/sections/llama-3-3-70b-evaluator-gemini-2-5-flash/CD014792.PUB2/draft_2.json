  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas (pancreaticoduodenectomy), and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nWe compared different methods of nutritional support after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including enteral nutrition (providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract) and parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition). \n\n- Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, with little to no difference in postoperative complications, although the evidence is not very strong.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the jejunum) and oral intake (eating by mouth), shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgical operation that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. After such a major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to the extent of the operation and the frequency of complications. Therefore, postoperative nutritional support is vital to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nThe review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. They compared various methods of nutritional support, including oral intake, enteral feeding (through a tube directly into the intestine), and parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding), to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula (an abnormal connection between the pancreas and other organs), delayed gastric emptying (when the stomach takes too long to empty its contents), and postoperative hemorrhage (bleeding after surgery).\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nThe review found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, with little to no difference in postoperative complications. However, the evidence is not very strong. Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding and oral intake, shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It is factually accurate and includes all the required sections. My feedback focuses on making the text easier for patients to read by simplifying the sentence structure and word choices, as the current draft is written at a postgraduate reading level.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Break up long, complex sentences.** Many sentences are over 25 words long and contain multiple complex ideas, making them difficult to follow. Breaking them into shorter sentences will significantly improve clarity.\n    *   **Example:** \"Pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgical operation that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, and other nearby tissues.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This is a single sentence containing a definition, an alternative name, and a list of what is removed. It's too much information to absorb at once.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues.\"\n\n2.  **Replace formal, abstract language with everyday words.** The draft uses many formal terms and abstract nouns (nominalizations) where simpler verbs and descriptions would be clearer for readers.\n    *   **Example:** \"Therefore, postoperative nutritional support is vital to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\"\n    *   **Problem:** Phrases like \"postoperative nutritional support,\" \"optimize outcomes,\" and \"resume a normal diet\" are clinical and abstract.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"This is why getting the right nutritional support after surgery is so important. It helps improve recovery and allows patients to get back to eating normally.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify technical descriptions in the 'Limitations' section.** The explanation of the evidence limitations uses terms that are unfamiliar to most people.\n    *   **Example:** \"...the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\"\n    *   **Problem:** \"Heterogeneous populations\" and \"reducing comparability\" are research jargon.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"...the studies included different types of patients and used different ways to provide nutrition. This makes it hard to compare their results directly.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much more accessible and useful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics falling in the 'Beyond P90' or 'Below P10' range. The most critical issues are an extremely high average sentence length (28.4 words), a postgraduate reading level (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 18.4), and excessive use of complex words and nominalizations. These scores indicate the text is likely too difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
