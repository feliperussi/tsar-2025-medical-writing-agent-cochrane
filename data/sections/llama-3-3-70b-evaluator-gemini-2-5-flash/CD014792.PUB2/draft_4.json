  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nWe compared different methods of nutritional support after this surgery. After surgery, patients can be fed in different ways: through a tube into the intestine (enteral nutrition), through a vein (parenteral nutrition), or by mouth (oral nutrition). \n\n- We found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. \n- There may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this.\n- We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common. Getting the right nutritional support after surgery is crucial for recovery and long-term survival.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nThe review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. They compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nThe review found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. However, the evidence is not very strong. Comparing different methods of nutritional support shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies included different types of patients and used different ways to provide nutrition. This makes it hard to compare their results directly.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and reduce complexity for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify formal, noun-heavy language.** Some sentences are dense and use complex terminology where simpler phrasing would be clearer. This is reflected in the high scores for nominalization and complex words.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is very formal and uses noun phrases like \"assessment of the effects\" and \"nutritional support strategies,\" which are hard to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after pancreas surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have.\"\n\n2. **Use a consistent point of view.** The text switches between the first person (\"We found\") and the third person (\"The review authors\"), which can be confusing. The style guide requires using \"we\" consistently.\n   - **Original subheading:** \"What did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It creates an inconsistent, impersonal tone.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Change the subheading to \"What did we aim to find out?\" and rewrite the section to use \"we\" throughout (as in the example above).\n\n3. **Break up long, complex sentences.** The limitations section contains a single 46-word sentence listing multiple distinct reasons, which is overwhelming for the reader.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies included different types of patients and used different ways to provide nutrition.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This \"wall of text\" makes it difficult for readers to absorb each important limitation.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Use a bulleted list to make the information easier to scan and understand:\n   \"The evidence is limited for several reasons:\n   - The studies were very small.\n   - Patients may have known which treatment they were getting.\n   - The studies did not all report on the same health problems.\n   - The studies used different feeding methods, which makes them hard to compare.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity overall, with half of the metrics falling into the best quartile for readability. However, four key metrics deviate significantly from typical PLS patterns, indicating issues with vocabulary complexity. The scores for nominalization (noun-form verbs), SMOG index (readability), complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters) are all in the highest 10th percentile, suggesting the text is denser and uses more complex language than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
