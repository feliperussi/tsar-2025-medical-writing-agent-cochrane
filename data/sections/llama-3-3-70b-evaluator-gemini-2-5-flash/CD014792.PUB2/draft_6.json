  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nAfter surgery, patients can receive nutrition in three main ways:\n- Enteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into the intestine.\n- Parenteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into a vein (IV).\n- Oral nutrition: eating and drinking by mouth.\n\nWe compared different feeding methods to see which was best at shortening hospital stays and preventing problems after surgery. \n- We found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein.\n- There may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this.\n- We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common. Getting the right nutritional support after surgery is crucial for recovery and long-term survival.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after pancreas surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have. We compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.\n\nWhat methods did we use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nThe review found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. However, the evidence is not very strong. Comparing different methods of nutritional support shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- Patients may have known which treatment they were getting.\n- The studies did not all report on the same health problems.\n- The studies used different feeding methods, which makes them hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. However, there are a few key areas for improvement that will make it even more accessible to readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\\n\\n1. **Replace the technical term 'pancreaticoduodenectomy' after its initial definition.**\\n   - **Issue:** The long, technical term 'pancreaticoduodenectomy' is used multiple times throughout the text, even after being defined. This can be intimidating for readers and makes sentences harder to process.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy...\\\"\\n   - **Suggestion:** After defining the term initially, use simpler phrases like \\\"this surgery\\\" or \\\"this operation\\\" in the rest of the text. For example: \\\"Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after this surgery...\\\"\\n\\n2. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).**\\n   - **Issue:** Some sentences rely on noun forms of verbs, which can make them feel abstract and less direct. This is reflected in the high nominalization score.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"Getting the right nutritional support after surgery is crucial for recovery and long-term survival.\\\"\\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase using a more direct verb. For example: \\\"Receiving the right nutrition after surgery is crucial for helping patients recover and survive long-term.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Increase conciseness by removing redundant sections.**\\n   - **Issue:** The section \\\"What are the main findings of the review?\\\" repeats the key findings that are already presented clearly and concisely in the bulleted list at the very beginning of the summary.\\n   - **Example:** The entire paragraph under \\\"What are the main findings of the review?\\\" restates the initial key messages.\\n   - **Suggestion:** Consider removing the \\\"What are the main findings of the review?\\\" section entirely. The initial key messages are excellent and do the job effectively, and removing this repetition will make the summary more direct and easier to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also highlights three metrics that deviate from the typical range: nominalization (P90), SMOG index (P90), and long words (P90). These deviations support the editorial feedback, indicating that the text could be improved by using more direct verbs instead of noun phrases and by simplifying or replacing long, complex words like 'pancreaticoduodenectomy' to enhance clarity for a lay audience."
