  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nKey messages:\n- Enteral nutrition (a way of providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract) by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine, through which nutrients can be delivered) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition, where nutrients are delivered through a vein), with little to no difference in postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery), although the evidence is not very strong.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the jejunum) and oral intake (eating by mouth), shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy (a surgical procedure to remove part of the pancreas), including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgical operation that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. After such a major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition (a condition that results from eating a diet in which one or more nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems) is a significant risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to the extent of the operation and the frequency of complications. Therefore, postoperative nutritional support is vital to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after this surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have. We compared various methods of nutritional support, including oral intake (eating by mouth), enteral feeding (through a tube directly into the intestine), and parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding, where nutrients are delivered through a vein), to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula (leakage from the reconnected pancreas), delayed gastric emptying (when the stomach takes too long to empty), and postoperative hemorrhage (bleeding after the operation).\n\nWhat methods of nutritional support are available after pancreaticoduodenectomy?\n- Enteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This tube can be placed through the nose or directly into the intestine through the skin on the belly.\n- Parenteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into a vein (IV).\n- Oral nutrition: eating and drinking by mouth.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nOur main finding is that feeding through a tube directly into the intestine likely shortens the hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. This is based on moderate-certainty evidence, meaning we are reasonably confident in this result. We also found that there may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this. We compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias from lack of blinding), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and healthcare providers?\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence. This will help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions about postoperative nutritional support.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is not approved. It has one critical issue and several major clarity problems that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n*   **Missing 'Methods' Section:** The summary does not explain how the review was conducted. Please add a section with the heading 'How did we conduct this review?' and include this content from the source material: 'We searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Break up overly long sentences.** Many sentences are too long and contain multiple ideas and definitions, making them hard to follow. The average sentence length is nearly 30 words, which is too high for a plain language summary.\n    *   **Example:** 'Enteral nutrition (a way of providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract) by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine, through which nutrients can be delivered) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition, where nutrients are delivered through a vein), with little to no difference in postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery), although the evidence is not very strong.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this as several short sentences. For example: 'We looked at two ways to feed patients. 'Enteral nutrition' provides food through a tube into the gut. 'Parenteral nutrition' provides food through a tube in a vein (an IV). We found that enteral nutrition likely shortens the hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition. There was little to no difference in the problems patients had after surgery.'\n\n2.  **Simplify complex language and define terms clearly.** The text uses many technical terms and long words, making it hard to read. The analysis shows a very high number of complex and long words, resulting in a reading grade level of nearly 17.\n    *   **Example:** 'Malnutrition (a condition that results from eating a diet in which one or more nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems) is a significant risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Simplify the definition and use the simpler term for the surgery. For example: 'After this surgery, it can be hard for patients to get enough nutrition. This is called malnutrition, and it can slow down recovery. It is a common risk because the operation is so large.'\n\n3.  **Use more active verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).** The writing is very noun-heavy, which makes it sound abstract and academic. The analysis identified a high number of nominalizations, which are noun forms of verbs.\n    *   **Example:** 'Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy... and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase with more direct verbs. For example: 'We need more high-quality studies to know for sure how to best feed patients after this surgery. This will help doctors and patients decide which methods are safest and work best.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. 11 out of 18 metrics (61%) are in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, indicating extreme deviation. Key problem areas are sentence length (words_per_sentence = 29.9), vocabulary complexity (complex_words = 168), and use of abstract nouns (nominalization = 30). Consequently, all readability scores, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (16.8), are far above the target range for a lay audience, making the text very difficult to read."
