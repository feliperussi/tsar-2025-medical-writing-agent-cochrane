  "key_messages": [
    "Enteral nutrition (a way of providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract) by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine, through which nutrients can be delivered) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition, where nutrients are delivered through a vein), with little to no difference in postoperative complications (problems that occur after surgery), although the evidence is not very strong.",
    "Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the jejunum) and oral intake (eating by mouth), shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or postoperative complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain and often based on few studies.",
    "Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy (a surgical procedure to remove part of the pancreas), including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence."

      "subheading": "What is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?",
      "content": "Pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgical operation that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. After such a major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to the extent of the operation and the frequency of complications. Therefore, postoperative nutritional support is vital to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?",
      "content": "The review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. They compared various methods of nutritional support, including oral intake, enteral feeding (through a tube directly into the intestine), and parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding), to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, and postoperative hemorrhage."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias from lack of blinding), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.",
