  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nAfter surgery, patients can receive nutrition in three main ways:\n- Enteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This tube can be placed through the nose or directly into the intestine through the skin on the belly.\n- Parenteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into a vein (IV).\n- Oral nutrition: eating and drinking by mouth.\n\nWe wanted to find out which way of feeding patients after this surgery is best for their recovery. We compared different feeding methods to see which could shorten hospital stays and prevent problems.\n\nWe found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. There may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this. We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure (surgery to remove part of the pancreas) and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA Whipple procedure is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common. Receiving the right nutrition after surgery is crucial for helping patients recover and survive long-term.\n\nWe compared different feeding methods to see which could shorten hospital stays and prevent problems. We searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after this surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- Patients may have known which treatment they were getting.\n- The studies did not all report on the same health problems.\n- The studies used different feeding methods, which makes them hard to compare.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after this surgery, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.",

However, these positive metrics do not capture the significant structural and organizational issues that negatively impact the overall clarity and reader experience."
