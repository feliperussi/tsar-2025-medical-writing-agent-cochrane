  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and how do different methods compare in helping patients recover?\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgical operation that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. After such a major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy due to the extent of the operation and the frequency of complications. Therefore, postoperative nutritional support is vital to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nThe review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. They compared various methods of nutritional support, including oral intake, enteral feeding (through a tube directly into the intestine), and parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding), to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, and postoperative hemorrhage.\n\nWhat methods of nutritional support are available after pancreaticoduodenectomy?\n- Enteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This tube can be placed through the nose or directly into the intestine through the skin on the belly.\n- Parenteral nutrition: feeding through a tube that goes into a vein (IV).\n- Oral nutrition: eating and drinking by mouth.\n\nWhat are the main findings of the review?\nWe found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. There may be little to no difference in problems after surgery between these two methods, but we are not very sure about this. We also compared other feeding methods, like using a tube through the nose or having patients eat by mouth. We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias from lack of blinding), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and healthcare providers?\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence. This will help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions about postoperative nutritional support.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It has a critical structural issue and several areas where clarity can be significantly improved for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\n*   **Missing Key Messages Section:** The draft is missing the 'Key Messages' section, which is a mandatory component of a Cochrane Plain Language Summary. This section should summarize the main findings in a few bullet points at the beginning.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Define Technical Medical Terms:** The text uses several medical terms without explanation, which will be unfamiliar to most readers.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"...postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, and postoperative hemorrhage.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Readers won't understand what these specific complications are, reducing the impact of the findings.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...problems after surgery, such as pancreatic fistula (leakage from the reconnected pancreas), delayed gastric emptying (when the stomach takes too long to empty), and postoperative hemorrhage (bleeding after the operation).\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Complex Sentences:** Some sentences are long and packed with technical concepts, making them difficult to process.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The review authors sought to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence contains multiple complex ideas and is written in a formal, academic style.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after this surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify the Main Finding and Certainty of Evidence:** The summary of the main finding is vague and downplays the result.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"We found that feeding through a tube into the intestine likely leads to a shorter hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. ...but we are not very sure about this.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"we are not very sure\" is imprecise. The original abstract states this finding is based on 'moderate-certainty evidence', which is an important detail. Using clear, simple terms to explain evidence certainty is crucial.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our main finding is that feeding through a tube directly into the intestine likely shortens the hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein. This is based on moderate-certainty evidence, meaning we are reasonably confident in this result.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour own editorial instincts about the text's complexity are confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very low Flesch Reading Ease score (32.58) and high scores for complex and long words, placing it in the most difficult-to-read percentile for PLS texts. Addressing the issues above will help improve these scores and, more importantly, make the summary much clearer for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, there is a significant deviation in readability and vocabulary complexity. Seven key metrics, including Flesch Reading Ease (P10), SMOG Index (P90), complex words (P90), and long words (P90), fall outside the typical range. This pattern indicates that the draft's vocabulary is more technical and its sentences are harder to read than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need for simplification and clearer definitions."
