  "plain_title": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix may not prevent infection or other complications, and the evidence is very uncertain about its benefits and harms, including the risk of mortality (death) and longer hospital stays, with mortality referring to death as a result of the treatment or condition.",
    "The current evidence does not support the use of abdominal drainage as a standard practice for preventing complications after appendectomy (surgical removal of the appendix) for complicated appendicitis, a condition where the appendix is gangrenous or perforated, leading to a potentially life‑threatening infection.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting larger, well‑designed studies to determine the effects of abdominal drainage on outcomes such as mortality, infection, and hospital stay, and to address the uncertainties and limitations of the current evidence, ultimately aiming to provide clearer guidance for clinical practice and improve patient care."

      "subheading": "What is complicated appendicitis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Complicated appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous or perforated, leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, people who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications, such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, and morbidity."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. They also aimed to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal. Additionally, they sought to determine whether abdominal drainage can prevent intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compare the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal. This Cochrane review was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, Medical Research Projects of Chongqing, and the Kuanren Talents Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."

      "subheading": "Main results: Abdominal drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis",
      "content": "The use of abdominal drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis may increase the risk of mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023."
