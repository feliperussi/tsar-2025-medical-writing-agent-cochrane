  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Using a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days.\n- It is very uncertain if drains prevent other problems, like infections, or shorten hospital stays.\n- Based on current evidence, routine use of a drain is not supported after surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nComplicated appendicitis is when the appendix gets infected and becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears). This can lead to a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, after surgery for complicated appendicitis, people are more likely to have problems, such as an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen or an infection in the surgical cut.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a drain in the abdomen helps or harms people after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent pockets of pus (abscesses), wound infections, or other health problems for people having either keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery or open surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis, which can cause a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis. All participants received courses of antibiotics after keyhole or open surgery. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies?\nUsing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. The evidence for this is of moderate certainty. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or other health problems. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different groups of people (both children and adults). Also, the surgeries were performed in different ways (some were open surgery, others were keyhole surgery), which makes the results hard to combine.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023. We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the effects of drains on death, infection, and hospital stays. This would provide clearer guidance for doctors and improve patient care.",

The following suggestions are minor but will help improve consistency and readability for your audience.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Use Consistent Language for Evidence Certainty**\n\nYou use different phrases to describe the same level of evidence, which could be confusing. Sticking to one phrase improves clarity.\n\n- **Quote 1 (from Key Messages):** \"It is **very uncertain** if drains prevent other problems...\"\n- **Quote 2 (from Main Results):** \"It is **unclear** if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess...\"\n- **Suggestion:** Use the same wording in both places. We recommend using \"very uncertain\" as it directly reflects the GRADE rating for very low-certainty evidence.\n  - **Rewrite (for Main Results):** \"The evidence is **very uncertain** whether using a drain affects the risk of abscesses, wound infections, or other health problems.\"\n\n**2. Remove Redundant Definitions**\n\nThe term \"peritonitis\" is defined twice. Removing the second definition makes the text more concise.\n\n- **Quote (from 'What did we find?'):** \"The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis, which can cause a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis.\"\n- **Problem:** This was already clearly defined in the \"What is complicated appendicitis?\" section.\n- **Suggestion:** Since the term has already been explained, you can refer to it more simply.\n  - **Rewrite:** \"Most people in the studies had a perforated appendix, which can cause peritonitis.\"\n\n**3. Use Active Voice for Clearer Sentences**\n\nOne sentence in the limitations section uses passive voice, which can make it less direct. Switching to active voice makes it clearer who is performing the action.\n\n- **Quote:** \"Also, the surgeries **were performed** in different ways...\"\n- **Problem:** This is a passive construction. It's clearer to state that the surgeons performed the surgeries.\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase the sentence in the active voice.\n  - **Rewrite:** \"Also, surgeons **used** different (some open, some keyhole), which makes it difficult to combine the results.\"\n\nBy making these small changes, you can make an already good summary even better. Great work.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.08) and Dale-Chall (7.14) are excellent. The only minor deviation is a slightly high SMOG index (13.63), likely due to necessary medical terms like 'peritonitis' and 'appendectomy' which have been appropriately defined for the reader. The draft also shows strong use of active voice and personal pronouns, aligning well with plain language principles."
