  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications? We revised the draft based on the evaluator feedback to improve clarity for a lay audience.\n\nKey messages:\n- Using a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days.\n- It is very uncertain if drains prevent other problems, like infections, or shorten hospital stays.\n- Based on current evidence, routine use of a drain is not supported after surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nComplicated appendicitis is when the appendix gets infected and becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears). This can lead to a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, after surgery for complicated appendicitis, people are more likely to have problems, such as an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen or an infection in the surgical cut.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a drain in the abdomen helps or harms people after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent pockets of pus (abscesses), wound infections, or other health problems for people having either keyhole or open surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis, which can cause a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies?\nUsing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. The evidence for this is of moderate certainty. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different groups of people (both children and adults). Also, the surgeries were performed in different ways (some were open surgery, others were keyhole surgery), which makes the results hard to combine.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023. We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the effects of drains on death, infection, and hospital stays. This would provide clearer guidance for doctors and improve patient care.",

The summary should start with the title question.\n\n2. **Define Technical Terms:** The summary uses the clinical term \"morbidity\" without explaining what it means to a lay reader.\n   - **QUOTE:** \"It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Replace \"morbidity\" with a simpler, more descriptive phrase. For example: \"...or other health problems.\" or \"...or other complications.\"\n\n3. **Use Consistent, Simple Terminology:** The text uses two different terms for the same type of surgery, which can be confusing. It's best to choose the simpler term and use it consistently.\n   - **QUOTE:** The text mentions \"laparoscopic appendectomy\" in one section and \"keyhole surgery\" in another.\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Replace \"laparoscopic appendectomy\" with \"keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery\" on first use, and then just use \"keyhole surgery\" thereafter.\n\n4. **Simplify Clinical Phrasing:** A minor phrase could be simplified to sound more like everyday language.\n   - **QUOTE:** \"All participants received antibiotic regimens...\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Change this to \"All participants were treated with antibiotics...\" or \"All participants received courses of antibiotics...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS TO TYPICAL PLS PATTERNS, with 15 of 18 metrics (83.3%) falling within the best quartile for readability and style. The draft meets the word count limit and has excellent sentence length and use of active voice. The only significant deviation is the SMOG index (13.8), which is in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual density of words with three or more syllables. This suggests that targeting a few complex terms for simplification, as noted in the feedback, would be the most effective way to enhance readability."
