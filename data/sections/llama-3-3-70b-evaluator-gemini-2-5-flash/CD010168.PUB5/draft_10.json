  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Using a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days.\n- The evidence is very uncertain if drains prevent other problems, like infections, or shorten hospital stays.\n- Based on current evidence, routine use of a drain is not supported after surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nComplicated appendicitis is when the appendix gets infected and becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears). This can lead to a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, after surgery for complicated appendicitis, people are more likely to have problems, such as an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen or an infection in the surgical cut.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a drain in the abdomen helps or harms people after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent pockets of pus (abscesses), wound infections, or other health problems for people having either keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery or open surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. Most people in the studies had a perforated appendix, which can cause peritonitis. All participants received courses of antibiotics after keyhole or open surgery. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies?\nUsing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. The evidence for this is of moderate certainty. The evidence is very uncertain whether using a drain affects the risk of abscesses, wound infections, or other health problems. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different groups of people (both children and adults). Also, surgeons used different methods (some open, some keyhole), which makes the results hard to combine.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023. We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the effects of drains on death, infection, and hospital stays. This would provide clearer guidance for doctors and improve patient care.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is well-written and easy to understand. The metrics confirm its high quality. However, a few small but important revisions are needed to improve clarity and accuracy before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Clarify the key message about hospital stays.** The second key message is confusing because it contradicts the findings presented later in the summary.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- The evidence is very uncertain if drains prevent other problems, like infections, or shorten hospital stays.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This suggests uncertainty about *shortening* stays, but the main results state that drains \"may *increase* hospital stay.\" This contradiction could confuse readers about the potential harms.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- The evidence is very uncertain whether drains prevent other problems like infections. Drains may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but this evidence is also very uncertain.\"\n\n2. **Shorten a long sentence in the 'Aims' section.** One sentence is quite long and could be split up to make it easier to read.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent pockets of pus (abscesses), wound infections, or other health problems for people having either keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery or open surgery for complicated appendicitis.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 37 words, this sentence combines several ideas. Breaking it into two shorter sentences will improve readability.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent abscesses, wound infections, or other health problems. We looked at this for people having either keyhole (laparoscopic) or open surgery.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the phrasing about the study comparisons.** The sentence describing what the studies compared is a bit repetitive and could be streamlined.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The structure is slightly clunky. Rephrasing can make the point more directly and clearly.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies we found only compared using a drain versus not using one. No studies looked at different types of drains or different timings for removing them.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. For example, the average sentence length (16.21 words) and low use of passive voice (8 instances) are excellent. All metrics are within the typical ranges, indicating a strong stylistic foundation that needs only minor content adjustments."
