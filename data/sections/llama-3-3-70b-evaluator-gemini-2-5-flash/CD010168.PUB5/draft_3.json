  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if using a drain in the abdomen after surgery for an infected appendix can help prevent infection and other complications. \n\n- Using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. In the studies, there were seven deaths in the group that used a drain, compared to one death in the group that did not.\n- The current evidence does not support using a drain as a standard practice for preventing problems after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis. \n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies to determine the effects of abdominal drainage on outcomes such as death, infection, and hospital stay.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why is it a problem?\nComplicated appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears), leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis, people are more likely to have problems. These can include an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen, an infection in the surgical cut, or other health issues.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess (a collection of pus in the abdominal cavity) after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. They also aimed to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal. Additionally, they sought to determine whether abdominal drainage can prevent intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity (disease) in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity). All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies?\nUsing a drain after surgery probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies comparing abdominal drainage versus no drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. Thank you for your work on it. To make it even clearer for a lay audience, I have 3 main suggestions focused on simplifying the language and improving clarity.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Sentences and Reduce Technical Terms**\n\nSome sentences are long and contain multiple technical terms, which can be difficult for readers to process all at once. Breaking these down will significantly improve readability.\n\n- **Quote:** \"The review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess (a collection of pus in the abdominal cavity) after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\"\n- **Problem:** This single sentence contains five distinct technical concepts. It's grammatically correct but very dense for a non-medical reader.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if using a drain in the abdomen helps or harms people after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis. Specifically, we looked at whether it could prevent a collection of pus (an abscess) from forming inside the abdomen.\"\n\n**2. Clarify the Key Message on Mortality**\n\nThe first key message is direct but lacks context for the numbers, which could be alarming without it. Adding the total number of participants helps readers understand the scale.\n\n- **Quote:** \"In the studies, there were seven deaths in the group that used a drain, compared to one death in the group that did not.\"\n- **Problem:** Readers don't know if this was out of 10 people or 1000. Providing the denominator makes the finding easier to interpret.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In the studies, out of about 600 people, there were seven deaths in the group that used a drain and one death in the group that did not.\"\n\n**3. Use Consistent, Simpler Terminology**\n\nThe summary uses several different terms for the main condition (e.g., \"infected appendix,\" \"severe case of appendicitis,\" \"complicated appendicitis\"). It's best to define the technical term once and then use the simpler phrase consistently.\n\n- **Quote:** The text alternates between \"infected appendix,\" \"severe case of appendicitis,\" and \"complicated appendicitis.\"\n- **Problem:** This may confuse readers, who might not realize these terms all refer to the same condition.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** In the section \"What is complicated appendicitis...?\", after defining the condition, add: \"Throughout this summary, we will call this 'a severe case of appendicitis'.\" Then, use this simpler phrase in the rest of the text for consistency.\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\n\nMy suggestions are supported by the evaluation metrics, which show that the vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The **SMOG index** (which measures complexity based on multi-syllable words) is unusually high, and the counts for **complex words**, **long words**, and **nominalizations** (noun-heavy phrases) are all in the 90th percentile. The changes suggested above will help address these underlying statistical patterns and make the text more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and active voice are good, the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Metrics like the SMOG index, complex words, long words, and nominalizations are all in the 90th percentile or beyond, indicating the language is much more technical and noun-heavy than a typical PLS. This suggests a need to simplify word choices and sentence structures to improve readability for a lay audience."
