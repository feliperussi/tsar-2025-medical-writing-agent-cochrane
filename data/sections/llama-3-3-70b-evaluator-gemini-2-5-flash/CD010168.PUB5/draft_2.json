  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if using a drain in the abdomen after surgery for an infected appendix can help prevent infection and other complications. \n\n- Using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix may not prevent infection or other complications. The evidence is very uncertain about its benefits and harms, including the risk of death and longer hospital stays.\n- The current evidence does not support the use of abdominal drainage as a standard practice for preventing complications after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. \n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies to determine the effects of abdominal drainage on outcomes such as death, infection, and hospital stay.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why is it a problem?\nComplicated appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears), leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, people who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications, such as intraperitoneal abscess (a collection of pus in the abdominal cavity), wound infection, and morbidity (disease).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. They also aimed to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal. Additionally, they sought to determine whether abdominal drainage can prevent intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity). All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies?\nThe use of abdominal drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis may increase the risk of death, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It has two critical issues: 1) It is missing the required 'Methods' section, which explains how the review was conducted. 2) It inaccurately reports the review's findings on mortality, stating the evidence is 'very uncertain' when the source abstract describes it as 'moderate-certainty' that drains 'probably increase the risk of death'. This misrepresents a key finding.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to make this summary clear and accurate for patients:\n\n1. **Accurately state the finding on risk of death.** The current text downplays a significant safety concern. This must be corrected to reflect the source material.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The use of abdominal drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis may increase the risk of death, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Using a drain after surgery probably increases the risk of death within 30 days (based on moderate-certainty evidence). In the studies, there were seven deaths in the group that used a drain, compared to one death in the group that did not.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex medical language and sentence structure.** The text is difficult for a lay audience to read due to long sentences packed with technical terms.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"However, people who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications, such as intraperitoneal abscess (a collection of pus in the abdominal cavity), wound infection, and morbidity (disease).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis, people are more likely to have problems. These can include an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen, an infection in the surgical cut, or other health issues.\"\n\n3. **Make the key messages easier to understand on their own.** The key messages use technical terms like 'appendectomy' and 'complicated appendicitis' without the definitions that appear later in the text. These should be included directly in the key messages.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The current evidence does not support the use of abdominal drainage as a standard practice for preventing complications after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The current evidence does not support using a drain as a standard practice for preventing problems after surgery (appendectomy) for a severe case of appendicitis (when the appendix is burst or dying).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While some structural metrics like sentence length (19 words) and active voice use are good, several critical readability scores indicate the text is too complex for a general audience. The SMOG index and complex word count are in the 'BEYOND_P90' range, and the Flesch Reading Ease score is very low ('P10'). This is supported by high counts for long words and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. These metrics confirm that the vocabulary is too technical and sentences are too dense, making the summary difficult to understand."
