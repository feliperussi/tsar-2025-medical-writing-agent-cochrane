  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove a severe case of appendicitis help prevent infection and other complications? \n\nKey messages\n- Using a drain after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days.\n- It is very uncertain if drains prevent other problems, like infections, or shorten hospital stays.\n- Based on current evidence, routine use of a drain is not supported after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis.\n\nWhat is a severe case of appendicitis and why is it a problem? \nA severe case of appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears), leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, people who undergo appendectomy for a severe case of appendicitis are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications, such as an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen, an infection in the surgical cut, or other health issues.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if using a drain in the abdomen helps or harms people after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis. We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent pockets of pus (abscesses), wound infections, or other health problems for people having either keyhole or open surgery for a severe case of appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with a severe case of appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity). All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies? \nUsing a drain after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. The evidence for this is of moderate certainty. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.\n\nFuture research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies to determine the effects of abdominal drainage on outcomes such as death, infection, and hospital stay, and to address the uncertainties and limitations of the current evidence, ultimately aiming to provide clearer guidance for clinical practice and improve patient care.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain complex terms more simply.** The definition for peritonitis is clinical and placed in parentheses, which can be easy for readers to skip. This term is important for understanding why the condition is serious.\n    - **Current text:** \"...perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity).\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...perforated appendicitis, which can cause a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen called peritonitis.\"\n\n2. **Make the limitations more specific.** The explanation of the evidence limitations is vague. Using concrete examples helps readers understand *why* the evidence is weak.\n    - **Current text:** \"...the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different groups of people (both children and adults). Also, the surgeries were performed in different ways (some were open surgery, others were keyhole surgery), which makes the results hard to combine.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the final paragraph.** The concluding sentence is very long (49 words) and contains wordy, formal phrases. Breaking it up and using more direct language will make the key message about future research clearer.\n    - **Current text:** \"Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies to determine the effects of abdominal drainage on outcomes such as death, infection, and hospital stay, and to address the uncertainties and limitations of the current evidence, ultimately aiming to provide clearer guidance for clinical practice and improve patient care.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the effects of drains on death, infection, and hospital stays. This would provide clearer guidance for doctors and improve patient care.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (67%) falling into the best quartile for readability. The average sentence length is excellent (19.25 words). The only significant deviation is the SMOG index (a measure of complex words), which is in the P90 range. This is likely due to necessary medical terms like 'appendicitis' and 'laparoscopic'. The suggested edits, particularly simplifying the final paragraph, will help address this by reducing word complexity and improving overall clarity."
