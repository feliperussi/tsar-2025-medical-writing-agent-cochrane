  "draft": "Can using a drain in the abdomen after surgery to remove an infected appendix help prevent infection and other complications? We found that using a drain after surgery for an infected appendix may increase the risk of death within 30 days, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. The current evidence does not support using a drain as a standard practice for preventing problems after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis. Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies to determine the effects of abdominal drainage on outcomes such as death, infection, and hospital stay.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why is it a problem? Complicated appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous (dies due to lack of blood supply) or perforated (tears), leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. We will call this condition 'a severe case of appendicitis' throughout this summary. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis, people are more likely to have problems, such as an abscess (a pocket of pus) inside the abdomen, an infection in the surgical cut, or other health issues.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to find out if using a drain in the abdomen helps or harms people after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis. We also wanted to know if using a drain could prevent pockets of pus (abscesses), wound infections, or other health problems for people having either keyhole or open surgery for a severe case of appendicitis.\n\nWhat did we find? We found 8 studies that involved 739 people with a severe case of appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity). All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results of the studies? Using a drain after surgery for an infected appendix may increase the risk of death within 30 days, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved due to a critical factual error that misrepresents the review's main finding on patient harm. There are also several clarity issues that need to be addressed.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Correct the Certainty of Evidence for Mortality:** The draft incorrectly states that the evidence for an increased risk of death is 'very uncertain'. The original abstract clearly states this is a 'moderate-certainty' finding, which is a significant difference for a patient trying to understand the risks.\n    *   **Problem Text:** \"Using a drain after surgery for an infected appendix may increase the risk of death within 30 days, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Using a drain after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis **probably increases the risk of death** within 30 days. The evidence for this is of moderate certainty.\"\n\n2.  **Use Consistent Terminology for the Condition:** The summary defines 'complicated appendicitis' as 'a severe case of appendicitis' but then frequently uses the term 'infected appendix'. This inconsistency could confuse readers.\n    *   **Problem Text:** \"We will call this condition 'a severe case of appendicitis' throughout this summary.\" ... but then later ... \"Using a drain after surgery for an **infected appendix**...\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Replace all instances of \"infected appendix\" with \"a severe case of appendicitis\" to maintain consistency. For example: \"Using a drain after surgery for **a severe case of appendicitis** probably increases the risk of death...\"\n\n3.  **Strengthen and Clarify the Key Messages:** The opening paragraph combines the title, findings, and conclusions in a way that weakens the impact. The structure should be clearer to help readers grasp the main takeaways immediately.\n    *   **Problem Text:** The entire first paragraph is a mix of the title and a narrative summary.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Start with a clear **\"Key messages\"** heading and use bullet points to list the main findings, as this is easier for readers to scan and understand. For example:\n        \"**Key messages**\n        - Using a drain after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis probably increases the risk of death within 30 days.\n        - It is very uncertain if drains prevent other problems, like infections, or shorten hospital stays.\n        - Based on current evidence, routine use of a drain is not supported after surgery for a severe case of appendicitis.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly conformant with typical PLS patterns. An impressive 77.8% of metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and style, including excellent sentence length (18.5 words/sentence) and strong use of active voice. However, these strong structural metrics do not capture the critical factual inaccuracy and logical inconsistencies identified in the editorial review. This highlights that while the text is structurally simple, its core message is flawed."
