  "key_messages": [
    "Single-incision sling operations (a minimally-invasive surgical procedure using a synthetic device to support the urethra) may be as effective as other surgical methods, such as retropubic slings and transobturator slings, for treating stress urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine, often during physical activity, due to weakened urethral support) in women, with similar rates of subjective cure or improvement of incontinence at 12 months.",
    "The evidence suggests that single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings, but there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects), such as mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion, and longer-term outcomes.",
    "Future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings, addressing key limitations and important unanswered questions, such as the potential benefits and harms of these procedures in different subgroups of women with stress urinary incontinence."

      "subheading": "What is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Stress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments for stress urinary incontinence include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the mid-urethra."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations. They aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings, and to identify any uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other types of slings, such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. Most studies lasted for around 12 months. The population characteristics were not explicitly stated, but all participants were women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions compared were different types of sling operations, and there were no studies comparing single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures. Overall, the included studies provided a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness and safety of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women."

      "subheading": "Main results: Treatment effectiveness and safety",
      "content": "Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. It is uncertain if single-incision slings lead to better or worse rates of subjective cure or improvement compared with autologous fascial slings. Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings. The effect of single-incision slings on the risk of dyspareunia is uncertain compared with transobturator slings."
