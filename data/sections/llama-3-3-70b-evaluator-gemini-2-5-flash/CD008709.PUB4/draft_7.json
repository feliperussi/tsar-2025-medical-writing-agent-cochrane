  "draft": "Are single-incision sling operations as effective as other types of sling operations for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking urine when you cough, sneeze, or exercise) in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings (placed through a cut in the abdomen) and are as effective as transobturator slings (placed through a cut in the thigh) for treating stress urinary incontinence. We are uncertain how they compare with autologous fascial slings (made from a woman's own body tissue), which are a type of sling made from the patient's own tissue.\n- The use of single-incision slings probably reduces the risk of patient-reported pain after surgery compared to transobturator slings.\n- The review authors concluded that future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings (the group of surgeries that includes retropubic and transobturator slings).\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. This condition can have a major impact on a person's health, well-being, and finances. Common treatments include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women. We summarized and combined their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other treatments such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to other sling types, we found:\n- Transobturator slings: Single-incision slings are just as effective at improving incontinence. They probably cause less long-term pain after surgery. The risk of the mesh material causing complications (like wearing away or showing through the vaginal wall) was similar for both types.\n- Retropubic slings: Single-incision slings may be as effective at improving incontinence, but we are less certain. We are also uncertain about the risk of mesh complications or other complications.\n- Autologous fascial slings: We did not find enough evidence to compare them with single-incision slings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and limited coverage of the relevant populations and outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 20 September 2022.",

However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity and align with style guidelines before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use a consistent point of view.** The style guide requires using 'we' to refer to the review authors, but the draft sometimes switches to the third person. This can be confusing for the reader.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The review authors concluded that future research should focus on...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** It creates an inconsistent voice, making the summary feel less direct and personal.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We concluded that future research should focus on...\"\n\n2. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences rely on complex noun phrases (nominalizations) instead of direct verbs, making them harder to understand. This is supported by the high nominalization count in the evaluation results.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is indirect and wordy. Using active verbs makes the meaning clearer and more concise.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...more long-term research is needed to find out how safe and effective single-incision slings are...\"\n\n3. **Remove redundant definitions.** One of the key messages defines the same term twice in the same sentence, which is confusing and unnecessary.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...autologous fascial slings (made from a woman's own body tissue), which are a type of sling made from the patient's own tissue.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Repeating the definition makes the sentence clunky and may cause readers to wonder if they missed a subtle difference.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...autologous fascial slings (slings made from a woman's own body tissue).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 61.1% of features in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates from typical patterns in four areas related to vocabulary and word choice: nominalization (P90), noun count (P90), SMOG index (P90), and Dale-Chall complex words (P90). These metrics indicate that while sentences are a good length, the text relies on complex noun-based phrases and contains some vocabulary that could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
