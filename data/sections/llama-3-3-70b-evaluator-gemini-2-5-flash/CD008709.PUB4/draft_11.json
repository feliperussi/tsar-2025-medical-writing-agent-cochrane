  "draft": "Are single-incision sling operations as effective as other surgical methods for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages:\n- Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as other surgical methods, such as retropubic slings and transobturator slings, for treating stress urinary incontinence in women.\n- The evidence suggests that single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings.\n- Future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments for stress urinary incontinence include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the mid-urethra.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations. They aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings, and to identify any uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes.\n\nHow did the review authors search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating single-incision sling procedures for female urinary incontinence. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, and two trials registers. We handsearched journals, conference proceedings, and reference lists of relevant articles to 20 September 2022.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other types of slings, such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. Most studies lasted for around 12 months. The population characteristics were not explicitly stated, but all participants were women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions compared were different types of sling operations, and there were no studies comparing single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nSingle-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. It is uncertain if single-incision slings lead to better or worse rates of subjective cure or improvement compared with autologous fascial slings. Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings. The effect of single-incision slings on the risk of dyspareunia is uncertain compared with transobturator slings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know their treatment), the sample sizes were very small, and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revision to make it clearer for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of undefined technical terms and overly academic language, which makes the text dense and difficult to follow. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain technical terms and simplify complex language.** The text uses many medical terms without explanation, which will confuse readers. The overall tone is also more academic than a typical plain language summary.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society.\" and terms like \"retropubic slings,\" \"transobturator slings,\" and \"autologous fascial slings.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"imposes a... burden\" are abstract and impersonal. Technical terms for different surgeries are meaningless to a reader without a simple explanation of what they are.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Change the first sentence to: \"This condition can have a big impact on a person's health, daily life, and finances.\" For the surgical terms, add brief parenthetical definitions, for example: \"...compared single-incision slings to other types, such as autologous fascial slings (using the person's own tissue), retropubic slings (placed behind the pubic bone), and transobturator slings (passed through an opening in the hip bone).\"\n\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.** The draft frequently uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes sentences feel passive and dense.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. Using a direct verb makes the sentence more active and easier to understand.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The review authors wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work...\"\n\n3. **Add crucial context to the second key message.** The second key message highlights a benefit but omits the important uncertainty about side effects mentioned in the source material.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence suggests that single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This is factually incomplete and could be misleading. Readers need to know about the trade-offs and uncertainties to make informed decisions.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Single-incision slings may cause less long-term pain than transobturator slings, but we are still uncertain about other side effects and long-term results.\"\n\nThese clarity issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has a very high number of complex words, long words, and nouns compared to typical plain language summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length is good (in the best 25% of the corpus), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics, including `nouns`, `complex_words`, `long_words`, `complex_words_dc`, and the `smog_index` readability score, are beyond the 90th percentile. This indicates the language is much more technical and dense than a typical PLS. Additionally, `nominalization` and the `coleman_liau_index` are in the 75th-90th percentile range, reinforcing that the primary issue is complex word choice rather than sentence structure."
