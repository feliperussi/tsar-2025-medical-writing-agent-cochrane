  "draft": "Are single-incision sling operations as effective as other types of sling operations for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking urine when you cough, sneeze, or exercise) in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings (placed through a cut in the abdomen) and are as effective as transobturator slings (placed through a cut in the thigh) for treating stress urinary incontinence. We are uncertain how they compare with autologous fascial slings (made from a woman's own body tissue).\n- The use of single-incision slings probably reduces the risk of patient-reported pain after surgery compared to transobturator slings.\n- The review authors concluded that future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women. We summarized and combined their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other treatments such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to other sling types, we found:\n- Transobturator slings: Single-incision slings are just as effective at improving incontinence. They probably cause less long-term pain after surgery. The risk of the mesh material causing problems was similar for both types.\n- Retropubic slings: Single-incision slings may be as effective at improving incontinence, but we are less certain. We are also uncertain about the risk of mesh problems or other complications.\n- Autologous fascial slings: We did not find enough evidence to compare them with single-incision slings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and limited coverage of the relevant populations and outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 20 September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. It is very close to approval. However, a few improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues involve simplifying some formal language and ensuring all technical terms are clearly explained.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain all technical terms, including those in the Key Messages.** The term 'mid-urethral slings' is introduced without a definition, which could confuse readers.\n   - **Quote:** \"...future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings.\"\n   - **Problem:** Readers won't know what 'mid-urethral slings' are or how they relate to the other sling types mentioned.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a simple definition in parentheses. For example: \"...compared to other mid-urethral slings (the group of surgeries that includes retropubic and transobturator slings).\"\n\n2. **Replace formal, abstract language with more direct, everyday words.** Some phrases are unnecessarily academic and reduce readability.\n   - **Quote:** \"It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society.\"\n   - **Problem:** This language is common in research abstracts but is too formal for a plain language summary. Phrases like 'imposes a burden' are not how people typically speak.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more direct and relatable. For example: \"This condition can have a major impact on a person's health, well-being, and finances.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent and clear language when describing complications.** The description of mesh-related issues could be clearer and more consistent.\n   - **Quote:** \"The risk of the mesh material causing problems was similar...\" and \"We are also uncertain about the risk of mesh problems or other complications.\"\n   - **Problem:** The term 'mesh problems' is vague. A plain language summary is the perfect place to briefly explain what this means for the patient.\n   - **Suggestion:** Be more specific and consistent. For example, when first mentioning it: \"The risk of the mesh material causing complications (like wearing away or showing through the vaginal wall) was similar for both types.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and style. Sentence length and use of active voice are particularly strong. However, the SMOG index (13.8) is higher than typical, suggesting that the presence of complex, multi-syllable words (e.g., 'incontinence', 'transobturator', 'retropubic') may pose a challenge for some readers. This supports the recommendation to ensure all technical terms are clearly defined and surrounding language is kept as simple as possible."
