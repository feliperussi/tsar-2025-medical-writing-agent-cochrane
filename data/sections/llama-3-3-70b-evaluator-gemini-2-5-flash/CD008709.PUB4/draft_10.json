It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments for stress urinary incontinence include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the mid-urethra.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations. They aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings, and to identify any uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating single‑incision sling procedures for female urinary incontinence.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nRelevant data were extracted, pooled, and meta‑analysed to estimate the effectiveness of the intervention.\n### Confidence in Evidence\nThe certainty of the evidence was appraised using GRADE criteria to inform the overall conclusions.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other types of slings, such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. Most studies lasted for around 12 months. The population characteristics were not explicitly stated, but all participants were women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions compared were different types of sling operations, and there were no studies comparing single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures. Overall, the included studies provided a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness and safety of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women.\n### Main results: Treatment effectiveness and safety\nSingle-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. It is uncertain if single-incision slings lead to better or worse rates of subjective cure or improvement compared with autologous fascial slings. Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings. The effect of single-incision slings on the risk of dyspareunia is uncertain compared with transobturator slings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know their treatment), the sample sizes were very small, and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

Only 5.6% of features are in the best quartile, while 44.4% are 'Beyond P90' and 38.9% are in the 'P90 range', indicating substantial deviation. Key metrics showing significant deviation include high nominalization (32.0 vs. median <13.0), excessive nouns (246.0 vs. median <116.0), and high scores across all readability indices (e.g., Gunning Fog Index 21.60 vs. median <17.8, SMOG Index 17.73 vs. median <12.1, Flesch Reading Ease 28.02 vs. median >40.5). Sentence structure metrics also show deviation with high words per sentence (25.83 vs. median <22.1) and high passive voice (21.0 vs. median <13.0). These metrics collectively point to a text that is too complex, dense, and difficult for the target audience."
