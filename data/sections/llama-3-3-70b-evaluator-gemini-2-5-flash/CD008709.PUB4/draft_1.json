  "draft": "# Are single-incision sling operations (a minimally-invasive surgery using a synthetic device to support the urethra) as effective as other types of sling operations for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n**Key Messages**\n- Single-incision sling operations (a minimally-invasive surgery using a synthetic device to support the urethra) may be as effective as other types of sling operations, such as retropubic slings and transobturator slings, for treating stress urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine, often caused by physical movement or activity) in women, with similar benefits in terms of subjective cure or improvement of incontinence, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the comparison with autologous fascial slings (a type of sling made from the patient's own tissue).\n- The use of single-incision slings probably reduces the risk of patient-reported pain after surgery compared to transobturator slings, and may have a lower risk of mesh exposure, extrusion, or erosion (complications where the synthetic mesh used in the sling causes problems), but there are still uncertainties regarding other adverse events (unwanted effects) and longer-term outcomes, highlighting the need for more research in this area.\n- Future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings, including their potential benefits and harms, to help inform decision-making for women with stress urinary incontinence and their healthcare providers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments for stress urinary incontinence include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the mid-urethra.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations. They aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings, and to identify any uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effectiveness of this treatment.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other treatments such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. Most studies were conducted in various countries around the world, with the search for studies done up to 20 September 2022. The duration of the studies is not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the primary outcome was measured at 12 months. The population characteristics are not detailed, but all studies involved women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. There is no overview of study funding sources provided in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons varied, with single-incision slings being compared to different types of slings. No studies were found comparing single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures.\n### Main results: Effectiveness of single-incision slings\nSingle-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. It is unclear if single-incision slings lead to better or worse rates of subjective cure or improvement compared with autologous fascial slings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and limited coverage of the relevant populations and outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

Additionally, the text contains multiple significant clarity and style issues, including overly long and complex sentences, excessive nominalization, and noun-heavy phrasing. These issues are consistently supported by the linguistic metrics, which show significant deviation from typical PLS patterns across almost all readability and complexity measures.",

While the word count is within limits, almost all readability indices (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, Dale-Chall, Coleman-Liau, ARI, LIX, RIX) are outside the typical range (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10), suggesting the text is much harder to read than average PLS documents. Key structural and vocabulary metrics like `words_per_sentence` (27.92, BEYOND_P90), `nominalization` (30.0, BEYOND_P90), `nouns` (245.0, BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (186.0, BEYOND_P90), and `long_words` (250.0, BEYOND_P90) are all significantly higher than typical, confirming issues with sentence length, noun-heavy phrasing, and complex vocabulary."
