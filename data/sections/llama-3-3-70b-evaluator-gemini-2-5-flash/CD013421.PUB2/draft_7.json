  "draft": "Do sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of bleeding complications during vascular surgery, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care controls, although the quality of the evidence is limited.\n- Future studies should aim to provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery, including their cost-effectiveness and potential adverse events, to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts, known as anastomoses, may be necessary. However, these anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure. This bleeding can be a significant problem, as it may lead to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are not effective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for achieving anastomotic hemostasis (stopping bleeding) in vascular surgery, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants who underwent vascular surgery. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not certain. Sealants may make little to no difference in the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention. The studies were very small. The studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the intervention because they represent only a small set of the studies on the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It requires revisions for factual accuracy and clarity before it can be published. While the structure is good, the language is too complex and one key finding is not accurately represented.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Critical Issue: Clarify the Main Finding Accurately**\nThe summary uses the term 'bleeding complications,' which is a vague and potentially misleading simplification of the review's actual finding.\n\n- **Problem:** The review found that sealants may reduce 'hemostatic intervention failure' (meaning, the first attempt to stop bleeding is more likely to succeed), not all 'bleeding complications.' This is an important distinction, as the review found no clear difference in 'postoperative bleeding.' Using the current term could confuse readers.\n- **Quote:** \"Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of **bleeding complications** during vascular surgery...\"\n- **Suggestion:** Replace 'bleeding complications' with a more accurate, plain language description. For example: \"...and may reduce how often the initial treatment to stop bleeding fails.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Complex and Technical Vocabulary**\nThe text uses many long, technical words that will be difficult for a lay audience to understand, making the summary feel dense and academic.\n\n- **Problem:** Words like 'anastomoses,' 'hemostasis,' 'conventional interventions,' and 'synthetic grafts' create barriers to understanding, even when they are defined.\n- **Quote:** \"Various surgical options are available for achieving hemostasis, or the stopping of bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Replace these with simpler alternatives throughout the text. For example: \"Surgeons have several ways to stop bleeding, such as applying sealants directly to the blood vessel.\"\n\n**3. Shorten Long, Complicated Sentences**\nSome sentences are too long and complex, particularly in the key messages, making them hard for readers to follow.\n\n- **Problem:** The final key message is a 38-word sentence packed with abstract nouns ('effectiveness', 'decision-making'), which reduces readability.\n- **Quote:** \"Future studies should aim to provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery, including their cost-effectiveness and potential adverse events, to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Break this into two shorter, more direct sentences. For example: \"Future studies should provide better evidence on how well sealants work and how safe they are. This research should also look at costs and side effects to help doctors and patients make better decisions.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** This feedback is supported by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very high number of long and complex words (`long_words`: BEYOND_P90, `complex_words`: P90), which makes the text harder to read than typical plain language summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, particularly in sentence structure and use of active voice. However, it reveals significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, indicating the text is much harder to read than is typical for a PLS. The key areas for improvement are the high counts of nouns (159.0), complex Dale-Chall words (235.0), complex words with 3+ syllables (123.0), and long words with 7+ characters (215.0), which also results in a high SMOG index (14.14)."
