  "draft": "Do sealants help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of bleeding failures during vascular surgery, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, or bleeding after surgery between using sealants and the usual treatments, although the quality of the evidence is limited.\n- Future studies should provide better evidence on how well sealants work and how safe they are, including their cost-effectiveness and potential side effects, to help doctors and patients make better decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. These connections can bleed from the holes made during the procedure. This bleeding can be a major problem and may lead to serious complications. Surgeons have several ways to stop bleeding, such as applying sealants directly to the blood vessel.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding areas when other methods are not effective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding during vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding failures, and other important outcomes, compared to the usual treatments.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for stopping bleeding in vascular surgery, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 people who had surgery on their blood vessels. The studies compared sealant use with the usual treatments, including other methods to stop bleeding. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding failures, but the evidence is not certain. Sealants may make little to no difference in the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention. The studies were very small. The studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the treatment because they represent only a small set of the studies on the treatment.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and meets most style guidelines. However, a few key revisions are needed to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the term \"bleeding failures.\"** This phrase appears multiple times but is not clear to a non-medical reader.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"...reduce the rate of bleeding failures...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** It's unclear what it means for a bleeding event to \"fail.\" Readers might not understand if this refers to the failure of the sealant, the failure of the body's clotting, or the failure of the surgeon's first attempt to stop the bleeding.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Replace \"bleeding failures\" with a clearer explanation, such as \"failure of the treatment to stop bleeding\" or \"the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding did not work.\"\n\n2. **Improve the structure of the \"Limitations\" section.** The current format is a single, dense paragraph that is difficult to read.\n    - **Problematic text:** The entire paragraph under \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This paragraph combines five distinct limitations into a single block of text, making it hard for readers to absorb the different issues. The Cochrane style guide recommends using bullet points for lists to improve readability.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Convert the paragraph into a bulleted list. For example:\n        - We have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting.\n        - Not all studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in.\n        - The studies were very small and used different methods.\n        - We suspect that studies showing positive results were more likely to be published, which could exaggerate the treatment's benefits.\n\n3. **Simplify the explanation of publication bias.** The final sentence in the \"Limitations\" section is confusing.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"The studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the treatment because they represent only a small set of the studies on the treatment.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The reasoning is not clear. It doesn't explain *why* representing a \"small set\" would lead to exaggerated benefits.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Provide a more direct explanation of publication bias. For example: \"We are concerned that studies showing sealants worked well were more likely to be published than studies showing no benefit. This could make the benefits seem larger than they really are.\"\n\nThe linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and plain language. The text uses short sentences, active voice, and an appropriate tone. However, the analysis identified a high number of long words (7+ characters), which is in the 90th percentile. This aligns with the editorial feedback to simplify some of the more complex phrasing, particularly in the 'Limitations' section, to enhance reader understanding.",
