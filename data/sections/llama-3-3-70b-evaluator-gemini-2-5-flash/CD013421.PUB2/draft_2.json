  "draft": "Do sealants help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery?\nWe looked at the evidence on using sealants - special liquids or materials - to stop bleeding during operations on blood vessels. \n\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is uncertain. \n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care. \n- Future studies should provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts - known as anastomoses - may be necessary. These anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure, leading to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are ineffective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n\nWhat methods did the authors use?\nWe searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not very certain. \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, the studies varied in populations and intervention delivery methods, sample sizes were very small, and the studies that did provide results likely represent a selective subset.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, to make it even more accessible for patients, I recommend focusing on simplifying a few key technical terms and phrases. Here are the top 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify technical language in the 'Methods' section.**\n   - **The issue:** The phrase \"achieving anastomotic hemostasis\" is very technical, even with prior definitions.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods to stop bleeding where blood vessels were joined.\"\n\n2. **Remove unnecessary specialist terms from the 'Results'.**\n   - **The issue:** Naming specific materials like \"oxidized cellulose\" and \"gelatin sponge\" adds complexity without aiding understanding. Focusing on the general approach is clearer for a lay audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared using sealants with standard care, such as applying pressure by hand (manual compression).\"\n\n3. **Explain the *impact* of limitations in plain language.**\n   - **The issue:** The term \"selective subset\" is vague. It's crucial to explain *why* this is a problem for the evidence.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...and the studies that did provide results likely represent a selective subset.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and the studies that showed a benefit may be a select group, which could make the sealants seem more effective than they really are.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile. Readability and sentence structure are excellent. The primary area for improvement is vocabulary choice, as indicated by the 'long_words' metric, which is in the P90 range. This supports the editorial feedback to replace technical jargon with simpler, more common words to enhance reader understanding."
