  "draft": "# Do sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of hemostatic (bleeding stoppage) failure during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels), but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care controls, although the quality of the evidence is limited.\n- Future studies should aim to provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery, including their cost-effectiveness and potential adverse events, to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts, known as anastomoses, may be necessary. However, these anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure. This bleeding can be a significant problem, as it may lead to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n### What are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are ineffective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. All trials were at high risk of performance bias, detection bias, and other sources of bias. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons were sealant use versus standard care controls. No information was available on the duration of the studies. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not very certain. Sealants may make little to no difference in the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery. It is unclear if sealants have an effect on the risk of returning to the operating room for bleeding complications or if they have any effect on death or quality of life.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment (risk of bias from lack of blinding), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, the studies varied in populations and intervention delivery methods, sample sizes were very small, and the studies that did provide results likely represent a selective subset, which may exaggerate the intervention’s benefits.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The 'Methods' subheading is not phrased as a question, violating the style guide. Additionally, the Key Messages contain redundant definitions, and the text frequently uses long, noun-heavy, and passive sentences, making it dense and difficult to follow. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows significant deviations from typical Plain Language Summary patterns in sentence length, vocabulary complexity, and nominalization.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis indicates moderate conformity with PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling within the best quartile. However, 38.9% of features are in the P90 range and 11.1% are beyond P90, indicating significant deviations. Specifically, the draft shows higher than typical values for words per sentence (25.19, P90), nominalization (21.00, P90), nouns (198.00, P90), LIX (61.99, P90), RIX (9.27, P90), SMOG index (14.75, P90), complex words (137.00, P90), complex words (Dale-Chall) (280.00, BEYOND_P90), and long words (241.00, BEYOND_P90). These metrics collectively suggest that the text is more complex and dense than typical PLS documents, primarily due to long sentences and complex vocabulary."
