  "draft": "This review looks at whether using special materials called sealants can help stop bleeding faster and reduce problems during surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery). Sealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding areas when other methods are not effective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients. We wanted to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding and the rate of bleeding failures during vascular surgery.\n\nKey Messages\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce how often the initial treatment to stop bleeding fails during vascular surgery, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, or bleeding after surgery between using sealants and standard care controls, although the quality of the evidence is limited.\n- Future studies should provide better evidence on how well sealants work and how safe they are. This research should also look at costs and side effects to help doctors and patients make better decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery? During vascular surgery, surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. These connections can bleed from the holes made during the procedure. This bleeding can be a major problem and may lead to serious complications. Surgeons have several ways to stop bleeding, such as applying sealants directly to the blood vessel.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery? Sealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding areas when other methods are not effective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding during vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding failures, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use? We searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for stopping bleeding in vascular surgery, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find? We found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants who underwent vascular surgery. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including other methods to stop bleeding. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding failures, but the evidence is not certain. Sealants may make little to no difference in the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention. The studies were very small. The studies that provide results for our review are likely to overstate the benefits of the treatment because they represent only a small set of the studies on the treatment.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it is not yet approved because several improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are repetition in the introduction, the use of overly technical or formal language, and some noun-heavy sentences that could be more direct. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier for patients to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Remove redundant information in the introduction.** The first and fourth paragraphs are nearly identical, which can be confusing for the reader. \n   - **Problem Text:** The first paragraph ends with: \"Sealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery... it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\" The fourth paragraph repeats this almost word-for-word under the heading \"What are sealants...\".\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Delete the last three sentences from the introductory paragraph. The information is presented more appropriately under its own subheading later.\n\n2. **Replace complex and formal words with simpler, everyday language.** Some terms are too clinical for a plain language summary.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"...compared sealant use with standard care controls...\", \"...participants who underwent vascular surgery.\", \"The studies that provide results for our review are likely to overstate the benefits of the treatment...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \n     - Change \"standard care controls\" to \"the usual treatments\".\n     - Change \"participants who underwent vascular surgery\" to \"people who had surgery on their blood vessels\".\n     - Change \"overstate the benefits of the treatment\" to \"exaggerate the benefits of the treatment\" (which is also closer to the source text).\n\n3. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of nouns.** Some sentences are noun-heavy, which can make them harder to follow.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"This research should also look at costs and side effects to help doctors and patients make better decisions.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This research should also look at costs and side effects to help doctors and patients decide on the best treatment.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of long and complex words compared to typical summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability. The sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified three areas for improvement that deviate from typical patterns: the number of long words (words with 7+ characters) is beyond the 90th percentile, and the counts for nouns and Dale-Chall complex words are in the 75th-90th percentile range. This suggests that simplifying vocabulary and reducing noun-heavy phrases would bring the text more in line with standard PLS style and improve clarity."
