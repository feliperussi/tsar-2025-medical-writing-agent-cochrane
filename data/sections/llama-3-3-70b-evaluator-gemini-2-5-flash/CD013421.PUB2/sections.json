  "key_messages": [
    "Sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of hemostatic (bleeding stoppage) failure during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels), but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this.",
    "The current evidence does not show a clear difference in intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care controls, although the quality of the evidence is limited.",
    "Future studies should aim to provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery, including their cost-effectiveness and potential adverse events, to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?",
      "content": "During vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts, known as anastomoses, may be necessary. However, these anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure. This bleeding can be a significant problem, as it may lead to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues."

      "subheading": "What are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?",
      "content": "Sealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are not effective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants who underwent vascular surgery. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. All trials were at high risk of performance bias, detection bias, and other sources of bias. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons were sealant use versus standard care controls. No information was available on the duration of the studies. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not certain. Sealants may make little to no difference in the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery. It is unclear if sealants have an effect on death from bleeding complications or quality of life."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention. The studies were very small. The studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the intervention because they represent only a small set of the studies on intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
