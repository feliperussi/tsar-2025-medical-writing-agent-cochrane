  "draft": "Do sealants help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery?\nWe looked at the evidence on using sealants - special liquids or materials - to stop bleeding during operations on blood vessels.\n\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the bleeding fails to stop, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care.\n- Future studies should provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts - known as anastomoses - may be necessary. These anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure, leading to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are ineffective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n\nWhat methods did the authors use?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods to stop bleeding where blood vessels were joined. We summarized their results and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence, which helps us understand how reliable the findings are.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants. The studies compared using sealants with standard care, such as applying pressure by hand (manual compression). Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not very certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n- The studies were all very small.\n- The way sealants were used and the types of patients involved were different across the studies.\n- We suspect that studies with positive results were more likely to be published, which could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity and fully align with Cochrane style before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Make the point of view consistent.**\n   - **The issue:** The text switches between third person (\"the review authors\") and first person (\"we\"). The style guide requires using \"we\" and \"our\" consistently when referring to the review team.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to evaluate...\" followed later by \"What methods did the authors use? We searched for studies...\"\n   - **Suggested change:** Change \"The review authors wanted to evaluate...\" to \"We wanted to evaluate...\" and ensure the first-person perspective is used throughout the summary.\n\n2. **Simplify complex language, especially after introducing jargon.**\n   - **The issue:** While you correctly define the technical term \"anastomoses,\" you immediately use it again in the next sentence. This can be challenging for a reader who has just learned the word. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a higher-than-usual number of long words.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"...connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts - known as anastomoses - may be necessary. These anastomoses can bleed...\"\n   - **Suggested change:** After defining a term, use simpler language to reinforce the concept. For example: \"During vascular surgery, surgeons may need to create connections (called anastomoses) between blood vessels. These new connections can sometimes bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure...\"\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language.**\n   - **The issue:** Some sentences are a bit wordy and use passive phrasing, which can make them less direct and harder to read.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\"\n   - **Suggested change:** Rewrite sentences to be more active and concise. For example: \"Surgeons have several ways to stop this bleeding. One option is to apply sealants directly to the bleeding area.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and structure are excellent. However, the metric for 'long_words' (words with 7+ characters) is in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual density of long words. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify some of the vocabulary to further improve clarity for a lay audience."
