  "draft": "# Do sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of hemostatic (bleeding stoppage) failure during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels), but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care controls, although the quality of the evidence is limited.\n- Future studies should aim to provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery, including their cost-effectiveness and potential adverse events, to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts, known as anastomoses, may be necessary. However, these anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure. This bleeding can be a significant problem, as it may lead to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n### What are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are not effective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing sealant use with other methods for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants who underwent vascular surgery. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. All trials were at high risk of performance bias, detection bias, and other sources of bias. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons were sealant use versus standard care controls. No information was available on the duration of the studies. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not certain. Sealants may make little to no difference in the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery. It is unclear if sealants have an effect on death from bleeding complications or quality of life.\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention. The studies were very small. The studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the intervention because they represent only a small set of the studies on intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, it fails on a critical check regarding subheading formatting, as 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions. Additionally, the text contains several instances of noun-heavy, wordy, and complex sentences, particularly in the 'Limitations' and 'Results' sections, which would hinder patient understanding. The use of slightly awkward phrasing like 'bleeding stoppage failure' also reduces clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like active voice and pronouns are in the best quartile, a significant number of features deviate from typical patterns, falling into the P90 or Beyond P90 ranges. Specifically, nominalization, nouns, lix, rix, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words are all higher than typical PLS texts. This suggests the text is denser and uses more complex vocabulary and longer words than ideal for a plain language summary, contributing to the clarity issues identified."
