  "draft": "Do sealants help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery?\nWe looked at the evidence on using sealants - special liquids or materials - to stop bleeding during operations on blood vessels.\n\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care.\n- Future studies should provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts - known as anastomoses - may be necessary. These anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure, leading to serious complications. Various surgical options are available to stop the bleeding, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are ineffective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n\nWhat methods did the authors use?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods to stop bleeding where blood vessels were joined. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants. The studies compared using sealants with standard care, such as applying pressure by hand (manual compression). Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not very certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, the studies varied in populations and intervention delivery methods, sample sizes were very small, and the studies that did provide results likely represent a select group, which could make the sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issue is an exceptionally long and complex sentence in the 'Limitations' section that makes it difficult to understand the weaknesses in the evidence. Simplifying this sentence and clarifying some abstract language elsewhere will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break up the long, complex sentence in the limitations section.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, the studies varied in populations and intervention delivery methods, sample sizes were very small, and the studies that did provide results likely represent a select group, which could make the sealants seem more effective than they really are.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 56 words, this sentence lists too many complex ideas at once. It's a significant barrier to understanding why the evidence is not certain.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons:\n     - In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n     - The studies were all very small.\n     - The way sealants were used and the types of patients involved were different across the studies.\n     - We suspect that studies with positive results were more likely to be published, which could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the abstract language in the methods section.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"evaluated our confidence in the evidence\" is jargon. Readers may not understand what this means or why it's an important part of the review process.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We summarized their results and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence, which helps us understand how reliable the findings are.\"\n\n3. **Simplify a key finding in the 'Key Messages' section.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is uncertain.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** While \"bleeding complications\" is a good plain language term, the original source text used \"hemostatic failure\". The draft uses the simpler term in the results section but not in the key messages. To avoid any ambiguity and ensure the message is as clear as possible from the start, a slightly more descriptive term could be used.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the bleeding fails to stop, but the evidence is uncertain.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 11 of 18 metrics (61.1%) in the best quartile for readability and style. Average sentence length (19.04 words) and readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 11.62) are excellent. However, the 'long_words' metric is in the 90th percentile. This indicates a higher-than-usual number of words with 7+ characters, which supports the editorial feedback to simplify some of the more technical vocabulary, particularly in the limitations section."
