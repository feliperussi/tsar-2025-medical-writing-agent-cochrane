  "draft": "Do sealants help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery?\nWe looked at the evidence on using sealants - special liquids or materials - to stop bleeding during operations on blood vessels.\n\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the bleeding fails to stop, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in blood loss during surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, or unplanned return to the operating room between using sealants and standard care.\n- Future studies should provide more robust and unbiased data on the effectiveness and safety of sealants in vascular surgery.\n\nWhat is the problem of bleeding after vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, surgeons may need to create connections (called anastomoses) between blood vessels. These new connections can sometimes bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure, leading to serious complications. Surgeons have several ways to stop this bleeding. One option is to apply sealants directly to the bleeding area.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials designed to help stop bleeding in vascular surgery. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses when conventional interventions are ineffective. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, it is not clear how well they work in vascular surgery patients.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding at the anastomotic site in patients undergoing vascular surgery. We aimed to find out if sealants can reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding, the rate of bleeding complications, and other important outcomes, compared to standard treatments.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods to stop bleeding where blood vessels were joined. We summarized their results and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence, which helps us understand how reliable the findings are.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants. The studies compared using sealants with standard care, such as applying pressure by hand (manual compression). Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding after vascular surgery and may reduce the rate of bleeding complications, but the evidence is not very certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n- The studies were all very small.\n- The way sealants were used and the types of patients involved were different across the studies.\n- We suspect that studies with positive results were more likely to be published, which could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
