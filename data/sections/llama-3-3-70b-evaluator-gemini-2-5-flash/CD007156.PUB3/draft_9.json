  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different treatments for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including different types of drugs, surgery, and physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting condition of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to slowly tighten, which can cause severe pain and make it hard to open your mouth fully. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe main treatment is helping people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut. Other treatments include different types of drugs. These can be taken by mouth, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the affected area. Surgical procedures and other therapies, like physiotherapy or ultrasound, may also be used.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nWe wanted to see how well different treatments improved symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. Researchers conducted these studies in various countries, and the studies lasted for different lengths of time, from less than three months to over six months. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis and summarized their results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of the treatments.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and meets most of the key criteria, but it cannot be approved due to a critical factual inconsistency in the key messages. Here are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the Certainty of the Main Finding in the Key Messages.**\n   - **The issue:** The first key message understates the confidence in the main finding.\n   - **Your text:** '- We found that antioxidants... **may** slightly improve mouth opening...'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The word 'may' implies low certainty. However, the review found 'moderate-certainty evidence', and the abstract and your own results section correctly use the word 'probably'. This inconsistency could mislead readers about the most important result of the review.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** '- We found that antioxidants... **probably** improve mouth opening slightly...'\n\n2. **Explain Key Research Terms for a Lay Audience.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary uses a technical term without defining it.\n   - **Your text:** 'We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening...'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** A patient or member of the public is unlikely to know what 'moderate-certainty evidence' means. Defining this term helps them understand the level of confidence we have in the findings.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found moderate-certainty evidence (this means we are moderately confident in the finding) that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening...'\n\n3. **Improve the Structure of the Results Section for Clarity.**\n   - **The issue:** The 'What did we Find?' section mixes details about the studies with the main results in a single paragraph, which can be hard to follow.\n   - **Your text:** 'We found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. Researchers conducted these studies in various countries, and the studies lasted for different lengths of time, from less than three months to over six months. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Separating the description of the studies from the key findings makes the main takeaways easier to identify and understand.\n   - **Suggested rewrite (split into two paragraphs):**\n   'We found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies tested different treatments for periods ranging from less than three months to over six months.\n\n   Our main finding is that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. This was based on moderate-certainty evidence. For all other treatments, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, so we cannot be confident about their effects.'\n\nWhile the draft's readability scores are excellent, addressing these specific issues of accuracy and clarity is essential before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges. Key indicators of readability are strong, with an Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.6 and low use of passive voice (9 instances). The text is well-structured at a sentence level, with an average sentence length of 16.8 words. These results suggest the draft is stylistically sound and generally easy to read."
