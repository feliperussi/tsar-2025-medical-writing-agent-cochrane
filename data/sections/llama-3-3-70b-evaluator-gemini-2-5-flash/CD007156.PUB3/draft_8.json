  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different treatments for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including different types of drugs, surgery, and physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting condition of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to slowly tighten, which can cause severe pain and make it hard to open your mouth fully. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe main treatment is helping people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut. Other treatments may include drugs that are taken by mouth or injection, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the area, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nWe wanted to see how well different treatments improved symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. Researchers conducted these studies in various countries, and the studies lasted for different lengths of time. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for this condition.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, a few key sentences are too long and complex, which could make them difficult for some readers to follow. Here are the top 3 improvements to enhance clarity:\\n\\n1. **Simplify the list of treatments.** The sentence describing treatments is long and contains a complex list.\\n    - **Current sentence:** 'Other treatments may include drugs that are taken by mouth or injection, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the area, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.'\\n    - **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter sentences to make the different treatment types clearer. For example: 'Other treatments include different types of drugs. These can be taken by mouth, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the affected area. Surgical procedures and other therapies, like physiotherapy or ultrasound, may also be used.'\\n\\n2. **Add specific detail about study duration.** The current description is too vague to be helpful for the reader.\\n    - **Current phrase:** '...and the studies lasted for different lengths of time.'\\n    - **Suggestion:** Add the more specific information available in the source material to provide better context. For example: '...and the studies lasted for different lengths of time, from less than three months to over six months.'\\n\\n3. **Shorten the methods description.** The sentence explaining the review process combines too many ideas and is over 30 words long.\\n    - **Current sentence:** 'We searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for this condition.'\\n    - **Suggestion:** Split this into two distinct steps for easier reading. For example: 'We searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis and summarized their results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of the treatments.'\\n\\nWhile the overall readability scores are excellent, addressing these specific long sentences will ensure the entire summary is as clear as possible for all readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Key indicators like an average sentence length of 18 words (P25) and a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10.3 (P25) are excellent. However, these strong averages mask a few specific instances of overly long sentences (over 30 words) that should be revised for maximum clarity, as noted in the feedback."
