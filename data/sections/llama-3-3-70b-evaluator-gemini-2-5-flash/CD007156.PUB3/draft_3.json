  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy.\n- Future studies should focus on conducting high-quality, adequately powered trials that compare biologically plausible treatments for oral submucous fibrosis, with a low risk of bias, and that evaluate relevant participant-reported outcomes.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. It affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. Antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. However, it is unclear if other interventions have an effect on these outcomes. The evidence for these findings is mostly of low or very low certainty, and more research is needed to confirm the results.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because many studies were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. This lack of blinding, along with the small study sizes and incomplete coverage of relevant populations, interventions, and outcomes, limits our ability to draw firm conclusions.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for this condition.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start, but it is not yet approved. There is one critical issue with formatting and a few key areas where clarity and accuracy can be significantly improved for a lay audience. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\n*   **Subheading Format:** One subheading does not follow the required question format. The subheading 'Methods' must be rephrased as a question (e.g., 'How did we conduct this review?').\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Clarify the Certainty of Evidence for the Main Finding:** The summary is inconsistent and potentially misleading about the strength of the evidence for antioxidants. The abstract states there is 'moderate-certainty' evidence, but the PLS downplays this.\n    *   **Problematic Sentences:** In the key messages, you state, '...the quality of the evidence is not strong.' In the results, you say, 'The evidence for these findings is mostly of low or very low certainty...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This contradicts the abstract's conclusion of 'moderate-certainty evidence' for the main positive finding. It lumps the strongest finding in with all the weaker ones, which may confuse the reader about what we know versus what we don't.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite (for the 'What did we find?' section):** 'We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.'\n\n2.  **Simplify Technical Language in the Key Messages:** The final key message uses research jargon that is not suitable for a plain language summary.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** 'Future studies should focus on conducting high-quality, adequately powered trials that compare biologically plausible treatments for oral submucous fibrosis, with a low risk of bias, and that evaluate relevant participant-reported outcomes.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'adequately powered trials', 'biologically plausible', 'low risk of bias', and 'participant-reported outcomes' are unfamiliar to most patients and create a barrier to understanding.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.'\n\n3.  **Make the Limitations Section More Concrete:** The explanation of limitations uses abstract phrasing that could be clearer.\n    *   **Problematic Phrase:** '...incomplete coverage of relevant populations, interventions, and outcomes...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is vague. It doesn't explain to the reader *why* this is a limitation or what it means in practical terms.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite (for the 'Limitations' section):** 'We have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour suggestions to simplify technical language are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns for complex and long words. The SMOG Index (14.2) and Long Words count (177) are higher than is typical, indicating that replacing jargon with more common words would improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in two areas related to vocabulary complexity: the SMOG Index (P90) and the count of long words (P90). This suggests the text contains pockets of polysyllabic and long words that increase reading difficulty, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify technical jargon."
