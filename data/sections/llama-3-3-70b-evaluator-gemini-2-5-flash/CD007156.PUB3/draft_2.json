  "draft": "Effective Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis: Managing Pain and Improving Mouth Opening\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis, but the quality of the evidence is not strong.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis.\n- Future studies should focus on conducting high-quality trials that compare biologically plausible treatments for oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. It affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. Antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. However, it is unclear if other interventions have an effect on these outcomes. The evidence for these findings is mostly of low or very low certainty, and more research is needed to confirm the results.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start but is not yet approved because it fails two critical checks: the main title is not phrased as a question, and a 'Methods' section is missing. Additionally, several improvements are needed to ensure the text is clear and easy for a patient to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain technical terms for the reader.** The draft misses opportunities to define key terms that were included in the source material, making it harder for readers to understand the treatment.\n    - **Problem:** 'We found that antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening...'\n    - **Suggestion:** Add the simple definition provided in the source material: 'We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening...'\n\n2. **Simplify the 'Limitations' section.** The current wording uses research jargon that will be unfamiliar to most readers, preventing them from understanding the weaknesses in the evidence.\n    - **Problem:** 'The evidence is limited by possible  lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.'\n    - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this to explain the concepts, using the plain language explanation from the source material. For example: 'We have limited confidence in the evidence because many studies were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting (this is known as a lack of 'blinding'), which can affect the results.'\n\n3. **Make the main finding more direct.** The language in the results section is slightly too academic for a plain language summary.\n    - **Problem:** 'Antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation.'\n    - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this more directly for a lay audience and state the evidence certainty clearly: 'The review found that taking antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning feeling. We have moderate confidence in this evidence.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges of the corpus, indicating a solid structural foundation. For example, the average sentence length (19.2 words) and use of passive voice (9 instances) are both in the best quartile (P25). However, readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (12.5) and Gunning Fog Index (16.9) are in the median range, suggesting that while the structure is sound, the vocabulary in specific sections could be simplified to improve reader comprehension, as noted in the feedback."
