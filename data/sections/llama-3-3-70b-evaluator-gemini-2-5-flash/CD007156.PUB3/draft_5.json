  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis. \n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. It affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for this condition.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it is not approved because several key technical terms are left unexplained, which could confuse or worry a patient. Here are the top 3 improvements to make the summary clearer for your audience:\n\n1. **Replace critical medical jargon with plain language.**\n   - **Problem:** In the section 'What is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?', the draft states: \"...and increases the risk of oral malignancy.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** 'Oral malignancy' is a clinical term for cancer. Using plain, direct language is essential, especially for a serious diagnosis, to ensure the message is understood without causing unnecessary anxiety from uncertainty.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this as: \"...and increases the risk of mouth cancer.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex phrases about treatment.**\n   - **Problem:** In the section 'What are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?', the draft says: \"The mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This phrase is abstract and full of jargon. A reader may not understand what 'behavioral interventions' or 'habit cessation' means in practice.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this to be more direct and concrete: \"The main treatment has been support to help people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut.\"\n\n3. **Explain the different types of drug treatments.**\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs\" is used in both the key messages and the main text without any explanation.\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Most readers won't know the difference between these drug delivery methods. Briefly defining them clarifies what the research actually covers and makes the summary more informative.\n   - **Suggestion:** When this phrase first appears, add a brief, simple explanation. For example: \"...different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. These include drugs that are taken by mouth or injection (systemic), injected into the cheek (locally delivered), or applied directly to the area (topical)...\"\n\nMaking these changes will also help address the high number of long words noted in the evaluation report, improving overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and active voice usage are excellent. However, the 'long_words' metric is in the 90th percentile, indicating a higher-than-usual number of words with 7 or more characters. This aligns with editorial findings of specific, unexplained technical terms that need simplification."
