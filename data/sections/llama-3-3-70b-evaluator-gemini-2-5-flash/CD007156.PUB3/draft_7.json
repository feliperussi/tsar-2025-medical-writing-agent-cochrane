  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different treatments for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including drugs that are taken by mouth or injection, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the area, as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting condition of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to slowly tighten, which can cause severe pain and make it hard to open your mouth fully. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe main treatment has been support to help people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut. Other treatments may include drugs that are taken by mouth or injection, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the area, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to find out the benefits and harms of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. Researchers conducted these studies in various countries, and the studies lasted for different lengths of time. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for this condition.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets all critical requirements. The feedback below focuses on minor refinements to make the language even more direct and easier for readers to understand, in line with Cochrane's best practices.\n\n**Critical Issues**\n- None. The draft is complete, factually accurate, and within the word count limit.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** This makes sentences more active and easier to follow.\n    -   **Quote:** \"They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms...\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"assess the effectiveness\" are less direct than simple verbs. Using the verb form makes the sentence shorter and more active.\n    -   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to see how well different treatments improved symptoms...\"\n\n2.  **Make the language more active and direct.** Some sentences can be rephrased to be more straightforward.\n    -   **Quote:** \"The main treatment has been support to help people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly passive and indirect. A more active sentence clearly states what the treatment involves.\n    -   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The main treatment is helping people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify the list of treatments in the key messages.** The key messages should be as concise as possible. The long list of treatment types can be summarized.\n    -   **Quote:** \"...including drugs that are taken by mouth or injection, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the area, as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** This level of detail is better suited for the main body of the text. A shorter summary keeps the key message focused and easy to scan.\n    -   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...including different types of drugs, surgery, and physiotherapy.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence**\nYour draft is very well-written and scores highly on most readability metrics. The suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which identified a high number of 'nominalizations' (21 instances). Addressing this will make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. The text is well under the word limit and has excellent readability scores. The single notable deviation is 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs), which is in the P90 range, suggesting that some sentences could be made more direct by using stronger verbs."
