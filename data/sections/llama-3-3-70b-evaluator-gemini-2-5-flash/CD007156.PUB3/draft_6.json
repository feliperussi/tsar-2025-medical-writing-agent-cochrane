  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including drugs that are taken by mouth or injection (systemic), injected into the cheek (locally delivered), or applied directly to the area (topical), as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. It affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe main treatment has been support to help people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut. Other treatments may include drugs that are taken by mouth or injection (systemic), injected into the cheek (locally delivered), or applied directly to the area (topical), as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for this condition.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

To make it even clearer for patients and fully align with plain language principles, I recommend focusing on the following 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify the definition of the condition.** The current definition is taken directly from the technical abstract and uses language that may be difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** Phrases like \"chronic disease,\" \"oral cavity,\" and \"progressive constriction\" are clinical terms. Explaining them in everyday language will make the summary much more accessible.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting condition of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to slowly tighten, which can cause severe pain and make it hard to open your mouth fully.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex words with simpler alternatives.** The analysis shows a high number of long words, which can make the text challenging. Choosing shorter, more common words will improve readability.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** \"Evaluate,\" \"interventions,\" and \"managing\" are formal words. Simpler synonyms exist.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...find out the benefits and harms of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis.\"\n\n3. **Make sentences more direct and active.** Some sentences are written in the passive voice, which can make them feel less direct and harder to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** The active voice (\"Researchers conducted...\") is clearer about who performed the action and is generally easier to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Researchers conducted these studies in various countries, and the studies lasted for different lengths of time.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft generally conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 61.1% of features falling within the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates in vocabulary complexity. The SMOG index (P90) and the count of long words (P90) are higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests the text may be difficult for some readers due to the use of complex or technical terminology, particularly in the description of the medical condition."
