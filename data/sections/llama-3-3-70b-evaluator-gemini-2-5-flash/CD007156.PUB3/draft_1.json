  "draft": "# Effective Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis: Managing Pain and Improving Mouth Opening\n**Key Messages**\n- Effective treatments for oral submucous fibrosis (a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening) are not well established, but antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with this condition, although the quality of the evidence is not strong.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy, as the current evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- Future studies should focus on conducting high-quality, adequately powered trials that compare biologically plausible treatments for oral submucous fibrosis, with a low risk of bias, and that evaluate relevant participant-reported outcomes, to provide clearer answers about the best ways to manage this condition.\n**Introduction**\n### What is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. It affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n### What are the common treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\nThe mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for this condition.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations, with some studies lasting less than three months, while others lasted for three to six months or more. The studies included a diverse range of interventions, including systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and other interventions such as physiotherapy, ultrasound, or alternative therapies. The participants in the studies had a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of oral submucous fibrosis, but the abstract does not provide detailed information on population characteristics such as age, gender, or severity of condition. The studies compared these interventions against placebo or no active treatment, and some studies also compared different active interventions against each other. Antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. However, it is unclear if other interventions have an effect on these outcomes. The evidence for these findings is mostly of low or very low certainty, and more research is needed to confirm the results.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The main title and several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory style guide requirement. Additionally, the text contains overly long and complex sentences, uses unexplained technical jargon, and relies too heavily on passive voice and nominalization, making it difficult for a patient audience to understand. The PLS evaluation metrics strongly support these observations, showing significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in readability, sentence length, and vocabulary complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with only 11.1% of features falling within the best quartile. Readability is a major concern, as evidenced by a low Flesch Reading Ease score (31.06, P10) and high Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.46, P90), Gunning Fog Index (20.91, P90), SMOG Index (16.08, BEYOND_P90), LIX (64.33, BEYOND_P90), and RIX (10.00, BEYOND_P90). Sentence structure is problematic with a high average of words per sentence (26.29, P90), and elevated passive voice (19.00, P90) and nominalization (23.00, P90) counts. Vocabulary complexity is also very high, with complex words (289.00 Dale-Chall, BEYOND_P90; 164.00 3+ syllables, BEYOND_P90) and long words (240.00 7+ characters, BEYOND_P90) far exceeding typical ranges. These metrics collectively confirm that the text is considerably more challenging to read than a typical Plain Language Summary."
