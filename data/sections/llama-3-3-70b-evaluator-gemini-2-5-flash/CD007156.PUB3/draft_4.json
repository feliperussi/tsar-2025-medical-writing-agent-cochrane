  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis. \n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and other treatments like physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. It affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for this condition.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

However, it is not approved because of a few key clarity issues that need to be addressed. The most important issue is that the summary omits crucial context about the main finding, which could mislead a reader about the treatment's effectiveness. Additionally, some sections use clinical jargon that could be simplified, and a few sentences are longer and more complex than necessary. Addressing these three points will significantly improve the summary's clarity for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of its features falling within the best quartile for readability and style. Metrics for sentence length and readability are excellent. The one notable deviation is the count of 'long_words' (171), which falls in the P90 range, suggesting that some of the vocabulary is more complex than is typical. This metric supports the editorial recommendation to simplify some of the clinical terminology used in the draft."
