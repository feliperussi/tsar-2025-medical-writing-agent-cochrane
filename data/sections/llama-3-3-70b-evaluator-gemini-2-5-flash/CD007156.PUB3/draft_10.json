  "draft": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis. This was based on moderate-certainty evidence, which means we are moderately confident in this finding.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different treatments for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including different types of drugs, surgery, and physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting condition of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to slowly tighten, which can cause severe pain and make it hard to open your mouth fully. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe main treatment is helping people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut. Other treatments include different types of drugs. These can be taken by mouth, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the affected area. Surgical procedures and other therapies, like physiotherapy or ultrasound, may also be used.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nWe wanted to see how well different treatments improved symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies tested different treatments for periods ranging from less than three months to over six months.\n\nOur main finding is that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. This was based on moderate-certainty evidence, which means we are moderately confident in this finding. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis and summarized their results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of the treatments.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and uses clear language for the most part. The linguistic metrics are excellent. However, a few key improvements are needed to make the summary as clear and helpful as possible for patients before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Make the limitations more specific and meaningful for patients.**\n    -   **The issue:** The current text is too vague.\n    -   **Quote:** \"The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** This doesn't tell the reader *what* was missing. The original research found a critical gap: no studies reported on whether treatments helped people eat or speak normally, which is a primary concern for someone with this condition.\n    -   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, the studies did not measure some effects that matter most to patients. For example, no studies reported whether treatments helped people return to normal eating, chewing, and speaking.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the first key message for immediate clarity.**\n    -   **The issue:** The first bullet point is long and complex for a key message.\n    -   **Quote:** \"We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis. This was based on moderate-certainty evidence, which means we are moderately confident in this finding.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines the finding, a definition, and the evidence certainty into a single, 39-word block. It's the very first thing a reader sees and should be as simple as possible.\n    -   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow cell damage) probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensations. We are moderately confident in this finding.\"\n\n3.  **Reduce repetition between the Key Messages and the Results section.**\n    -   **The issue:** The main finding is stated in almost the exact same words in two different sections.\n    -   **Quote (Key Message):** \"We found that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation...\"\n    -   **Quote (Results):** \"Our main finding is that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation.\"\n    -   **Why it's a problem:** This makes the summary feel repetitive. The key messages should be a distinct, high-level takeaway, not a copy-paste from the main text.\n    -   **Suggested rewrite:** Use the simplified version for the key message (from point #2) and keep the current phrasing in the \"What did we find?\" section. This creates better flow and respects the purpose of each section.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the ideal (P25/P75) or median (P50) ranges for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the average sentence length is excellent at 16.5 words (P25), and the Flesch-Kincaid grade level is 9.6 (P25). The metrics indicate a strong foundation in plain language, with no statistical outliers requiring attention."
