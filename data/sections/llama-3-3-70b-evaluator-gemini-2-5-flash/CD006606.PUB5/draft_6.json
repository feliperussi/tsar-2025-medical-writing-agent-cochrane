  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- This review compares two fertility treatments for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones): maturing eggs in a lab (in vitro maturation, IVM) versus standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body).\n- We are very uncertain if IVM leads to as many live births as IVF.\n- IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks) but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS - a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can cause serious health issues).\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI - a type of assistive reproductive technology where a single sperm is injected into an egg), can be challenging due to the high risk of OHSS. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if IVM followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies were at high risk of bias, which lowers our confidence in the findings. The evidence suggests that IVM may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound), but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to conventional IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe available evidence is highly uncertain. The trials comparing IVM with IVF were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates. Study populations differed markedly, and the interventions were delivered in heterogeneous ways, limiting applicability to the broader target population.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that meets all critical checks for structure, length, and formatting. However, a few key improvements are needed to ensure patients can clearly understand the main findings and limitations. The most critical issue is clarifying the uncertainty around live birth rates. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the uncertainty about live birth rates.** The current wording could be misinterpreted as a finding of 'no difference' when the evidence is actually inconclusive.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence suggests that IVM may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy...\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This phrasing downplays the high uncertainty reported in the original review. For a patient, knowing that the effect is unknown is very different from knowing there is no effect.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are very uncertain if IVM has an effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy rates compared to conventional IVF. The true effect could be better, worse, or the same.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the technical language in the limitations section.** This section contains several terms that would be unfamiliar to a lay reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The trials comparing IVM with IVF were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates. Study populations differed markedly, and the interventions were delivered in heterogeneous ways, limiting applicability to the broader target population.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** Phrases like 'imprecise effect estimates', 'heterogeneous ways', and 'limiting applicability' are research jargon that make the limitations difficult to grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies were very small, which makes the results less reliable. Also, the women in the studies and the treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to apply the findings to all women with PCOS.\"\n\n3. **Refine the definition of PCOS in the key messages.** The current definition is a bit too simple and could be more precise, as it is in the source material.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...(PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones)\"\n   - **Reasoning:** The source material provides a more specific and helpful definition. Using it improves accuracy without adding much complexity.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...(PCOS - a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels)\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. Sentence length, active voice, and pronoun use are excellent. However, the analysis identified one deviation: the number of complex words according to the Dale-Chall list is higher than typical (220, placing it in the P90 range). This supports the editorial feedback to simplify technical language, particularly in the 'Limitations' section, to improve overall clarity for a lay audience."
