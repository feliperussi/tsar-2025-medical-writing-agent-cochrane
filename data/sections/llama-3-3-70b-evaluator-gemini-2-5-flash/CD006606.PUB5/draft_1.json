  "draft": "# Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n**Key Messages**\n- In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS, a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM, a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF, a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth, and IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks), but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can lead to serious health issues).\n- IVM may also reduce the risk of OHSS, but the evidence for its effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound) is uncertain, highlighting the need for more research in this area to fully understand the benefits and risks of IVM compared to IVF.\n- Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IVM compared to IVF for women with PCOS, including its effects on live birth, miscarriage, and other important outcomes, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence, ultimately providing clearer guidance for women with PCOS and healthcare providers.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem? \nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances. Assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are commonly used to help women with PCOS get pregnant.\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS? \nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and ICSI, can be challenging due to the high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications. Additionally, women with PCOS may experience an exaggerated response to fertility medications, resulting in the development of multiple follicles, retrieval of immature eggs, and increased risk of miscarriage.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to find out if in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, they aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes. They also wanted to assess the risk of OHSS and other complications associated with IVM and conventional IVF or ICSI.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing in vitro maturation (IVM) with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find? \nWe found four studies that involved 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The studies were conducted to compare in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias in all domains and in terms of all outcomes, while the other two were at high risk of bias. The population characteristics included subfertile women with PCOS, and the study settings were not specified in terms of countries. The types of interventions and comparisons included IVM before IVF or ICSI versus conventional IVF or ICSI. The duration of the studies was not specified, and there was no overview of study funding sources provided. In vitro maturation may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy, but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared to conventional in vitro fertilisation.\n**Limitations**\nThe available evidence is highly uncertain. The trials comparing IVM or capacitation IVM with IVF under a GnRH‑antagonist protocol were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates. Study populations differed markedly, and the interventions were delivered in heterogeneous ways, limiting applicability to the broader target population. Moreover, the outcomes of interest (live birth and clinical pregnancy) were not consistently reported across all relevant subgroups, and the overall risk of bias was unclear. Consequently, the evidence suffers from serious indirectness, imprecision, and potential bias, preventing reliable conclusions about the true effects.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

Additionally, the text contains overly long and complex sentences, excessive use of passive voice, and a high density of nominalizations and complex vocabulary, making it difficult for a patient audience to understand.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions.\n    *   **Problem:** The Master Style Guide explicitly requires subheadings to be questions (e.g., 'How did we conduct this review?').\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        *   For 'Methods': 'How did we conduct this review?'\n        *   For 'Limitations': 'What are the limitations of this evidence?'\n        *   For 'Currency': 'How up to date is this review?'\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Overly Long and Complex Sentences (especially in Key Messages):**\n    *   **Quote:** \"In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS, a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM, a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF, a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth, and IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks), but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can lead to serious health issues).\"\n    *   **Problem:** This single sentence is 99 words long and attempts to introduce multiple definitions and complex findings at once, making it extremely difficult to read and comprehend for a patient audience.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are trying to get pregnant, we looked at two fertility treatments: in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

This can lead to many follicles developing, immature eggs being retrieved, and a higher chance of miscarriage.\"\n\n4.  **Excessive Passive Voice:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"The studies were conducted to compare in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence uses passive voice (\"were conducted\"), which obscures who performed the action and goes against the Master Style Guide's recommendation for active voice.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The `PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS` confirm these issues.

The `passive_voice` count (20.00) is in the 90th percentile, highlighting the need for more active constructions. These factors contribute to a `flesch_reading_ease` score (35.99) that is in the 25th percentile, suggesting the text is difficult for the target audience.",
