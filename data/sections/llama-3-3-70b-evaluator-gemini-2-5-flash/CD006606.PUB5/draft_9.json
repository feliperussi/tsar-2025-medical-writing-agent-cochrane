  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS, a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM, a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF, a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth.\n- IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks).\n- IVM probably reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can lead to serious health issues).\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as conventional IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, a type of assistive reproductive technology where a single sperm is injected into an egg), can be challenging due to the high risk of OHSS. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if IVM followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies had flaws in their methods that could have produced unreliable results, which lowers our confidence in their findings. We are very uncertain about the effect of IVM on live birth compared to conventional IVF. IVM probably increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to conventional IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included a small number of women, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Second, the women and the specific IVM treatments they received were different across the studies, which means the findings may not apply to everyone with PCOS.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start, but it needs a few key revisions to meet Cochrane standards for clarity and accuracy. Here are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correctly state the certainty of the evidence.** The draft uses 'probably' for findings that the review found to be 'high-certainty'. This understates our confidence in the results and is factually inaccurate.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage...' and 'IVM probably reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)...'\n    *   **Reason:** The term 'probably' is typically used for moderate-certainty evidence. The original review rated this evidence as high-certainty.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Change 'probably increases' to 'increases' and 'probably reduces' to 'reduces'. For example: '**IVM increases** the risk of miscarriage...' and '**IVM reduces** the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)...'\n\n2. **Simplify the first key message.** The first bullet point is one very long sentence (69 words) containing three complex definitions. This makes it difficult for readers to grasp the main takeaway quickly.\n    *   **Problematic text:** '- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS, a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM, a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF, a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth.'\n    *   **Reason:** Key messages must be easy to scan. Packing multiple definitions into a long sentence defeats this purpose.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** State the key message simply in the bullet point, and move the detailed definitions into the main body of the text. For example: '**- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) is as effective as standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for having a baby.**' Then, ensure the full definitions for IVM and IVF are introduced in the body of the text.\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology for the comparison treatment.** The draft switches between 'IVF', 'conventional IVF', and 'conventional IVF or ICSI'. This could confuse readers about whether these are different treatments.\n    *   **Problematic text:** '...as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF)...', '...compared to conventional IVF.', '...with conventional IVF or ICSI...'\n    *   **Reason:** Inconsistent terms for the same concept can make the text harder to follow for a lay audience.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** After defining IVF once, use the simple term 'IVF' consistently throughout the rest of the summary. For example: '...compared to **IVF**.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. Sentence length, use of active voice, and most readability scores are excellent. However, the analysis identified a high number of Dale-Chall complex words (216.0), placing it in the 90th percentile. This metric supports the editorial feedback that simplifying dense definitions, particularly in the key messages, would improve overall clarity for the reader."
