  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (a process called in vitro maturation, or IVM) is as effective as standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for having a baby.\n- IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks).\n- IVM probably reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can lead to serious health issues).\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, a type of assistive reproductive technology where a single sperm is injected into an egg), can be challenging due to the high risk of OHSS. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if IVM followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies were at high risk of bias, which lowers our confidence in the findings. We are very uncertain about the effect of IVM on live birth compared to conventional IVF. IVM probably increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to conventional IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe studies were very small, which makes the results less reliable. Also, the women in the studies and the treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to apply the findings to all women with PCOS.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Explain the term 'risk of bias' in simpler language.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Two of the studies were at high risk of bias, which lowers our confidence in the findings.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The term 'risk of bias' is technical jargon. A patient reading this may not understand that this refers to flaws in the study's methods that could make the results unreliable.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Two of the studies had flaws in their methods that could have produced unreliable results. This is known as a 'high risk of bias', and it lowers our confidence in their findings.\"\n\n**2.**\n\n**2. Use consistent terminology for 'IVF'.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** The draft uses \"standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF)\" in the key messages, but later switches to \"conventional IVF\" in the results section.\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Using different terms for the same concept can confuse readers, making them wonder if 'standard' and 'conventional' IVF are two different procedures.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Choose one term and use it consistently throughout the text. For example, after defining it initially, use \"conventional IVF\" in all subsequent mentions.\n\n**3. Make the limitations more specific and impactful.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The studies were very small, which makes the results less reliable. Also, the women in the studies and the treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to apply the findings to all women with PCOS.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a bit generic. It tells the reader *what* the limitations are but not *why* they matter. The explanation could be stronger and more directly linked to the uncertainty of the results.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included a small number of women, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Second, the women and the specific IVM treatments they received were different across the studies, which means the findings may not apply to everyone with PCOS.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics, including readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 9.0), sentence length (16.6 words/sentence), and passive voice (5 instances), fall within the best quartile for PLS texts. This indicates the draft is already very readable and well-structured, and the recommended edits focus on improving conceptual clarity rather than fixing structural or vocabulary issues."
