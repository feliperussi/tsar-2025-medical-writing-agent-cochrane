  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We compared two fertility treatments for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones): in vitro maturation (IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a lab) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body).\n- We are very uncertain if IVM leads to as many live births as IVF.\n- IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks) but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS - a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can cause serious health issues).\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI - a type of assistive reproductive technology where a single sperm is injected into an egg), can be challenging due to the high risk of OHSS. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if IVM followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. We found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments.\n\nWhat did we find?\nIVM may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound), but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to conventional IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe available evidence is highly uncertain. The trials comparing IVM with IVF were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates. Study populations differed markedly, and the interventions were delivered in heterogeneous ways, limiting applicability to the broader target population.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and the language is generally clear, but it needs a few structural changes to make it easier for readers to follow. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the first key message.** The first bullet point is a single 49-word sentence that introduces and defines three separate concepts, which is a lot for a reader to take in at once.\n    *   **Original:** 'We compared two fertility treatments for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones): in vitro maturation (IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a lab) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of the assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this up to reduce the cognitive load. For example: 'This review compares two fertility treatments for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): maturing eggs in a lab (IVM) versus standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).' You can then provide the more detailed definitions in the main text.\n\n2. **Separate the 'Methods' from the 'Results'.** The methods section currently includes information about what you found, which can confuse the reader's sense of flow.\n    *   **Original:** 'How did we conduct this review? We searched for studies... We found four studies that involved 810 women...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Move the sentence about the number of studies and participants to the 'What did we find?' section. The methods section should only describe the process, for example: 'We searched for studies comparing IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n3. **Add important context to the 'Results' section.** The results section is missing key details about the **studies you found**, which is important for understanding the limitations of the evidence.\n    *   **Original:** 'What did we find? IVM may make little to no difference to live birth...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Start the results section by describing the evidence base first. For example: 'We found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS. Two of the studies were at high risk of bias, which lowers our confidence in the findings. The evidence suggests that IVM may make little to no difference to live birth...'\n\n",
