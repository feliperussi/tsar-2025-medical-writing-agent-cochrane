  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones) trying to get pregnant, we compared two fertility treatments: in vitro maturation (IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a lab) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body).\n- We are uncertain if IVM leads to as many live births as IVF.\n- IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage, but it reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS - a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can cause serious health issues).\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances. Assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are commonly used to help women with PCOS get pregnant.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and ICSI, can be challenging due to the high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications. Additionally, women with PCOS may experience an exaggerated response to fertility medications, resulting in the development of multiple follicles, retrieval of immature eggs, and increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, they aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes. They also wanted to assess the risk of OHSS and other complications associated with IVM and conventional IVF or ICSI.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing in vitro maturation (IVM) with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. The studies compared in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias, while the other two were at high risk of bias. IVM may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy, but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with PCOS compared to conventional in vitro fertilisation.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in these results. The studies we found included only a small number of women, which makes the findings less certain. Also, the women in the studies and the specific treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to know if the results apply to all women with PCOS. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the true effects of IVM.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

However, the summary is not approved due to three main issues that affect clarity for a patient reader. First, the language used to describe the main findings does not accurately reflect the certainty of the evidence; it downplays both the high uncertainty for live births and the high certainty for miscarriage and OHSS risks. Second, several sentences are overly complex and noun-heavy, using technical terms without clear explanation, which makes them difficult to understand. Finally, the limitations section is too generic and could be more specific about why the evidence is uncertain. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows higher-than-typical use of complex words, long words, and noun-based phrases (nominalizations).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. The summary performs very well on sentence-level metrics, with sentence length and most readability scores falling into the best quartile (P25/P75), indicating good structural readability. However, there is a significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and word choice. Six key metrics are in the P90 range, including nominalization (27.0), total nouns (169.0), SMOG index (14.2), and counts for complex and long words. This pattern suggests that while sentences are short, they are dense with complex, technical, and noun-heavy language, which can hinder reader comprehension."
