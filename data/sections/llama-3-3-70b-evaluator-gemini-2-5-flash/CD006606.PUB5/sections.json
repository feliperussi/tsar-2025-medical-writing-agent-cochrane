  "key_messages": [
    "In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS, a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM, a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF, a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth, and IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks), but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can lead to serious health issues).",
    "IVM may also reduce the risk of OHSS, but the evidence for its effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound) is uncertain, highlighting the need for more research in this area to fully understand the benefits and risks of IVM compared to IVF.",
    "Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IVM compared to IVF for women with PCOS, including its effects on live birth, miscarriage, and other important outcomes, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence, ultimately providing clearer guidance for women with PCOS and healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances. Assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are commonly used to help women with PCOS get pregnant."

      "subheading": "What are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?",
      "content": "Current fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and ICSI, can be challenging due to the high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications. Additionally, women with PCOS may experience an exaggerated response to fertility medications, resulting in the development of multiple follicles, retrieval of immature eggs, and increased risk of miscarriage."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out if in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, they aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes. They also wanted to assess the risk of OHSS and other complications associated with IVM and conventional IVF or ICSI."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found four studies that involved 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The studies were conducted to compare in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias in all domains and in terms of all outcomes, while the other two were at high risk of bias. The population characteristics included subfertile women with PCOS, and the study settings were not specified in terms of countries. The types of interventions and comparisons included IVM before IVF or ICSI versus conventional IVF or ICSI. The duration of the studies was not specified, and there was no overview of study funding sources provided. In vitro maturation may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy, but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared to conventional in vitro fertilisation."

  "limitations": "The available evidence is highly uncertain. The trials comparing IVM or capacitation IVM with IVF under a GnRHâ€‘antagonist protocol were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates. Study populations differed markedly, and the interventions were delivered in heterogeneous ways, limiting applicability to the broader target population. Moreover, the outcomes of interest (live birth and clinical pregnancy) were not consistently reported across all relevant subgroups, and the overall risk of bias was unclear. Consequently, the evidence suffers from serious indirectness, imprecision, and potential bias, preventing reliable conclusions about the true effects.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
