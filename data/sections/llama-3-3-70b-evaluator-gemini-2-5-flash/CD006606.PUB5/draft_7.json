  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth.\n- We are very uncertain if IVM has an effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy rates compared to conventional IVF - the true effect could be better, worse, or the same.\n- IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage (the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks) but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS - a condition where the ovaries become overstimulated and can lead to serious health issues).\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI - a type of assistive reproductive technology where a single sperm is injected into an egg), can be challenging due to the high risk of OHSS. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if IVM followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies were at high risk of bias, which lowers our confidence in the findings. We are very uncertain about the effect of IVM on live birth and clinical pregnancy rates compared to conventional IVF. IVM probably increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to conventional IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe studies were very small, which makes the results less reliable. Also, the women in the studies and the treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to apply the findings to all women with PCOS.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it is not approved because the 'Key messages' section, which is the most critical part of the summary, has significant clarity issues that will confuse readers. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to make the summary ready for publication:\n\n1. **Simplify the first key message.** The first bullet point is one very long sentence (68 words) that tries to define three complex terms at once, making it difficult to understand.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels) trying to get pregnant, it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab (in vitro maturation, IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a laboratory) is as effective as in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body) for achieving live birth.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is too long and dense for a key message. It overwhelms the reader by defining PCOS, IVM, and IVF all at once. Key messages must be clear and easy to scan.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (a process called IVM) is as effective as standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for having a baby. You can then define these terms in the main text.\"\n\n2. **Remove repetition in the key messages.** The first two bullet points say the same thing: that the effect of IVM on live birth is uncertain. This is redundant and prevents other key findings from being highlighted.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- ...it is unclear whether egg maturation in the lab...is as effective as...IVF for achieving live birth.\"\n   AND\n   \"- We are very uncertain if IVM has an effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy rates compared to conventional IVF...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** These two points repeat the same information. This space could be used to communicate the other important findings about miscarriage and OHSS, which are currently combined into the third bullet point.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Combine these into one clear message about the uncertainty of live birth. Then, use separate bullet points for the other main findings. For example:\n   - We are very uncertain if IVM improves the chance of having a baby compared to IVF.\n   - IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage.\n   - IVM probably reduces the risk of a serious complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\"\n\n3. **Avoid jargon in the results section.** The results use the term \"clinical pregnancy rates\" without explaining what it means to a lay audience.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We are very uncertain about the effect of IVM on live birth and clinical pregnancy rates compared to conventional IVF.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Clinical pregnancy\" is medical jargon. While \"live birth\" is easily understood, adding an undefined technical term complicates the main finding. The most important outcome for the reader is having a baby.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Focus on the most important outcome for patients. We suggest simplifying this to: 'We are very uncertain if IVM changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.'\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is very well-written overall, with excellent readability scores. However, the analysis shows a high number of complex words ('complex_words_dc' is 221, which is higher than 90% of typical summaries). The suggestions above will help simplify the vocabulary in the most critical sections, making the key findings clearer to the reader.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 88.9% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style (e.g., low passive voice, good sentence length). However, the analysis identified one deviation: the number of complex words unfamiliar to a lay audience (complex_words_dc) is in the 90th percentile. This suggests that while the structure is sound, the vocabulary could be simplified in key areas to improve reader comprehension, supporting the editorial feedback to clarify jargon and dense definitions."
