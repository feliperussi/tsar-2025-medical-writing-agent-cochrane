  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are trying to get pregnant, we looked at two fertility treatments: in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF). PCOS is a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones. IVM is a process where eggs are matured in a lab, while IVF involves fertilising an egg with sperm outside the body. Our review found it's unclear if IVM is as effective as IVF for achieving a live birth. However, IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage (losing a pregnancy before 20 weeks) but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a condition where ovaries become overstimulated and can cause serious health issues.\n- While IVM may reduce the risk of OHSS, the evidence on its effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound) is uncertain. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of IVM compared to IVF.\n- Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IVM compared to IVF for women with PCOS, including its effects on live birth, miscarriage, and other important outcomes, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence, ultimately providing clearer guidance for women with PCOS and healthcare providers.\n\n**What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?**\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances. Assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are commonly used to help women with PCOS get pregnant.\n\n**What are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?**\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and ICSI, can be challenging due to the high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications. Also, women with PCOS might react strongly to fertility medications. This can lead to many follicles developing, immature eggs being retrieved, and a higher chance of miscarriage.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to find out if in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, they aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes. They also wanted to assess the risk of OHSS and other complications associated with IVM and conventional IVF or ICSI.\n\n**How did we conduct this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing in vitro maturation (IVM) with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. The studies compared in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found four studies that involved 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias in all domains and in terms of all outcomes, while the other two were at high risk of bias. In vitro maturation may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy, but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared to conventional in vitro fertilisation.\n\n**What are the limitations of this evidence?**\nThe available evidence is highly uncertain. The trials comparing IVM or capacitation IVM with IVF under a GnRH-antagonist protocol were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates. Study populations differed markedly, and the interventions were delivered in heterogeneous ways, limiting applicability to the broader target population. Moreover, the outcomes of interest (live birth and clinical pregnancy) were not consistently reported across all relevant subgroups, and the overall risk of bias was unclear. Consequently, the evidence suffers from serious indirectness, imprecision, and potential bias, preventing reliable conclusions about the true effects.\n\n**How up to date is this review?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, and all the required information is here. However, the summary needs significant revision to make it accessible for a lay audience. The main issue is the use of overly technical language and complex sentence structures, which makes key sections difficult to understand. The 'Limitations' section, in particular, reads like a technical summary and needs to be completely rewritten in plain language. Focusing on simplifying vocabulary and breaking down long, noun-heavy sentences will greatly improve clarity for patients and their families.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Rewrite the 'Limitations' section in plain language.**\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The available evidence is highly uncertain. The trials comparing IVM or capacitation IVM with IVF under a GnRH-antagonist protocol were very small, leading to imprecise effect estimates... Consequently, the evidence suffers from serious indirectness, imprecision, and potential bias, preventing reliable conclusions about the true effects.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This section is filled with technical jargon ('capacitation IVM', 'GnRH-antagonist protocol', 'imprecise effect estimates', 'indirectness') that is meaningless to a non-specialist reader. It fails to explain the limitations in an understandable way.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in these results. The studies we found included only a small number of women, which makes the findings less certain. Also, the women in the studies and the specific treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to know if the results apply to all women with PCOS. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the true effects of IVM.\"\n\n**2. Replace complex and technical words with simpler alternatives.**\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"...subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** While accurate, this phrasing is very clinical. Simpler, more common words would make it easier to read.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments.\"\n\n**3. Break down long, complex sentences and use active verbs.**\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IVM compared to IVF for women with PCOS, including its effects on live birth, miscarriage, and other important outcomes, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence, ultimately providing clearer guidance for women with PCOS and healthcare providers.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence is 58 words long and relies on abstract nouns ('effectiveness', 'uncertainty', 'limitations', 'guidance') instead of direct verbs. This makes it dense and hard to follow.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"More high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mix of good and problematic features. While the average sentence length (17.6 words) and use of pronouns are excellent and fall within the best quartile for PLS texts, there are significant deviations from typical patterns in vocabulary. Five key metrics—nominalization, SMOG index, and counts of complex and long words—are far outside the typical range ('Beyond P90'). This indicates that while sentences are short, the words used within them are too complex and technical for a lay audience, severely impacting readability."
