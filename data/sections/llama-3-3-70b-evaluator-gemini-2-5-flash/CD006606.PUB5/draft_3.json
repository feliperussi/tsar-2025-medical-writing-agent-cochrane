  "draft": "Is egg maturation in the lab as effective as IVF for women with PCOS trying to get pregnant?\n\nKey messages:\n- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones) who are trying to get pregnant, we compared two fertility treatments: in vitro maturation (IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a lab) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body). We found it's unclear if IVM is as effective as IVF for achieving a live birth. However, IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage (losing a pregnancy before 20 weeks) but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS - a condition where ovaries become overstimulated and can cause serious health issues).\n- IVM may reduce the risk of OHSS, but the evidence on its effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound) is uncertain. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of IVM compared to IVF.\n- Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IVM compared to IVF for women with PCOS, including its effects on live birth, miscarriage, and other important outcomes.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a common health condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women. It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances. Assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are commonly used to help women with PCOS get pregnant.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF and ICSI, can be challenging due to the high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications. Additionally, women with PCOS may experience an exaggerated response to fertility medications, resulting in the development of multiple follicles, retrieval of immature eggs, and increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by IVF or ICSI is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. Specifically, they aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with conventional IVF or ICSI in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes. They also wanted to assess the risk of OHSS and other complications associated with IVM and conventional IVF or ICSI.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing in vitro maturation (IVM) with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. The studies compared in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias, while the other two were at high risk of bias. IVM may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy, but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with PCOS compared to conventional in vitro fertilisation.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in these results. The studies we found included only a small number of women, which makes the findings less certain. Also, the women in the studies and the specific treatments they received were very different from each other. This makes it hard to know if the results apply to all women with PCOS. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the true effects of IVM.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary needs significant editing to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. The main issues are the use of overly complex vocabulary and long, dense sentences that pack too much information together. While the critical checks for accuracy and completeness passed, the readability is hampered by its technical style. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break Down Overly Long and Complex Sentences.** Some sentences try to convey too many ideas at once, making them difficult to follow. This is most critical in the key messages.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS - a condition where women have irregular periods and higher levels of male hormones) who are trying to get pregnant, we compared two fertility treatments: in vitro maturation (IVM - a process where eggs are matured in a lab) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF - a type of assistive reproductive technology where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body). We found it's unclear if IVM is as effective as IVF for achieving a live birth. However, IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage (losing a pregnancy before 20 weeks) but reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS - a condition where ovaries become overstimulated and can cause serious health issues).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This single bullet point is nearly 100 words long. It defines four different concepts (PCOS, IVM, IVF, OHSS) and presents three separate findings. This is overwhelming for the reader.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this into smaller, more focused points:\n     \"- For women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) trying to get pregnant, we compared maturing eggs in a lab (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\n     - We are uncertain if IVM leads to as many live births as IVF.\n     - IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage, but it reduces the risk of a serious complication from fertility drugs called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\"\n\n2. **Replace Technical Jargon with Simpler, Everyday Language.** The text uses words that are common in research but may be unfamiliar to patients, making the findings harder to grasp.\n   - **Problematic Phrase:** \"...reduces the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The word \"incidence\" is clinical jargon. A simpler word like \"risk\" or \"chance\" is more appropriate for a plain language summary.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS...\" or \"...makes moderate or severe OHSS less likely.\"\n\n3. **Use Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Nominalizations).** The summary often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences less direct and more academic in tone.\n   - **Problematic Phrase:** \"...resulting in the development of multiple follicles, retrieval of immature eggs, and increased risk of miscarriage.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"development of\" and \"retrieval of\" are less active and engaging than using their verb forms. This style makes the text feel dense.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...causing many follicles to develop, which means immature eggs are retrieved, and increasing the risk of miscarriage.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your draft's vocabulary is statistically complex. The SMOG index (15.2) suggests it requires more than 15 years of education to read easily. This is driven by a high number of complex and long words (all metrics in the 'Beyond P90' category), confirming the need to simplify word choices. The high number of nominalizations (29, where under 13 is typical) supports the recommendation to use more direct verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mix of good and problematic features. While some readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid are within a good range (P25), the summary deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for complex words (SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words), long words, and nominalizations are all 'Beyond P90', indicating the text relies too heavily on technical jargon and noun-heavy phrases, which can make it difficult for a lay audience to understand."
