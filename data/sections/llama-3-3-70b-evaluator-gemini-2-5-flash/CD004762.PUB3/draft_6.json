  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey Messages\n- Medicines like mexiletine (a type of sodium channel blocker that helps relax muscles) and lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness) may reduce muscle stiffness for some people with myotonic disorders. However, this finding is based on evidence that is not strong, so we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems (gastrointestinal symptoms), feeling tired (lethargy), and headache. But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause serious disability and affect people's health in those with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects the whole body and can also cause muscles to get weaker over time and other problems like irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work to reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. We also looked for any unwanted side effects. We focused on the best available evidence from studies called randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing medicines for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy:\n- We found no good evidence that any medicine improved the main symptoms of muscle stiffness.\n- Mexiletine probably helps muscles relax faster after gripping, but we are uncertain if it improves quality of life.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and probably improves quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for structure, accuracy, and length. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for patients. The key messages are the most important part of the summary, and they currently don't clearly state that the benefits of treatment were mainly found for one type of myotonic disorder, not both. This could give false hope to some readers. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and use more complex vocabulary than needed, making them harder to follow. Addressing these three areas will significantly improve the summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the Key Message for Different Conditions:** The first key message groups findings for two different conditions (myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotmnia), but the review found benefits for only one. This is potentially misleading.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Medicines like mexiletine... and lamotrigine... may reduce muscle stiffness for some people with myotonic disorders.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Specify which group benefited. For example: \"For people with a condition called non-dystrophic myotonia, the medicines mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce muscle stiffness. We did not find good evidence that any medicine helped with stiffness for people with myotonic dystrophy.\"\n\n2. **Simplify Definitions and Remove Jargon:** The definitions provided for the medicines in the key messages are clunky and contain jargon that isn't essential for the main takeaway.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness) may reduce muscle stiffness...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** The definition is circular and can be removed. Simply naming the medicine is enough for the key message. For example: \"Two medicines, mexiletine and lamotrigine, may reduce muscle stiffness...\"\n\n3. **Replace Wordy and Noun-Heavy Phrases:** Several sentences are longer and more and more formal than they need to be. Using more direct verbs and simpler phrasing would make them easier to read.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this more directly. For example: \"However, because the evidence is not strong, we are uncertain about the true benefits and harms of these treatments.\"\n\nThe linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile. Sentence structure is excellent, with short sentences (18.1 words) and low passive voice (6 instances). However, the analysis identified significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. The counts for nouns (160), Dale-Chall complex words (223), and long words (187) are all in the 90th percentile range, indicating the word choice is more complex and formal than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify wordy phrases and reduce jargon where possible.",
