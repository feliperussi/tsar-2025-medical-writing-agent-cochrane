  "draft": "# What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that some medicines, such as mexiletine (a type of sodium channel blocker that helps relax muscles) and lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness), may reduce muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders, but the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning that we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (problems with the stomach and intestines), lethargy (feeling tired), and headache, but we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n**Introduction**\n### What is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition characterized by abnormal delayed relaxation of skeletal muscles, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life, as well as to assess the potential adverse events associated with these treatments.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing drug treatments for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nThis review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind randomised controlled trials involving a total of 392 participants, 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. The studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. The primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, and secondary outcomes included relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. The review found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, and may improve quality of life. However, it may cause adverse events such as gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache. The review also found that lamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but may cause adverse events such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues with subheading formatting and significant clarity problems. The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions, which is a direct violation of the Master Style Guide. Furthermore, the text contains overly long and complex sentences, and uses technical vocabulary that would be challenging for a lay audience. For example, the first key message is a single 49-word sentence, and the introduction uses terms like 'systemic neuromuscular disorder' and 'progressive myopathy' without sufficient simplification. There is also a tendency towards wordy and noun-heavy constructions, such as 'assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment' instead of simpler, more active phrasing. These issues are strongly supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the text deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns for readability (e.g., SMOG Index, Gunning Fog Index) and vocabulary complexity (e.g., complex words, long words, noun count).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of features in the best quartile. However, 33.3% of features are in the P90 range and 16.7% are Beyond P90, highlighting significant deviations. Specifically, the text shows high complexity in readability indices such as SMOG Index (15.12, Beyond P90), Gunning Fog Index (20.31, P90), LIX (61.85, P90), RIX (9.04, P90), and Dale-Chall Readability (8.39, P90), suggesting it is much harder to read than typical PLS texts. Vocabulary complexity is also a major concern, with high counts for complex words (154.00, Beyond P90), long words (217.00, Beyond P90), and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words (260.00, P90). Additionally, the text is noun-heavy (185.00 nouns, P90), which can contribute to a less direct and harder-to-understand style."
