  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey Messages\n- We don't fully understand how different medicines affect muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders like myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. This is because there isn't enough strong evidence. However, some studies suggest that mexiletine and lamotrigine might reduce myotonia, even though they can cause side effects like stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Some people with non-dystrophic myotonia may experience improvement in their symptoms with mexiletine or lamotrigine treatment, but it is unclear if these benefits apply to everyone, and more research is needed to understand who is most likely to benefit from these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on investigating the effects of these and other medicines in larger, well-designed studies, including their potential long-term benefits and harms, to provide clearer answers for people with myotonic disorders and their healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is when your muscles relax slowly, causing stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and tiredness. This can make daily life very difficult for people with myotonic disorders like non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias and cataracts.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life, as well as to assess the potential adverse events associated with these treatments.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched several electronic databases, including the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, on 29 March 2023. We also looked for other relevant studies and contacted experts and drug manufacturers.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the information?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes (efficacy measures such as reduction in myotonic episodes and tolerability/adverse events), and follow-up duration. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nHow sure are we about the evidence?\nThe confidence in the body of evidence for each drug was rated using the GRADE framework. Domains considered included risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty, providing a transparent basis for conclusions about efficacy and tolerability.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind randomised controlled trials involving a total of 392 participants, 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. The studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. The primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, and secondary outcomes included relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. The review found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, and may improve quality of life. However, it is unclear if mexiletine has an effect on myotonia in people with myotonic dystrophy. Lamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence is not certain. Other medications, such as phenytoin and imipramine, may have little to no effect on myotonia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs significant revision to make it truly accessible for a lay audience. The language is often too academic and technical, which could prevent patients from understanding the key findings.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to make this summary clearer and more readable:\n\n**1. Simplify the Overly Technical 'Methods' Section**\n\nThe sections explaining how the review was done are filled with jargon that isn't meaningful to a general reader. This technical detail can be intimidating and obscure the main points.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis.\" and \"The confidence in the body of evidence for each drug was rated using the GRADE framework. Domains considered included risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\"\n- **Reasoning:** Phrases like 'pooled effect estimates', 'random-effects meta-analysis', and 'indirectness' are research terms. Patients need to know *what* you did, not the statistical name for the process.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine the 'How did we collect...' and 'How sure are we...' sections into a single, simpler paragraph. For example: \"We found and analyzed 17 studies. We compared the effects of different medicines against a placebo (a dummy treatment). We were interested in whether the medicines reduced muscle stiffness and improved quality of life, and we also looked for any unwanted side effects. We then rated our confidence in the evidence from the studies.\"\n\n**2. Replace Complex Medical Terms with Simpler Language**\n\nThe summary uses several medical terms without explanation, making it difficult for readers without a clinical background to follow.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias and cataracts.\"\n- **Reasoning:** This single sentence contains five distinct technical terms. While some are necessary, they are presented too densely.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this down and explain the terms in plain language. For example: \"Myotonic dystrophy affects the whole body, not just the muscles. It can cause muscles to weaken over time and lead to other health problems, like an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or cloudy areas in the lens of the eye (cataracts).\"\n\n**3. Use Active Voice and Strong Verbs to Improve Clarity**\n\nMany sentences are written in a passive, academic style. Using a more direct, active voice makes the text easier to read and understand.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"The studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders.\"\n- **Reasoning:** The passive voice (\"studies were conducted\") is indirect. It's clearer to state who did the action ('we' the review authors).\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We looked at studies that tested how well different drug treatments worked for myotonia and what side effects they had.\"\n\nRevising these areas will significantly improve the clarity and readability of the summary for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a MODERATE conformity with typical PLS patterns. While several metrics fall within the best quartile (e.g., sentence length), there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. Five metrics are rated 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text has a much higher density of complex words, long words, and nouns than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The high SMOG Index (17.07) and Dale-Chall score (7.71) confirm that the vocabulary is too advanced for a general audience, supporting the need to simplify technical terms and sentence structures."
