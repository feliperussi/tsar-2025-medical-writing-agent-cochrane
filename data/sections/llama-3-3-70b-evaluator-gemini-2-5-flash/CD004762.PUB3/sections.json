  "key_messages": [
    "The effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia, are not well understood due to a lack of robust evidence, but some studies suggest that mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce myotonia, although they can cause unwanted effects like gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache.",
    "Some people with non-dystrophic myotonia may experience improvement in their symptoms with mexiletine or lamotrigine treatment, but it is unclear if these benefits apply to everyone, and more research is needed to understand who is most likely to benefit from these treatments.",
    "Future research should focus on investigating the effects of these and other medicines in larger, well-designed studies, including their potential long-term benefits and harms, to provide clearer answers for people with myotonic disorders and their healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is myotonia and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Myotonia is a condition characterized by abnormal delayed relaxation of skeletal muscles, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life, as well as to assess the potential adverse events associated with these treatments."

    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating drug treatments for myotonia. Search terms combined disease descriptors (\"myotonia\", \"myotonic disorder\") with drug-related keywords (\"treatment\", \"therapy\", specific drug names). No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional studies."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes (efficacy measures such as reduction in myotonic episodes and tolerability/adverse events), and follow‑up duration. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated using random‑effects meta‑analysis."

      "subheading": "Evidence Grading",
      "content": "The confidence in the body of evidence for each drug was rated using the GRADE framework. Domains considered included risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty, providing a transparent basis for conclusions about efficacy and tolerability."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind randomised controlled trials involving a total of 392 participants, 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. The studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. The primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, and secondary outcomes included relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. The review found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, and may improve quality of life. However, it is unclear if mexiletine has an effect on myotonia in people with myotonic dystrophy. Lamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence is not certain. Other medications, such as phenytoin and imipramine, may have little to no effect on myotonia."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
