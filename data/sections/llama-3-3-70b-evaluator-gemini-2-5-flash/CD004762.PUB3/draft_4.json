  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey Messages\n- Medicines like mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce muscle stiffness for some people with myotonic disorders. However, this finding is based on evidence that is not strong, so we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, feeling tired, and headache. But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects the whole body and can also cause muscles getting weaker over time and other problems like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to find out how well drug treatments work and what unwanted effects they might have for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing drug treatments for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy:\n- We found no good evidence that any drug improved the main symptoms of muscle stiffness.\n- Mexiletine likely helps muscles relax faster after gripping, but we are uncertain if it improves quality of life.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on these 3 key improvements:\n\n1. **Explain medical terms in the introduction.** Some terms may be unfamiliar to readers.\n    *   **The text says:** \"...other problems like arrhythmias and cataracts.\"\n    *   **The issue:** A reader may not know what 'arrhythmias' or 'cataracts' are.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Briefly define these terms in parentheses. For example: \"...other problems like irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts).\"\n\n2. **Replace clinical jargon with simpler, everyday words.** This makes the text more accessible.\n    *   **The text says:** \"It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders...\"\n    *   **The issue:** 'Morbidity' is clinical jargon that doesn't add much meaning here for a lay reader and can be confusing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use a simpler phrase. For example: \"It can cause serious disability and affect people's health...\"\n\n3. **Use consistent language to describe the certainty of evidence.** This helps readers understand how confident we are in the findings.\n    *   **The text says:** \"Mexiletine **likely** helps muscles relax faster...\" but later says \"Mexiletine **probably** reduces muscle stiffness...\"\n    *   **The issue:** Using different words ('likely' vs. 'probably') for findings with a similar level of certainty (moderate certainty in the source abstract) can be confusing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Choose one term for moderate-certainty evidence and use it consistently. For example, use 'probably' in both places: \"Mexiletine **probably** helps muscles relax faster...\"\n\nThese changes will help address the high number of long words noted in the evaluation report, making an already good summary even more reader-friendly.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. The primary area for improvement is vocabulary, as the 'long_words' count (180) is higher than typical (P90), suggesting some complex or technical terms could be simplified."
