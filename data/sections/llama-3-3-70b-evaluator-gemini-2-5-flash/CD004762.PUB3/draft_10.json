  "draft": "# What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n**Key Messages**\n- The effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia, are not well understood due to a lack of robust evidence, but some studies suggest that mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce myotonia, although they can cause unwanted effects like gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache.\n- Some people with non-dystrophic myotonia may experience improvement in their symptoms with mexiletine or lamotrigine treatment, but it is unclear if these benefits apply to everyone, and more research is needed to understand who is most likely to benefit from these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on investigating the effects of these and other medicines in larger, well-designed studies, including their potential long-term benefits and harms, to provide clearer answers for people with myotonic disorders and their healthcare providers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition characterized by abnormal delayed relaxation of skeletal muscles, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life, as well as to assess the potential adverse events associated with these treatments.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating drug treatments for myotonia. Search terms combined disease descriptors (\"myotonia\", \"myotonic disorder\") with drug-related keywords (\"treatment\", \"therapy\", specific drug names). No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional studies.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes (efficacy measures such as reduction in myotonic episodes and tolerability/adverse events), and follow‑up duration. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated using random‑effects meta‑analysis.\n### Evidence Grading\nThe confidence in the body of evidence for each drug was rated using the GRADE framework. Domains considered included risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty, providing a transparent basis for conclusions about efficacy and tolerability.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nThis review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind randomised controlled trials involving a total of 392 participants, 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. The studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. The primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, and secondary outcomes included relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. The review found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, and may improve quality of life. However, it is unclear if mexiletine has an effect on myotonia in people with myotonic dystrophy. Lamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence is not certain. Other medications, such as phenytoin and imipramine, may have little to no effect on myotonia.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues in factual accuracy and subheading formatting, alongside significant clarity and style problems. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy/Incompleteness in Search Strategy:** The 'Search Strategy' section in the draft omits crucial details from the original abstract, such as specific databases searched (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP), the exact search date (29 March 2023), and additional search methods (handsearching grey literature, contacting experts and manufacturers). This misrepresents the comprehensiveness of the review's search. \n2.  **Incorrect Subheading Format:** The subheadings within the 'Methods' section ('Search Strategy', 'Data Extraction and Synthesis', 'Evidence Grading') are not phrased as questions, which directly violates the Cochrane style guide for PLS documents.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Improve Factual Accuracy and Completeness in Search Strategy:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"We performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating drug treatments for myotonia. Search terms combined disease descriptors (\\\"myotonia\\\", \\\"myotonic disorder\\\") with drug-related keywords (\\\"treatment\\\", \\\"therapy\\\", specific drug names). No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional studies.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This section is incomplete and inaccurate compared to the original abstract. It misses specific databases, the search date, and other search methods (handsearching, contacting experts/manufacturers). This is a factual inaccuracy and lacks important context for the reader about how comprehensive the search was.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched several electronic databases, including the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, on 29 March 2023. We also looked for other relevant studies and contacted experts and drug manufacturers.\"\n2.  **Reformat Methods Subheadings as Questions:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"### Search Strategy\", \"### Data Extraction and Synthesis\", \"### Evidence Grading\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The master style guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to improve readability and engagement for patients.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        -   \"### How did we search for studies?\"\n        -   \"### How did we collect and combine the information?\"\n        -   \"### How sure are we about the evidence?\"\n3.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Complexity, and Use More Active Voice:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"The effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia, are not well understood due to a lack of robust evidence, but some studies suggest that mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce myotonia, although they can cause unwanted effects like gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is excessively long (49 words) and uses passive constructions (\\\"are not well understood\\\") and nominalizations (\\\"lack of robust evidence\\\", \\\"unwanted effects\\\"), making it dense and difficult for a patient to quickly grasp the main point.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We don't fully understand how different medicines affect muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders like myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. This is because there isn't enough strong evidence. However, some studies suggest that mexiletine and lamotrigine might reduce myotonia, even though they can cause side effects like stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\"\n4.  **Simplify Vocabulary and Reduce Formal Language:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Myotonia is a condition characterized by abnormal delayed relaxation of skeletal muscles, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** Phrases like \\\"characterized by,\\\" \\\"abnormal delayed relaxation,\\\" and \\\"significant disability and morbidity\\\" are overly formal and technical for a plain language summary, hindering patient understanding.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Myotonia is when your muscles relax slowly, causing stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and tiredness. This can make daily life very difficult for people with myotonic disorders like non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The PLS evaluation results strongly support these recommendations. The draft's readability scores are low (Flesch Reading Ease is in the P10 range), while grade levels (Flesch-Kincaid, ARI, Gunning Fog, SMOG, Coleman-Liau, LIX, RIX, Dale-Chall) are consistently high (P75, P90, or Beyond P90), indicating the text is too difficult. There is a significant overuse of passive voice (Beyond P90), nominalization (P90), and nouns (Beyond P90), contributing to a dense and less direct writing style. Additionally, the text contains a high number of complex and long words (Beyond P90 for all three metrics), further increasing its complexity.",
