  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey Messages\n- Medicines like mexiletine (a type of sodium channel blocker that helps relax muscles) and lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness) may reduce muscle stiffness for some people with myotonic disorders. However, this finding is based on evidence that is not strong, so we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems (gastrointestinal symptoms), feeling tired (lethargy), and headache. But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause serious disability and affect people's health in those with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects the whole body and can also cause muscles to get weaker over time and other problems like irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to find out how well drug treatments work and what unwanted effects they might have for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing drug treatments for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy:\n- We found no good evidence that any drug improved the main symptoms of muscle stiffness.\n- Mexiletine probably helps muscles relax faster after gripping, but we are uncertain if it improves quality of life.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent sentence structure, but it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and correct a factual inaccuracy before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Finding for Lamotrigine and Quality of Life:** The draft currently understates the certainty of this finding, which is a factual error.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The source abstract states this is 'moderate-certainty evidence' and that quality of life is 'likely to improve'. Using \"may\" incorrectly lowers the confidence level presented to the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and **probably improves** quality of life.\"\n\n2. **Simplify Noun-Heavy and Technical Phrasing:** Some sections are dense with technical terms and nouns, making them hard to read. This is particularly true in the introduction.\n   - **Problematic sentences:** \"The review authors aimed to find out how well drug treatments work and what unwanted effects they might have for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This passage is repetitive and uses complex phrases like \"clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders.\" It relies heavily on nouns instead of active verbs, which can tire the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well different medicines work to reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. We also looked for any unwanted side effects. We focused on the best available evidence from studies called randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\"\n\n3. **Use Simpler, More Consistent Terminology:** The draft switches between simple and technical terms for the same concept.\n   - **Problematic terms:** The text uses \"medicines\" in the Key Messages but then switches to the more formal \"drug treatment\" in the introduction and other sections.\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Using the simplest term consistently makes the summary easier for a lay audience to follow. \"Medicines\" is more accessible than \"drug treatment.\"\n   - **Suggested action:** Replace all instances of \"drug treatment\" with \"medicines\" for consistency and clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, particularly in its sentence structure. Metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (19.21) and 'passive_voice' (5 instances) are in the best quartile, indicating short, active sentences. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The number of 'nouns' (166), Dale-Chall 'complex_words' (229), and 'long_words' (190) are all in the P90 range, suggesting the text is denser and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback focuses on simplifying this vocabulary to improve readability."
