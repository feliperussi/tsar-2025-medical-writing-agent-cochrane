  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that some medicines, such as mexiletine (a type of sodium channel blocker that helps relax muscles) and lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness), may reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (problems with the stomach and intestines), lethargy (feeling tired), and headache. But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic condition that can also cause progressive muscle weakness and other systemic problems like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life, as well as to assess the potential adverse events associated with these treatments.\n\n**Methods**\n### What methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing drug treatments for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nThis review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind randomized controlled trials involving a total of 392 participants, 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. The studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. The primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, and secondary outcomes included relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. We found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, and may improve quality of life. However, it may cause adverse events such as gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache. We also found that lamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but may cause adverse events such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\n**Limitations**\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\n### Is the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "While the summary passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness, it needs significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The vocabulary is too technical, and long sentences and paragraphs make key findings difficult to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex and technical language.** The summary uses many words that are not common in everyday language. This makes the text difficult to read and understand.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments...\" and \"...assess the potential adverse events...\"\n   - **Reason:** 'Efficacy', 'tolerability', and 'adverse events' are technical terms. Plain language alternatives are needed.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...find out how well drug treatments work and what unwanted effects (side effects) they might have.\"\n\n2. **Break up long, dense paragraphs.** The 'Results' section is a single, 125-word paragraph that presents information about the studies, the participants, and the findings for two different medicines. This 'wall of text' is overwhelming for readers.\n   - **Problematic section:** The entire paragraph under 'What did we find?'.\n   - **Reason:** It mixes too many different ideas, making it hard for a reader to separate the study background from the actual results for each drug.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Break this into three shorter paragraphs. The first should describe the studies and participants. The second and third should clearly state the findings for mexiletine and lamotrigine, respectively. For example:\n   \"We found 17 trials with 392 people... \n\n   For people with non-dystrophic myotonia, we found that:\n   - Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n   - Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\"\n\n3. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes the writing less direct and harder to follow.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...the primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia...\"\n   - **Reason:** This phrasing is passive and unnecessarily complex.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...we mainly wanted to know how much participants said their muscle stiffness improved.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns, with good use of active voice and pronouns. However, there is a significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, long words, and nominalizations, are in the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range. This indicates that the text's vocabulary is far more complex and its sentence structure more noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the editorial judgment that the draft is too technical for a lay audience."
