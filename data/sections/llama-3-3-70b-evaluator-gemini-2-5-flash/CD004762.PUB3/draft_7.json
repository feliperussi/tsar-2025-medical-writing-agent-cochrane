We did not find good evidence that any medicine helped with stiffness for people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, feeling tired, and headache. However, because the evidence is not strong, we are uncertain about the true benefits and harms of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause serious disability and affect people's health in those with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects the whole body and can also cause muscles to get weaker over time and other problems like irregular heartbeats and clouding of the lens of the eye. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work to reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. We also looked for any unwanted side effects. We focused on the best available evidence from studies called randomized controlled trials.\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing medicines for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy:\n- We found no good evidence that any medicine improved the main symptoms of muscle stiffness.\n- Mexiletine probably helps muscles relax faster after gripping, but we are uncertain if it improves quality of life.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and probably improves quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, I'm recommending a few revisions to enhance clarity for patients before final approval. My top 3 suggestions focus on better explaining the conditions discussed, simplifying a list of technical drug classes, and more clearly defining medical terms for side effects. These changes will make the summary more accessible and directly address the high number of long words identified in the linguistic analysis.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with excellent scores for sentence length, active voice, and overall readability (78% of metrics are in the best quartile). However, the analysis flagged one area for review: the count of long words (7+ characters) is higher than typical, falling into the 90th percentile. This suggests that while the sentence structure is clear, some of the vocabulary could be simplified."
