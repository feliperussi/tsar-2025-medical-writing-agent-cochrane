  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that some medicines, such as mexiletine (a type of sodium channel blocker that helps relax muscles) and lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness), may reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (problems with the stomach and intestines), lethargy (feeling tired), and headache. But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic condition that can also cause progressive muscle weakness and other systemic problems like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to find out how well drug treatments work and what unwanted effects they might have for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing drug treatments for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people. \nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, we found that:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is a critical factual omission in the Results section that could mislead readers. The summary only reports findings for non-dystrophic myotonia, completely leaving out the different and less positive results for myotonic dystrophy. This must be corrected to ensure accuracy. Additionally, several key sentences are too long and complex for a lay audience, and the text relies on technical terms where simpler language would be clearer.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Add the Missing Results for Myotonic Dystrophy:**\nThe current results section is factually incomplete and therefore misleading. It only presents findings for non-dystrophic myotonia, which could give false hope to people with myotonic dystrophy, for whom the treatments were not shown to be as effective.\n- **Problematic Section:** The entire 'Results' section is missing this information. It starts with \"For people with non-dystrophic myotonia...\" and never mentions the other patient group.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Please restructure the 'Results' section to clearly separate the findings for both groups. For example:\n\n> **What did we find?**\n> We found 17 trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n>\n> **For people with myotonic dystrophy:**\n> - We found no good evidence that any drug improved the main symptoms of muscle stiffness.\n> - Mexiletine likely helps muscles relax faster after gripping, but we are uncertain if it improves quality of life.\n>\n> **For people with non-dystrophic myotonia:**\n> - Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n> - Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\n**2. Simplify the First Key Message:**\nThe first key message is over 40 words long and contains multiple clauses and definitions, making it difficult to process in one reading.\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"We found that some medicines, such as mexiletine (a type of sodium channel blocker that helps relax muscles) and lamotrigine (a medication that can help reduce muscle stiffness), may reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in the results.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this into shorter, more direct sentences:\n> \"Medicines like mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce muscle stiffness for some people with myotonic disorders. However, this finding is based on evidence that is not strong, so we are not very confident in the results.\"\n\n**3. Replace Technical Terms with Simpler Language:**\nThe draft uses several long, technical words when simpler, everyday terms would be easier for readers to understand. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of long words.\n- **Problematic Phrases:** \"gastrointestinal symptoms\", \"systemic condition\", \"progressive muscle weakness\"\n- **Suggested Rewrites:**\n> - Instead of \"gastrointestinal symptoms\", write \"stomach and gut problems\".\n> - Instead of \"systemic condition\", write \"a condition that affects the whole body\".\n> - Instead of \"progressive muscle weakness\", write \"muscles getting weaker over time\".",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified one notable deviation: the count of 'long_words' (175) is in the 90th percentile, significantly higher than the typical median of 122. This metric supports the editorial feedback to replace complex and long vocabulary with simpler alternatives to improve clarity for a lay audience."
