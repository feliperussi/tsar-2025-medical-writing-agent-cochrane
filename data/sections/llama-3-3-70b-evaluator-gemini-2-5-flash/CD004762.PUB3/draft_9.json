  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey Messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia, the medicine mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness.\n- Another medicine, lamotrigine, may also help muscles relax faster.\n- People taking these medicines may have unwanted effects, like stomach problems or headaches, but we need more evidence to be certain about the risks.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause serious disability and affect people's health in those with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work to reduce muscle stiffness in people with myotonic disorders. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing medicines for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy:\n- We found no good evidence that any medicine improved the main symptoms of muscle stiffness.\n- Mexiletine probably helps muscles relax faster after gripping, but we are uncertain if it improves quality of life.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and probably improves quality of life.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported on the results we were most interested in, like muscle stiffness or quality of life.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
