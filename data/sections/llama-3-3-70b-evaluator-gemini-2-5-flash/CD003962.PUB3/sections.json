  "key_messages": [
    "Benefits and risks of blood-pressure medications for people with IgA Nephropathy (a kidney disease where the kidneys get damaged by an antibody called immunoglobulin A), such as antihypertensive (blood pressure-lowering) therapies, are still being researched, but these medications may decrease proteinuria (excess protein in the urine, a sign of kidney damage) without causing significant harm.",
    "Tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils) may increase remission of proteinuria and haematuria (blood in the urine) in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.",
    "Future research should focus on long-term benefits and potential harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensive agents and tonsillectomy, and explore their effects in diverse populations to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is IgA nephropathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "IgA nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. It is the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms such as blood in the urine, proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), and high blood pressure. If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What are the current treatments for IgA nephropathy?",
      "content": "Currently, there are various treatments available for IgAN, including immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensives, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. They examined various non-immunosuppressive, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines, to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN. The authors also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments and their potential impact on important kidney and cardiovascular outcomes."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA nephropathy. The search covered multiple databases, used predefined inclusion criteria, and was limited to studies reporting relevant outcomes."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Data Synthesis",
      "content": "The results of the eligible studies were combined using meta‑analytic methods where appropriate. Effect sizes for benefits and harms were calculated, and heterogeneity across studies was assessed."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Confidence Assessment",
      "content": "We rated our confidence in the body of evidence using the GRADE framework, considering factors such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias to evaluate the overall certainty of the estimated benefits and harms."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "Cause of Termination",
      "content": "The agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations configured for the current task, preventing further processing."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Recommended Action",
      "content": "Review the iteration limit settings, simplify the task, or break it into smaller sub‑tasks to allow the agent to complete its work without exceeding the limit."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity in populations and intervention delivery methods. Consequently, the evidence does not comprehensively cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023."
