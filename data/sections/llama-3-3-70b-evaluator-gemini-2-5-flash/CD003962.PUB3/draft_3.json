  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nIgA Nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response (when the body's defense system doesn't work properly). It affects approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms such as blood in the urine (haematuria), excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), and high blood pressure (hypertension). If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis (a treatment that filters and purifies the blood using a machine) or a kidney transplant (when a healthy kidney from a donor is surgically implanted).\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that blood-pressure medications (antihypertensives) may help decrease proteinuria in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils) may increase remission of proteinuria and haematuria in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future research should focus on long-term benefits and potential harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensive agents and tonsillectomy, and explore their effects in diverse populations to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN, including immunosuppressive therapy (which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response), antihypertensives, anticoagulants (which prevent blood clotting), dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. They examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines, to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA Nephropathy. The search covered multiple databases, used predefined inclusion criteria, and was limited to studies reporting relevant outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThe review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Antihypertensive therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, renin-angiotensin system inhibition (a type of blood pressure-lowering treatment) probably decreases proteinuria. Tonsillectomy may increase remission of proteinuria and haematuria in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity (differences) in populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and complete, but it is not ready for publication. The language is too complex and academic for a general audience, making it difficult to read and understand. The key issues are overly long sentences, use of technical jargon, and an inconsistent, formal tone. To improve the summary, please focus on the following 3 areas:\n\n1.  **Break up long, complex sentences.** Many sentences are over 30 words long and contain multiple complex ideas. This makes them hard for readers to follow. Aim for an average sentence length of 15-20 words.\n    *   **Example:** \"If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis (a treatment that filters and purifies the blood using a machine) or a kidney transplant (when a healthy kidney from a donor is surgically implanted).\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"If not treated, IgAN can lead to serious problems like kidney failure. People with kidney failure may need dialysis, which uses a machine to clean the blood. Another option is a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney from a donor is placed in the body.\"\n\n2.  **Replace technical terms with everyday language.** The summary uses research jargon that patients are unlikely to understand.\n    *   **Example:** \"The search covered multiple databases, used predefined inclusion criteria, and was limited to studies reporting relevant outcomes.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched several medical databases for studies that met our requirements.\"\n\n3.  **Use 'we' consistently and write in a more direct style.** The text switches between the formal \"the review authors\" and the preferred \"we\". Using \"we\" consistently makes the summary more personal and easier to read, as recommended by the style guide.\n    *   **Example:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment...\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that the draft deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Overall readability is very low, with the Flesch Reading Ease score falling in the bottom 10% of our corpus. Furthermore, 14 other metrics measuring sentence length, vocabulary complexity, and readability grade level are in the P90 range or beyond, indicating the text is substantially more complex and difficult to read than a typical PLS. For example, the average sentence length is 25.5 words and the Flesch-Kincaid grade level is 16.4, both well above the recommended targets for a lay audience."
