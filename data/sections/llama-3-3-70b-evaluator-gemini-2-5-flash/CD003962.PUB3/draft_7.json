  "draft": "IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure. This summary looks at treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system, such as blood-pressure medicines and tonsil removal, to see how well they work and what their risks are.\n\nWhat is IgA Nephropathy and why is it a problem?\nIgA Nephropathy is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. It is the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms such as blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), and high blood pressure. If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN. These include immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. However, using medicines that suppress the immune system for a long time can have significant risks. Other treatments work without suppressing the immune system. They help avoid the risks that come with long-term immunosuppressive therapy. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, blood-pressure medications (antihypertensives), dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils), and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA Nephropathy. We searched several medical databases for studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThis review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment, certain blood-pressure medicines probably decrease the amount of excess protein in the urine. Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity in populations and intervention delivery methods. Consequently, the evidence does not comprehensively cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.",

There are two critical issues: the main title is missing, and the 'Key messages' subheading is not phrased as a question as required. Additionally, the language is often too technical and dense, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The methods section is vague, and the key messages could be stronger and better aligned with the source material. Addressing these points will significantly improve the summary's readability and impact.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with many features falling in the best quartile or median range. However, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex, long, and noun-heavy words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This statistical finding supports the editorial recommendation to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
