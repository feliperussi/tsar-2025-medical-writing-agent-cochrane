  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nIgA Nephropathy, or IgAN, is a type of kidney disease. It happens when the kidneys get inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. This disease affects 20% to 40% of patients who may have kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine, and high blood pressure.\n\nIf not treated, IgAN can lead to serious problems like kidney failure. People with kidney failure may need dialysis, which uses a machine to clean the blood. Another option is a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney from a donor is placed in the body.\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy, or surgical removal of the tonsils, may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN. But the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.\n\nWhat is IgA Nephropathy and why is it a problem?\nIgA Nephropathy is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed. It is the most common disease that directly affects the tiny filters in the kidneys. IgAN affects approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine, and high blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN. These include immunosuppressive therapy, which uses medicines to calm the body's overactive defense system. However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, like blood-pressure medications, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, help control blood pressure, reduce excess protein in the urine, and minimize the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, blood-pressure medications, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA Nephropathy. We searched several medical databases for studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThis review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment, a type of blood-pressure-lowering treatment probably decreases excess protein in the urine. Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small, many were likely unblinded, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there were major differences in the people included and how they received the treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Reduce Repetition in the Introduction:** The initial introductory paragraph and the first section under the subheading 'What is IgA Nephropathy and why is it a problem?' contain nearly identical information. This forces the reader to process the same facts twice.\n   - **Problem:** The text repeats the definition of IgAN, the percentage of patients affected, and the main symptoms.\n   - **Suggestion:** Keep the detailed explanation under the subheading and make the initial introduction much shorter. For example, the first paragraph could be condensed to: \"IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure. This summary looks at treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system, such as blood-pressure medicines and tonsil removal, to see how well they work and what their risks are.\"\n\n2. **Simplify Noun-Heavy and Technical Phrases:** The draft uses some technical terms and complex noun phrases that can be simplified to be more direct and easier to understand. This is the most important area for improvement.\n   - **Problem Phrase 1:** \"...long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Immunosuppressive management' is a noun-heavy, technical phrase. Using a verb would be more direct.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...using medicines that suppress the immune system for a long time can have significant risks.\"\n   - **Problem Phrase 2:** \"Non-immunosuppressive treatments... minimize the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long (36 words) and the phrasing is complex.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Other treatments work without suppressing the immune system. They help avoid the risks that come with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n\n3. **Clarify Vague Descriptions:** Some descriptions are too general and could be made more concrete for the reader.\n   - **Problem:** \"Compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment, a type of blood-pressure-lowering treatment probably decreases excess protein in the urine.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'a type of blood-pressure-lowering treatment' is vague. While we want to avoid jargon, we can be slightly more specific.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Compared to a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment, certain blood-pressure medicines probably decrease the amount of excess protein in the urine.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly conformant with typical PLS patterns, with over 77% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in three key areas related to vocabulary complexity. The counts for nouns (181), Dale-Chall complex words (238), and long words (191) are all in the P90 range, meaning they are much higher than is typical for a PLS. This statistical finding supports the editorial feedback to simplify noun-heavy phrases and replace complex words with more common alternatives to improve clarity for patients."
