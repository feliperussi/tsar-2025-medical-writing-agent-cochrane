  "draft": "What is IgA Nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response (when the body's defense system doesn't work properly). It is the most common primary glomerular disease. About 20% to 40% of people with this condition develop kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms such as blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), and high blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the Current Treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN. These include immunosuppressive therapy (to reduce the immune system's abnormal response), antihypertensives (blood pressure-lowering medicines), anticoagulants (blood thinners), dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhy did we do this Review?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils), and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nOur research team searched medical databases for studies that tested non-immunosuppressive treatments for people with IgA nephropathy. We looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial to find the best quality evidence. This review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. We found that certain blood-pressure medicines probably reduce the amount of protein leaking into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Reducing protein in the urine is an important way to protect the kidneys from further damage. Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n\nHow Reliable is the Evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable variation in the people included and the treatments given. This means the evidence doesn't cover all the types of people, treatments, or results that are important. The review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.\n\nKey Messages:\n- Blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.",

I've outlined the most important changes below.\n\n**Critical Issues**\n\n*   **Missing Title:** The summary is missing a main title. A title is essential to tell readers what the review is about at a glance.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a title phrased as a question, such as: \"What treatments, other than immune-suppressing drugs, can help people with IgA nephropathy?\" \n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Simplify the opening definition.** The first sentence is long and combines several ideas, which can be hard for readers to follow.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"IgA nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response (when the body's defense system doesn't work properly).\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 31-word sentence introduces the disease, its cause, and a definition all at once. Breaking it up will make it easier to digest.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease. It happens when the body's defense system doesn't work properly and causes the kidneys to become inflamed.\"\n\n2.  **Replace complex phrases with simpler, everyday language.** Some phrases use technical or formal language where simpler words would be clearer.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"improving blood pressure management\" and \"minimizing the risks associated with\" are wordy and less direct.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The goals of these treatments are to control blood pressure, reduce protein in the urine, and avoid the risks of long-term immune-suppressing drugs.\"\n\n3.  **Make the key findings easier to spot.** The \"What did we Find?\" section mixes methods (how you searched) with the results, which buries the main takeaways in a dense paragraph.\n    *   **Original paragraph:** \"Our research team searched medical databases for studies that tested non-immunosuppressive treatments for people with IgA nephropathy.

Our main findings were:\\n    - Blood-pressure medicines probably reduce the amount of protein leaking into the urine.

However, this evidence is mainly from studies of Japanese people, so we are not sure if it applies to everyone.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis**\n\nYour own editorial judgment about complex language is supported by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a high number of 'long words' (173 instances), placing it in the 90th percentile compared to other summaries. This contributes to a high Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 13.3, making the text more difficult than necessary. The suggestions above will help simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 66.7% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis identified a significant deviation in the number of long words (words with 7+ characters), which is in the 90th percentile. This contributes to high readability grade levels (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 13.27) and suggests that simplifying vocabulary should be a priority."
