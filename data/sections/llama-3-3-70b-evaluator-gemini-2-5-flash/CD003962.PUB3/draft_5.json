  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nIgA Nephropathy, or IgAN, is a type of kidney disease. It happens when the kidneys get inflamed due to an abnormal immune response (when the body's defense system doesn't work properly). This disease affects 20% to 40% of patients who may have kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), and high blood pressure.\n\nIf not treated, IgAN can lead to serious problems like kidney failure. People with kidney failure may need dialysis, which uses a machine to clean the blood. Another option is a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney from a donor is placed in the body.\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy, or surgical removal of the tonsils, may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN. But the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.\n\nWhat is IgA Nephropathy and why is it a problem?\nIgA Nephropathy is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed. It is the most common disease that directly affects the tiny filters in the kidneys. IgAN affects approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine, and high blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN. These include immunosuppressive therapy (treatment that reduces the immune system's abnormal response), which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, like blood-pressure medications, anticoagulants (medications that prevent blood clotting), dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing excess protein in the urine, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, blood-pressure medications, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA Nephropathy. We searched several medical databases for studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThis review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment, a type of blood-pressure-lowering treatment probably decreases excess protein in the urine. Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity (differences) in populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and structure. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is the use of dense, technical vocabulary and noun-heavy phrases, which makes the text harder to read than necessary. Focusing on simplifying word choices and using more direct verbs will significantly improve this summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Vocabulary and Technical Terms:** The summary uses many long, technical words. While some are defined, replacing them with simpler, everyday language would make the text more accessible.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"...there was considerable heterogeneity (differences) in populations and intervention delivery methods.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Even with a definition, the sentence is academic and clunky. The goal is to use the simple word from the start.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were small and had major differences in the people they included and how they gave the treatments.\"\n\n**2. Use Active Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Reduce Nominalization):** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., \"management\" instead of \"manage\"), which makes sentences less direct and more passive-sounding.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"Non-immunosuppressive treatments... have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Using \"management\" twice makes the sentence dense. Using the verb \"manage\" or \"control\" is more direct and easier to understand.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Non-immunosuppressive treatments have become a key way to manage IgAN. These treatments help control blood pressure...\"\n\n**3. Remove Redundancy and Improve Conciseness:** Some sentences repeat information or use more words than needed, which can slow the reader down.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"These include immunosuppressive therapy (treatment that reduces the immune system's abnormal response), which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The explanation is stated once in the parentheses and then immediately repeated. This is unnecessary.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"One option is immunosuppressive therapy, which uses medicines to calm the body's overactive defense system.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. The summary performs well on structural metrics, with good sentence length (words_per_sentence in P25) and appropriate use of active voice (active_voice in P75). However, there is significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including long_words (BEYOND_P90), complex_words (P90), nominalization (P90), and the SMOG index (P90), are much higher than is typical for a PLS, indicating the language is too technical and dense for a lay audience."
