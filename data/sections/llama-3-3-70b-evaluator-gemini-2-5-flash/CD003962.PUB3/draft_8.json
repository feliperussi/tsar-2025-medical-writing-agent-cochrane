  "draft": "Benefits and Risks of Blood‑Pressure Medications and Tonsillectomy for People with IgA Nephropathy\n\nWhat is IgA Nephropathy and why is it a problem?\nIgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease where the kidneys get damaged by an antibody called immunoglobulin A (a type of protein). It's the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), and high blood pressure. If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN, including immunosuppressive therapy (which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response). However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensives (blood pressure-lowering medications), anticoagulants (blood thinners), dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils), and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA nephropathy. We searched multiple databases, used predefined inclusion criteria, and were limited to studies reporting relevant outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThis review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment, certain blood-pressure medicines probably decrease the amount of excess protein in the urine. Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity in populations and intervention delivery methods. Consequently, the evidence does not comprehensively cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages from this review?\n- What are the benefits and risks of blood-pressure medications for people with IgA Nephropathy? \nWe found that blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- What are the benefits and risks of tonsillectomy for people with IgA Nephropathy? \nTonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- What future research is needed to better understand the benefits and risks of non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA Nephropathy? \nFuture studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs significant revisions to meet the Cochrane Plain Language Summary guidelines. It fails a critical check because the main title is not phrased as a question. More importantly, the text uses a high number of complex, technical words and long sentences that will be difficult for a lay audience to understand. This is confirmed by the linguistic analysis, which shows that several key readability and vocabulary metrics are well outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary. To improve the draft, please focus on simplifying the language and sentence structure throughout the document.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n\n*   **Title Format:** The main title must be a question to engage the reader. \n    *   **Current Title:** `Benefits and Risks of Blood‑Pressure Medications and Tonsillectomy for People with IgA Nephropathy`\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** `What are the benefits and risks of blood-pressure medications and tonsillectomy for people with IgA nephropathy?`\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Replace technical terms and jargon with everyday language.** The summary contains many words that are common in research but confusing for patients. This makes key sections hard to follow.\n    *   **Example:** \"Non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensives (blood pressure-lowering medications), anticoagulants (blood thinners), dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 32-word sentence is packed with technical terms. Phrases like \"mainstay in the management\" are jargon.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To avoid the risks of these powerful drugs, doctors often use other treatments first. These include medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, special diets, and herbal medicines. These have become the main way to manage IgAN.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the explanation of the methods.** The current description of the search process is vague and uses research-specific language that doesn't help the reader understand what you did.\n    *   **Example:** \"We performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA nephropathy. We searched multiple databases, used predefined inclusion criteria, and were limited to studies reporting relevant outcomes.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"systematic search of the literature\" and \"predefined inclusion criteria\" are meaningless to most readers.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our research team searched medical databases for studies that tested non-immunosuppressive treatments for people with IgA nephropathy. We looked for a specific type of study called a randomised controlled trial to find the best quality evidence.\"\n\n3.  **Break down long, complex sentences in the limitations section.** This section is crucial for helping readers understand the certainty of the evidence, but the current wording is too dense.\n    *   **Example:** \"...there was considerable heterogeneity in populations and intervention delivery methods. Consequently, the evidence does not comprehensively cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Words like \"heterogeneity,\" \"intervention delivery methods,\" and \"consequently\" make the sentence very difficult to read.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...the people included in the studies were very different from each other, and the treatments were given in different ways. This means the evidence doesn't cover all the types of people, treatments, or results that are important.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like active voice and pronoun use are good (P75), there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, including `smog_index`, `long_words`, `complex_words`, and `complex_words_dc`. This indicates the text uses far more long, complex, and uncommon words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, making it difficult for a general audience to read and understand."
