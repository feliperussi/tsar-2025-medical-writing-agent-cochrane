  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of blood-pressure medications and tonsillectomy for people with IgA nephropathy?\n\nIgA nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. It is the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms such as blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), and high blood pressure. If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN, including immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as medicines to lower blood pressure (antihypertensives), blood thinners (anticoagulants), special diets, and herbal medicines, have become a main way to manage IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils), and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nOur research team searched medical databases for studies that tested non-immunosuppressive treatments for people with IgA nephropathy. We looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial to find the best quality evidence.\n\nThis review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to a dummy pill or no treatment, certain blood-pressure medicines probably decrease the amount of excess protein in the urine. Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable variation in the people included and the treatments given. This means the evidence doesn't cover all the types of people, treatments, or results that are important.\n\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.\n\nThe key messages from this review are:\n- Blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some structural and clarity improvements to make it easier for patients to read and understand. The main issue is that the text is missing the required question-based subheadings, which makes it difficult to navigate. Additionally, several sentences are too long and complex, which can make the key findings hard to follow. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Add question-based subheadings to structure the text.**\nThe summary is currently a single block of text, which can be intimidating for readers. The style guide requires subheadings to break up the content and guide the reader. \n- **Suggestion:** Add subheadings like those used in the source material, for example: 'What is IgA nephropathy?', 'Why did we do this review?', 'What did we find?', and 'How reliable is the evidence?'.\n\n2. **Shorten long sentences to improve readability.**\nSeveral sentences combine multiple ideas, making them difficult to process. Breaking them into shorter, single-idea sentences will make the information much clearer.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"It is the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"It is the most common type of kidney disease caused by problems with the kidneys' filters. About 20% to 40% of people with this condition develop kidney failure within 25 years.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the main findings for a lay audience.**\nThe results are summarized correctly but could be explained more clearly to help readers understand their importance.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Compared to a dummy pill or no treatment, certain blood-pressure medicines probably decrease the amount of excess protein in the urine.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found that certain blood-pressure medicines probably reduce the amount of protein leaking into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Reducing protein in the urine is an important way to protect the kidneys from further damage.\"\n\nThese changes, especially adding subheadings and shortening sentences, will significantly improve the summary's clarity and align it with Cochrane's plain language standards. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that the average sentence length is much higher than is typical for these summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with about half the metrics falling outside the median range. The analysis highlights significant deviations in readability and sentence structure. Key issues identified by the metrics include very high sentence length (25.1 words, in the 90th percentile), which contributes to low reading ease scores (Flesch Reading Ease of 32.4, in the 10th percentile) and high grade-level scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 15.0, in the 90th percentile). Vocabulary is also more complex than typical, with a high number of long words and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. These metrics confirm that the text would benefit from shorter sentences and simpler word choices to be more accessible to a lay audience."
