  "draft": "Benefits and Risks of Blood-Pressure Medications and Tonsillectomy for People with IgA Nephropathy\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that blood-pressure medications may help decrease proteinuria (excess protein in the urine, a sign of kidney damage) in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils) may increase remission of proteinuria and haematuria (blood in the urine) in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment.\n- Future research should focus on long-term benefits and potential harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensive agents and tonsillectomy, and explore their effects in diverse populations.\n\nWhat is IgA Nephropathy and Why is it a Problem?\nIgA Nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. It affects approximately 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms such as blood in the urine, proteinuria, and high blood pressure. If left untreated, IgAN can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat are the Current Treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN, including immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as antihypertensives, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat Did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. They examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines, to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN.\n\nHow Did the Review Authors Search for Evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA nephropathy. The search covered multiple databases, used predefined inclusion criteria, and was limited to studies reporting relevant outcomes.\n\nWhat Did the Review Authors Find?\nThe review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Antihypertensive therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to placebo or no treatment, renin-angiotensin system inhibition probably decreases proteinuria. Tonsillectomy may increase remission of proteinuria and haematuria in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity in populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

More importantly, the summary omits the critical context that the evidence for tonsillectomy comes exclusively from studies in Japanese people, which misleads the reader about the treatment's general applicability. The text also uses unexplained technical jargon (e.g., 'renin-angiotensin system inhibition') and has poor overall readability, as confirmed by multiple linguistic metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in some structural areas like sentence length and use of active voice. However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in readability and vocabulary. The Flesch Reading Ease score (28.56) is in the lowest 10th percentile, indicating the text is very difficult to read. This is supported by metrics in the 90th percentile for complexity, including the SMOG index (14.45), number of complex words (120), number of long words (188), all of which should be reduced to improve clarity for a lay audience."
