  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nIgA Nephropathy, or IgAN, is a type of kidney disease. It happens when the kidneys get inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. This disease affects 20% to 40% of patients who may have kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine, and high blood pressure. \n\nIf not treated, IgAN can lead to serious problems like kidney failure. People with kidney failure may need dialysis, which uses a machine to clean the blood. Another option is a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney from a donor is placed in the body.\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that blood-pressure medications may help decrease excess protein in the urine in people with IgA Nephropathy without causing significant harm.\n- Tonsillectomy, or surgical removal of the tonsils, may increase remission of excess protein and blood in the urine in people with IgAN. But the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment, especially since the studies were mainly conducted in Japanese people with IgAN.\n- Future research should focus on long-term benefits and potential harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments, like blood-pressure medications and tonsillectomy. It should explore their effects in diverse populations to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n\nWhat is IgA Nephropathy and why is it a problem?\nIgA Nephropathy is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed. It is the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting 20% to 40% of patients who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. IgAN can cause symptoms like blood in the urine, excess protein in the urine, and high blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\nCurrently, there are various treatments available for IgAN. These include immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. However, long-term immunosuppressive management can have significant risks. Non-immunosuppressive treatments, like blood-pressure medications, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, have become a mainstay in the management of IgAN. These treatments focus on improving blood pressure management, reducing excess protein in the urine, and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgAN in adults and children. We examined various non-immunosuppressive treatments, including anticoagulants, blood-pressure medications, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines. We aimed to determine their effectiveness in managing IgAN and evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these treatments.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of the literature for studies evaluating non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA Nephropathy. We searched several medical databases for studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThis review includes 80 studies with 4856 participants. Blood-pressure therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy, with 37 studies and 1799 participants. Compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment, a type of blood-pressure-lowering treatment probably decreases excess protein in the urine. Tonsillectomy may increase remission of excess protein and blood in the urine in people with IgAN, but the evidence is not strong enough to widely recommend this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were likely unblinded, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and there was considerable heterogeneity in populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

Focusing on simplifying vocabulary will significantly improve readability. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace technical jargon with simpler explanations.** The summary should be understandable to someone with no medical background.\n    - **Problematic Phrase:** '...the most common primary glomerular disease...'\n    - **Why it's a problem:** 'Primary glomerular disease' is medical jargon that will not be understood by most readers.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** '...the most common disease that directly affects the tiny filters in the kidneys.'\n\n2. **Simplify clinical terms and complex phrases.** Even common clinical terms can be made clearer.\n    - **Problematic Phrase:** 'Tonsillectomy may increase remission of excess protein and blood in the urine...'\n    - **Why it's a problem:** 'Remission' is a clinical term. Using a more descriptive phrase is better for a lay audience.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Tonsillectomy may help the levels of protein and blood in the urine return to normal...'\n\n3. **Make the language more direct and less academic.** Some sentences are structured in a way that is common in scientific writing but can be simplified for patients.\n    - **Problematic Sentence:** 'It should explore their effects in diverse populations to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.'\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This is abstract and wordy. Phrases like 'diverse populations' and 'reliable evidence for decision-making' can be simplified.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Future studies should include people from different backgrounds so we can be more certain about who these treatments help the most.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your own editorial judgment is confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The summary has a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns (all metrics in the P90 range), which makes it more difficult to read than a typical Plain Language Summary. The suggestions above will help address these underlying metric issues.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile. The draft has excellent sentence structure, with low sentence length and passive voice. However, the analysis highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—`nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, and `long_words`—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex, long, and technical words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests that simplifying vocabulary should be the primary focus for improvement."
