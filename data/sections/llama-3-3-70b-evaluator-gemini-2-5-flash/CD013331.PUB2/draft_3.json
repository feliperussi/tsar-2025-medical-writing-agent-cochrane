  "draft": "Is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) effective for reducing period pain in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared to a dummy treatment (placebo) or no treatment. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to other treatments like acupressure (a technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on the body) or pain-relieving medicines. More research is needed to answer these questions.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of TENS on period pain with better design to ensure reliable results. They should also look at other important outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information on the duration of the studies. The population characteristics included women aged 12 to 49 years. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. No information was available on the study funding sources or the settings in which the studies took place. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and other treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. To make it even clearer and more accessible for a lay audience, here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Simplify technical and complex vocabulary.** Some terms, while common in research, can be a barrier for patients. Replacing them with everyday words will significantly improve readability.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The terms 'pharmacological' and 'non-pharmacological' are technical jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This condition is usually treated with medicines, but some women may prefer alternatives that do not use drugs.\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences feel abstract and dense. Converting these back to verbs makes the text more direct and easier to understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high‐frequency TENS and other treatments.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** \"The occurrence of adverse effects\" is an indirect and wordy noun phrase.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"High-frequency TENS and other treatments may have similar side effects.\"\n\n3. **Improve conciseness by removing redundancy.** Some sections repeat information, making them longer than necessary. Combining and simplifying these sentences helps readers grasp the key points faster.\n   - **Problematic section:** \"The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** These two sentences state the same goal in slightly different ways.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how effective and safe TENS is for period pain compared to a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or other therapies.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much easier for patients and the public to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mixed profile. While the draft has excellent sentence length and scores well on several readability indices (placing it in the best 25% of the corpus for 11 metrics), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including 'complex_words', 'long_words', 'nominalization', and the 'smog_index', are in the highest 10th percentile (P90). This indicates that the text uses more technical, multi-syllable, and noun-heavy language than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
