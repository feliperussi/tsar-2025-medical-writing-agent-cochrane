  "draft": "Is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) effective for reducing period pain in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared to a dummy treatment (placebo) or no treatment, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to other treatments like acupressure (a technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on the body) or pain-relieving medicines. More research is needed to answer these questions.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of TENS on period pain with better design to ensure reliable results. They should also look at other important outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It causes painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. This condition is usually treated with medicines, but some women may prefer alternatives that do not use drugs. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe TENS is for period pain compared to a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or other therapies.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were conducted in various countries and included women aged 12 to 49 years. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. High-frequency TENS and other treatments may have similar side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",
