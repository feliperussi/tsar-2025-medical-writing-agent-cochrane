  "draft": "Can transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in this finding.\n- The review did not find any reports of harmful effects from TENS. But this does not necessarily mean that TENS is completely safe, as the number of studies and women included in the review was limited.\n- Future research should focus on designing high-quality studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness and safety of TENS for menstrual cramps.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It causes painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies were very small. This reduces reliability and precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start but is not approved because it omits a key finding from the review, which could give readers an incomplete picture. Here are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL - Add Missing Findings on Uncertainty.** The results section only states that TENS may be better than a placebo. It completely omits the important finding that the review was uncertain whether one type of TENS is better than another, or if TENS is better than other common treatments. This is crucial for a balanced summary.\n    *   **Current Text:** (This finding is missing entirely from the 'What did we find?' section.)\n    *   **Suggested Addition:** Please add a sentence to the end of the results section, such as: 'However, we are uncertain if high-frequency TENS works better than low-frequency TENS. We are also uncertain if TENS is more effective than other treatments like acupressure or painkillers (acetaminophen).'\n\n2. **Simplify Noun-Heavy and Technical Phrases.** Some sentences use formal language that can be simplified for a lay audience. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns), which can make text less direct.\n    *   **Original:** 'The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments.'\n    *   **Problem:** The repeated phrase 'pharmacological treatments' is technical and wordy.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'This condition is usually treated with medicines, but some women may prefer options that do not involve drugs.'\n\n3. **Improve the Flow of the Results Section.** The main findings are presented in two separate, repetitive sentences, which makes them a bit choppy to read.\n    *   **Original:** 'High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is repetitive and can be stated more efficiently in a single sentence.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We found that both high-frequency and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain more than a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows strong conformity with typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and simplicity. However, the 'nominalization' metric is high (P90), suggesting that some sentences could be made more direct by converting noun phrases into verbs, which aligns with the feedback provided."
