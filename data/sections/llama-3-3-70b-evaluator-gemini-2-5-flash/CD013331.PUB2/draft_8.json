  "draft": "Can transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in this finding.\n- The review did not find any reports of harmful effects from TENS. But this does not necessarily mean that TENS is completely safe, as the review included a limited number of studies and women.\n- Future research should use high-quality methods and also look at how TENS affects women's daily activities and quality of life.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It causes painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. This condition is usually treated with medicines, but some women may prefer options that do not involve drugs. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of TENS with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments. We found that both high-frequency and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain more than a placebo or no treatment. However, we are uncertain if high-frequency TENS works better than low-frequency TENS. We are also uncertain if TENS is more effective than other treatments like acupressure or painkillers (acetaminophen).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies were very small. This reduces reliability and precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

All readability scores, such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.06) and Dale-Chall (6.54), are excellent. Sentence length and structure are also strong, with low average words per sentence (16.56) and minimal passive voice (6 instances). There are no metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns, confirming the draft's high quality and readability."
