  "draft": "# Is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) effective for reducing period pain in women?\n**Key Messages**\n- High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain in women compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.\n- The review found that it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to other treatments like acupressure (a technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on the body) or pain-relieving medicines, and more research is needed to answer these questions.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of TENS on period pain with better design to ensure reliable results, and should also look at other important outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n**Introduction**\n### What is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information on the duration of the studies. The population characteristics included women aged 12 to 49 years. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. No information was available on the study funding sources or the settings in which the studies took place. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and other treatments.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

The linguistic analysis supports these observations, indicating the text is more complex and noun-heavy than typical Plain Language Summaries.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** The 'Methods' subheading is not phrased as a question, which is a requirement of the style guide.\n    *   **Quote:** '### Methods'\n    *   **Problem:** All subheadings should be phrased as questions to guide the reader effectively.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** '### What did we do?' or '### How did we find the evidence?'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Redundant Definitions and Sentence Length in Key Messages:**\n    *   **Quote:** 'High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain in women compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this.'\n    *   **Problem:** The definition of TENS is repeated from the title, making this sentence unnecessarily long and wordy (46 words). This contributes to higher complexity metrics.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared to a dummy treatment (placebo) or no treatment. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.'\n2.  **Wordiness and Repetition in Results:**\n    *   **Quote:** 'The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information on the duration of the studies. The population characteristics included women aged 12 to 49 years. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. No information was available on the study funding sources or the settings in which the studies took place.'\n    *   **Problem:** This paragraph is dense, contains repetitive phrasing ('The studies,' 'no information was available'), and could be more concise.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling within the best quartile. However, six metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range): nominalization (27.0), nouns (181.0), smog_index (14.1), complex_words_dc (236.0), complex_words (126.0), and long_words (191.0). These deviations indicate that the text tends to be more complex, noun-heavy, and uses more multi-syllabic words than is typical for Plain Language Summaries, suggesting a need to simplify vocabulary, reduce nominalizations, and shorten sentences for improved readability."
