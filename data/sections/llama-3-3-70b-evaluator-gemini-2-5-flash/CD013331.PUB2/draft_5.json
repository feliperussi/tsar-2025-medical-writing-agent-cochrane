  "draft": "# Can transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?\n**Key Messages**\n- High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, but the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in this finding.\n- The review did not find any reports of harmful effects from TENS, but this does not necessarily mean that TENS is completely safe, as the number of studies and women included in the review was limited.\n- Future research should focus on designing high-quality studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness and safety of TENS for menstrual cramps, including its effects on daily activities and quality of life.\n**Introduction**\n### What is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information on the duration of the studies. The population characteristics included women aged 12 to 49 years. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. No information was available on the study funding sources. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and other treatments.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias) and the studies were very small, reducing reliability and precision.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

The 'Methods' subheading is not phrased as a question, which violates the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the Key Messages contain a redundant definition, the Results section is a single, dense paragraph, and there is a general pattern of nominalization and wordiness throughout the text, making it less accessible. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows deviations in nominalization, noun count, and several readability indices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 22.2% of features in the best quartile and 50% in the median range. However, five features deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range): nominalization (27 instances, target <13.0), nouns (162 instances, target <116.0), SMOG index (13.8, target <12.1), Dale-Chall complex words (219 instances, target <160.0), and long words (181 instances, target <122.0). These deviations suggest the text could benefit from simpler vocabulary, reduced noun-heavy constructions, and shorter sentences to improve readability for the target audience."
