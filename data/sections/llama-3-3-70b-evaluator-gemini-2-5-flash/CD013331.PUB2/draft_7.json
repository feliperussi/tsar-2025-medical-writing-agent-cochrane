  "draft": "Can transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, so we are not very confident in this finding.\n- The review did not find any reports of harmful effects from TENS. But this does not necessarily mean that TENS is completely safe, as the number of studies and women included in the review was limited.\n- Future research should focus on designing high-quality studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness and safety of TENS for menstrual cramps.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It causes painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. This condition is usually treated with medicines, but some women may prefer options that do not involve drugs. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments. We found that both high-frequency and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain more than a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. However, we are uncertain if high-frequency TENS works better than low-frequency TENS. We are also uncertain if TENS is more effective than other treatments like acupressure or painkillers (acetaminophen).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies were very small. This reduces reliability and precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity and fully align with the source material before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add Specifics to the 'Key Messages' Section:** The third key message is too general. The source material provides important, patient-relevant details about what future research should measure.\n   - **Current text:** \"Future research should focus on designing high-quality studies that can provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness and safety of TENS for menstrual cramps.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This misses key information from the source document about what outcomes matter to patients.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future research should use high-quality methods and also look at how TENS affects women's daily activities and quality of life.\"\n\n2. **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases:** The draft sometimes uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences feel less direct and more formal. Using the verb form is more active and easier to read.\n   - **Current text:** \"We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"in comparison with\" are less direct than a simple verb.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of TENS with placebo...\"\n\n3. **Improve Conciseness:** Some phrases can be shortened to make the summary easier to read, as recommended by the style guide.\n   - **Current text:** \"...as the number of studies and women included in the review was limited.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly wordy and can be made more direct.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...as the review included a limited number of studies and women.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 83% of metrics (15 out of 18) fall within the best quartile for readability and simplicity. However, the analysis identified one deviation: the 'nominalization' score is in the 90th percentile. This metric supports the editorial feedback to replace noun phrases with more direct verbs to improve clarity and flow."
