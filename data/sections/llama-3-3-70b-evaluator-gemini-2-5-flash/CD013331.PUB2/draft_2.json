  "draft": "Is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (a treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) effective for reducing period pain in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared to a dummy treatment (placebo) or no treatment. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to other treatments like acupressure (a technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on the body) or pain-relieving medicines. More research is needed to answer these questions.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of TENS on period pain with better design to ensure reliable results. They should also look at other important outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies, conducted in various countries, included women aged 12 to 49 years. They compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments like acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. We found no specific information on the duration of the studies, their funding sources, or where they took place. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. Adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and other treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

      "feedback": "All critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting have passed. However, the draft can be made significantly clearer for readers by addressing three key areas. First, simplify formal and technical language to use more common, everyday words. Second, revise noun-heavy sentences to use more direct verbs, which will make the text more active and engaging. Third, combine repetitive sentences in the results section to improve the flow and make the findings easier to digest. Addressing these points will improve readability and directly address the high number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations identified in the linguistic analysis.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly conformant with typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure. Five metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-typical complexity: nominalization (noun-form verbs), total nouns, SMOG index, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters). These results suggest that while the overall structure is good, the word choice and sentence construction could be simplified to better serve a lay audience."
