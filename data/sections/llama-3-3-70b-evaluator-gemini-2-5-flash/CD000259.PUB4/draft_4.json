  "draft": "Can giving healthcare professionals information about their performance (audit and feedback) improve the quality of care they provide?\n\nKey messages:\n- Audit and feedback can improve the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals, although the size of the effect varies. No significant harmful effects were reported in the studies, but the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the benefits and potential harms.\n- The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to be greater when it is designed to help healthcare professionals prioritize and take action on important clinical issues, and when it includes characteristics such as individualized feedback, comparison to top performers or benchmarks, and interactive modalities. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand how to optimize the effectiveness of audit and feedback interventions.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more studies in diverse settings and populations. Additionally, research should investigate how to make audit and feedback more effective and sustainable in real-world healthcare settings, and how to balance the potential benefits with the potential costs and unintended consequences.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback, and why is it important for improving healthcare practice?\nAudit and feedback (A&F) is a strategy used to improve professional practice in healthcare. It involves measuring clinical performance over a specified period and providing the resulting data to clinicians or clinical teams. The goal of A&F is to prompt healthcare professionals to modify their practice when it is inconsistent with a desirable target. A&F is widely used, but there is uncertainty about its effects on improving healthcare practice and the characteristics that lead to a greater impact.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about audit and feedback?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of A&F on the practice of healthcare professionals and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of A&F. They wanted to find out how A&F can be used to improve professional practice, what characteristics of A&F lead to a greater impact, and what factors influence its effectiveness.\n\nHow did the review authors search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating audit and feedback interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 292 studies with 678 arms. The studies were conducted in various countries, with 26 studies conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Most studies (237, 81%) targeted physicians as the recipients of audit and feedback. The professional practices most commonly targeted in the studies were prescribing (138 studies, 47%) and test-ordering (103 studies, 35%). Most studies featured multifaceted interventions, with clinician education (377 study arms, 56%) and reminders (100 study arms, 15%) being the most common co-interventions. Audit and feedback probably improves professional practice slightly. For every 100 people, audit and feedback may lead to a small improvement in desired practice. Audit and feedback is most effective when it targets important performance metrics, measures individual practice, involves a local champion, includes multiple interactive modalities, compares performance to top peers or a benchmark, facilitates engagement, and features an actionable plan with specific advice for improvement.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and heterogeneity in study populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2020 of search.",

It contains a critical factual inaccuracy in the results section and needs several improvements to meet plain language standards.\n\nHere are the 4 most important changes needed:\n\n**1. CRITICAL: Correct the misleading description of the main result.**\nThe current phrasing is confusing and factually incorrect because the studies measured professional actions, not outcomes in patients.\n- **Problematic sentence:** 'For every 100 people, audit and feedback may lead to a small improvement in desired practice.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'On average, audit and feedback improved how often healthcare professionals used the recommended practice by 6%. For example, for every 100 times a professional should have done something specific (like ordering the correct test), they did it 6 more times with audit and feedback than without.'\n\n**2. Simplify long, complex sentences.**\nSeveral sentences are too long and use abstract language, making them hard for readers to follow. This is supported by the high number of long and complex words found in the analysis.\n- **Problematic sentence:** 'The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to be greater when it is designed to help healthcare professionals prioritize and take action on important clinical issues, and when it includes characteristics such as individualized feedback, comparison to top performers or benchmarks, and interactive modalities.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Audit and feedback seems to work better when it helps professionals focus on the most important issues. For example, it is more effective when:\n- the feedback is given to each professional individually;\n- it compares their performance to top performers;\n- it is delivered in an interactive way (like a conversation) and not just in writing.'\n\n**3. Explain technical terms.**\nThe summary uses jargon that a lay reader won't understand.\n- **Problematic phrase:** '...292 studies with 678 arms.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found 292 studies. These studies included 678 different groups of healthcare professionals to compare different approaches.'\n\n**4. Use a consistent, personal point of view.**\nThe text switches between 'the review authors' and 'we'. The style guide requires using 'we' to refer to the authors.\n- **Problematic headings:** 'What did the review authors want to find out...', 'How did the review authors search for studies?', 'What did the review authors find?'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'What did we want to find out...', 'How did we search for studies?', 'What did we find?'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has high overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 61% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Seven metrics, including `long_words` (BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (P90), and `nouns` (P90), are much higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This indicates the text relies on long, technical, and abstract words, which can make it difficult for a lay audience to understand."
