  "draft": "Can giving healthcare professionals information about their performance (audit and feedback) improve the quality of care they provide?\n\nKey messages:\n- Audit and feedback can improve the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals, although the size of the effect varies. No significant harmful effects were reported in the studies, but the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the benefits and potential harms.\n- The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to be greater when it is designed to help healthcare professionals prioritize and take action on important clinical issues. For example, it is more effective when:\n- the feedback is given to each professional individually\n- it compares their performance to top performers\n- it is delivered in an interactive way (like a conversation) and not just in writing\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more studies in diverse settings and populations. Additionally, research should investigate how to make audit and feedback more effective and sustainable in real-world healthcare settings, and how to balance the potential benefits with the potential costs and unintended consequences.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback, and why is it important for improving healthcare practice?\nAudit and feedback (A&F) is a strategy used to improve professional practice in healthcare. It involves measuring clinical performance over a specified period and providing the resulting data to clinicians or clinical teams. The goal of A&F is to prompt healthcare professionals to modify their practice when it is inconsistent with a desirable target. A&F is widely used, but there is uncertainty about its effects on improving healthcare practice and the characteristics that lead to a greater impact.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about audit and feedback?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of A&F on the practice of healthcare professionals and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of A&F. We wanted to find out how A&F can be used to improve professional practice, what characteristics of A&F lead to a greater impact, and what factors influence its effectiveness.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating audit and feedback interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 292 studies. These studies included 678 different groups of healthcare professionals to compare different approaches. The studies were conducted in various countries, with 26 studies conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Most studies (237, 81%) targeted physicians as the recipients of audit and feedback. The professional practices most commonly targeted in the studies were prescribing (138 studies, 47%) and test-ordering (103 studies, 35%). Most studies featured multifaceted interventions, with clinician education (377 study arms, 56%) and reminders (100 study arms, 15%) being the most common co-interventions. On average, audit and feedback improved how often healthcare professionals used the recommended practice by 6%. For example, for every 100 times a professional should have done something specific (like ordering the correct test), they did it 6 more times with audit and feedback than without.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and heterogeneity in study populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2020 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. However, it is not yet approved because several sections use technical language and complex sentence structures that will be difficult for a lay audience to understand. The key areas for improvement are simplifying jargon, breaking down long sentences, and making the language more direct and active. Addressing the 3 improvements below will significantly increase the clarity and readability of the summary.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace technical terms with simpler, everyday language.**\nSome sections use jargon that a patient or member of the public is unlikely to understand. Explaining these concepts in plain language is crucial for comprehension.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The evidence is limited by... and **heterogeneity** in study populations and intervention delivery methods.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** 'Heterogeneity' is a statistical term that is meaningless to most readers. It creates a barrier to understanding why the evidence has limitations.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence has some weaknesses. For example, the studies included very different types of people and used different methods, which makes it hard to compare them.\"\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Most studies featured **multifaceted interventions**, with clinician education... and reminders... being the most common **co-interventions**.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** 'Multifaceted interventions' and 'co-interventions' are technical phrases. While the examples help, the sentence can be made much more direct.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Most studies combined audit and feedback with other approaches. The most common additions were extra education for clinicians and reminders.\"\n\n**2. Simplify complex and noun-heavy sentences.**\nSome sentences are long and rely on abstract nouns rather than direct verbs, making them dense and difficult to process.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The goal of A&F is to prompt healthcare professionals to **modify their practice** when it is **inconsistent with a desirable target**.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is very abstract. Using simpler verbs and more direct language would make the goal clearer.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The goal is to help healthcare professionals see where their work differs from best practice, so they can improve.\"\n\n**3. Make the main finding more concrete and easier to grasp.**\nThe explanation of the main result is good, but the initial statement is a bit vague. Adding the concrete example right away makes the finding much more impactful.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"On average, audit and feedback improved how often healthcare professionals used the recommended practice by 6%. For example, for every 100 times a professional should have done something specific (like ordering the correct test), they did it 6 more times with audit and feedback than without.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The first sentence is a bit dry. Leading with the clear, practical example makes the 6% figure much easier to understand.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Audit and feedback improved healthcare professionals' practice. On average, for every 100 times a professional should have done something (like ordering the correct test), they did it 6 more times with audit and feedback than without.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44% of features falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—nouns, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters)—are in the P90 range, indicating the text's vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This data supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and rephrase noun-heavy sentences."
