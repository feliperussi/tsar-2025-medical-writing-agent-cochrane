  "key_messages": [
    "Audit and feedback (a process where healthcare professionals receive information about their performance, or 'audit', and subsequent feedback on how to improve) can improve the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals, although the size of the effect varies. No significant harmful effects were reported in the studies, but the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the benefits and potential harms.",
    "The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to be greater when it is designed to help healthcare professionals prioritize and take action on important clinical issues, and when it includes characteristics such as individualized feedback, comparison to top performers or benchmarks, and interactive modalities. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand how to optimize the effectiveness of audit and feedback interventions.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more studies in diverse settings and populations. Additionally, research should investigate how to make audit and feedback more effective and sustainable in real-world healthcare settings, and how to balance the potential benefits with the potential costs and unintended consequences."

      "content": "Audit and feedback (A&F) is a strategy used to improve professional practice in healthcare. It involves measuring clinical performance over a specified period and providing the resulting data to clinicians or clinical teams. The goal of A&F is to prompt healthcare professionals to modify their practice when it is inconsistent with a desirable target. A&F is widely used, but there is uncertainty about its effects on improving healthcare practice and the characteristics that lead to a greater impact."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of A&F on the practice of healthcare professionals and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of A&F. They wanted to find out how A&F can be used to improve professional practice, what characteristics of A&F lead to a greater impact, and what factors influence its effectiveness."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 292 studies with 678 arms. The studies were conducted in various countries, with 26 studies conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Most studies (237, 81%) targeted physicians as the recipients of audit and feedback. The professional practices most commonly targeted in the studies were prescribing (138 studies, 47%) and test-ordering (103 studies, 35%). Most studies featured multifaceted interventions, with clinician education (377 study arms, 56%) and reminders (100 study arms, 15%) being the most common co-interventions. The studies did not report on the total number of people who took part or the duration of the studies. There was no overview of study funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study settings included various countries, but no specific information was provided on the severity of the condition. Audit and feedback probably improves professional practice slightly. For every 100 people, audit and feedback may lead to a small improvement in desired practice. Audit and feedback is most effective when it targets important performance metrics, measures individual practice, involves a local champion, includes multiple interactive modalities, compares performance to top peers or a benchmark, facilitates engagement, and features an actionable plan with specific advice for improvement."
