  "draft": "Can giving healthcare professionals information about their performance improve the quality of care they provide? \n\nKey messages:\n- Giving healthcare professionals information about their performance, known as audit and feedback, can improve the quality of care they provide, although the size of the effect varies. \n- Audit and feedback seems to be more effective when it is designed to help healthcare professionals prioritize and take action on important clinical issues. \n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more studies in diverse settings and populations.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback, and why is it important for improving healthcare practice? \nAudit and feedback is a strategy used to improve professional practice in healthcare. It involves measuring clinical performance over a specified period and providing the resulting data to clinicians or clinical teams. The goal is to help healthcare professionals see where their work differs from best practice, so they can improve. \n\nWhat did we want to find out about audit and feedback? \nWe aimed to assess the effects of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of audit and feedback. \n\nHow did we search for studies? \nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating audit and feedback interventions. \n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 292 studies. These studies included 678 different groups of healthcare professionals to compare different approaches. We found that audit and feedback improved healthcare professionals' practice. On average, for every 100 times a professional should have done something, like ordering the correct test, they did it 6 more times with audit and feedback than without. \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence has some weaknesses. For example, the studies included very different types of people and used different methods, which makes it hard to compare them. \n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2020. \n\nWe also found that audit and feedback is most effective when it targets important performance metrics, measures individual practice, involves a local champion, includes multiple interactive modalities, compares performance to top peers or a benchmark, facilitates engagement, and features an actionable plan with specific advice for improvement. \n\nFuture research should look at how to make audit and feedback work better in hospitals and clinics for the long term, and how to balance the possible benefits with the costs and risks. The studies most often looked at how doctors prescribe medicines and order tests. \n\nIn summary, audit and feedback can be an effective way to improve the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals, but more research is needed to understand how to make it work best.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent sentence-level clarity. However, it needs revision because key findings are difficult to understand and the overall structure is fragmented. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\\n\\n1. **Make the most important findings easier to scan and understand.** The list of what makes audit and feedback effective is the core takeaway of this review, but it's currently buried in a single, dense sentence.\\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We also found that audit and feedback is most effective when it targets important performance metrics, measures individual practice, involves a local champion, includes multiple interactive modalities, compares performance to top peers or a benchmark, facilitates engagement, and features an actionable plan with specific advice for improvement.\"\\n   - **Reasoning:** This long list is hard for readers to absorb. Using a bulleted list makes these key characteristics much clearer and more memorable.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We also found that audit and feedback seems to work best when it:\\n     - measures an individual's performance, not a team's\\n     - is delivered by a trusted colleague (a 'local champion')\\n     - includes both written and spoken feedback\\n     - compares performance to top performers or a set standard\\n     - includes a clear, actionable plan for improvement\"\\n\\n2. **Improve the overall structure and flow.** The summary feels disconnected because several sections are very short and a key results paragraph is misplaced, appearing after the 'Limitations' and 'Currency' sections.\\n   - **Problematic Structure:** The paragraph beginning \"We also found that...\" is part of the main findings but is separated from the \"What did we find?\" section.\\n   - **Reasoning:** This separation breaks the flow of the results and makes it harder for the reader to connect the main outcome (the 6% improvement) with the details of *why* it improves.\\n   - **Suggested Fix:** Move the paragraph that starts \"We also found that...\" so it directly follows the paragraph ending \"...6 more times with audit and feedback than without.\" This will consolidate all the results in one place.\\n\\n3. **Provide a more balanced view in the Key Messages.** The draft omits important context about the lack of evidence on harms, which is included in the source material.\\n   - **Problematic Text:** The first key message focuses only on the benefits: \"Giving healthcare professionals information about their performance... can improve the quality of care they provide, although the size of the effect varies.\"\\n   - **Reasoning:** For a balanced summary, it's important to mention what is not known, including potential risks. The source material notes that harms were not well-reported.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Giving healthcare professionals information about their performance, known as audit and feedback, can improve the quality of care they provide, although the size of the effect varies. The included studies did not report on harms, so we are uncertain about any potential risks.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and style. Metrics for sentence length (18.4 words), passive voice (8 instances), and reading grade level (10.7) are all excellent. This indicates strong sentence-level writing, but the evaluation also highlights opportunities to improve the overall structure and presentation of key information for better reader comprehension."
