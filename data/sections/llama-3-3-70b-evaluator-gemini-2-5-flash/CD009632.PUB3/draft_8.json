  "draft": "# Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average‑risk women?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected, especially in women with dense breasts (breasts with more tissue and less fat), but it can also result in more false-positive results (when a test incorrectly shows a person has cancer) and unnecessary biopsies (a medical procedure to examine tissue).\n- The current evidence does not tell us if adding ultrasound to mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer, and we need more research, particularly long-term studies, to understand the potential benefits and harms of this combined screening approach.\n- Future studies should investigate how the combination of mammography and ultrasonography affects breast cancer outcomes, such as mortality rates, and explore ways to minimize unnecessary biopsies and false-positive results, to provide clearer guidance for women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography, can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n### What are the current screening methods for breast cancer and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasonography comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasonography to mammography can improve detection rates, but others are concerned about the potential for false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk. They wanted to know whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results. They also investigated the potential harms of this approach, such as increased false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasonography for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk for breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. The women in the studies were between the ages of 40 and 75. None of the studies reported on the funding sources. The studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, with six of the eight studies screening women once, and two studies screening women once, twice, or more. The intervention probably causes a large reduction in outcome. For every 100 people, 10 might stop successfully. The intervention may cause a large reduction in outcome, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on outcome.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and the lack of random assignment to treatment groups, meaning observed differences could be due to participant differences rather than the treatments themselves.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft has critical issues that prevent approval. The 'Results' section contains generic placeholder text that is factually inaccurate and contradictory, failing to report the actual findings of the review. The 'Limitations' section is also generic and misleading, as it contradicts specific details about study types and sizes mentioned in the original abstract. Additionally, several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which violates the style guide. The text also suffers from overly complex vocabulary and noun-heavy sentences, as supported by the linguistic metrics.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Issue:** Factual Inaccuracy in Results Section\n    *   **Quote:** \"The intervention probably causes a large reduction in outcome. For every 100 people, 10 might stop successfully. The intervention may cause a large reduction in outcome, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on outcome.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This is generic placeholder text and does not accurately represent the review's findings. It is also contradictory and provides no meaningful information.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Replace this entire paragraph with the specific findings from the original abstract. For example:\n        \"We found that adding ultrasound to mammography probably detects more breast cancers than mammography alone. For example, one large study found that for every 1000 women, two more breast cancers were detected over two years when ultrasound was added (5 cancers per 1000 women with combined screening versus 3 per 1000 with mammography alone).\n        This combined screening also led to fewer false-negative results (meaning fewer cancers were missed) and fewer interval cancers (cancers found between scheduled screenings). Additionally, women who had combined screening were less likely to have cancer spread to their lymph nodes.\n        However, adding ultrasound also increased the number of false-positive results (when a test incorrectly suggests cancer) and led to more unnecessary biopsies. For every 1000 women without cancer, 37 more received a false-positive result with combined screening. Also, for every 1000 women, 27 more had a biopsy with combined screening compared to mammography alone.\n        For women with dense breasts, adding ultrasound to mammography detected more cancers. One study found three more cancers per 1000 women with dense breasts when ultrasound was added. For women with non-dense breasts, one study suggested more cancers were detected with combined screening, but other studies found no clear difference.\"\n\n2.  **Issue:** Misleading Limitations Section\n    *   **Quote:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes and the lack of random assignment to treatment groups, meaning observed differences could be due to participant differences rather than the treatments themselves.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This statement is too generic and inaccurate. The review included a large randomised controlled trial (J-START with 72,717 women), which had random assignment and was not \"very small.\" It also misses the crucial point about the lack of mortality data.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence comes from a mix of study types, including one large randomised controlled trial and several cohort studies. While the randomised trial provides high-certainty evidence for some findings, the cohort studies have limitations, such as not randomly assigning women to screening groups. This means that differences observed in these studies could sometimes be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself. Importantly, none of the studies looked at whether combined screening led to fewer deaths from breast cancer or all causes.\"\n\n3.  **Issue:** Subheadings Not Phrased as Questions\n    *   **Quote:** \"### Methods\", \"### Limitations\", \"### Currency\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The Cochrane style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to improve readability and engagement for patients.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        *   For \"### Methods\": \"### How did we do the review?\"\n        *   For \"### Limitations\": \"### What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   For \"### Currency\": \"### How up to date is this review?\"\n\n4.  **Issue:** Overly Complex Vocabulary and Noun-Heavy Sentences\n    *   **Quote:** \"The studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, with six of the eight studies screening women once, and two studies screening women once, twice, or more.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is somewhat wordy and uses nominalization (\"evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected\"). The metrics indicate a general issue with vocabulary complexity and sentence density.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies looked at how many cancers were found after one screening round. Six of the eight studies screened women once, while two studies screened women one or more times.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns for several metrics related to vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Specifically, 'nouns' (224.0, Beyond P90), 'complex_words_dc' (282.0, Beyond P90), 'nominalization' (24.0, P90), 'smog_index' (14.0, P90), 'complex_words' (128.0, P90), and 'long_words' (200.0, P90) are all higher than typical for Plain Language Summaries. This indicates the text is more dense and uses more complex vocabulary than ideal, contributing to the clarity issues noted above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While word count is within limits and some metrics like active voice and pronouns are in the best quartile, there are significant deviations in several key areas. Features deviating from typical PLS patterns include 'nominalization' (P90), 'nouns' (Beyond P90), 'smog_index' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (Beyond P90), 'complex_words' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90). These deviations suggest the text is more challenging to read than typical PLS documents due to a higher density of complex vocabulary and noun-heavy constructions."
