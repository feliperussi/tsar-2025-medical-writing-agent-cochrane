  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average‑risk women?\n\nKey Messages\n- Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected compared to mammograms alone in women at average risk of breast cancer, but it also increases the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies (a biopsy is a medical procedure where a small sample of tissue is taken from the body for examination).\n- The evidence suggests that the combination of mammography and ultrasonography may be particularly beneficial for women with dense breasts, but more research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand the long-term effects of this screening approach on breast cancer outcomes.\n- Further studies, including randomised controlled trials with longer follow-up periods, are needed to determine the potential benefits and harms of adding ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening, and to inform decisions about the best screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nWhat is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography, can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n\nWhat are the current methods for breast cancer screening and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasonography comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasonography to mammography can improve breast cancer detection rates, while others are concerned about the potential increase in false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer. They wanted to determine whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results and interval carcinomas (cancers found between scheduled screenings). They also examined the potential harms of this approach, including the risk of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasonography for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat were the main findings on breast cancer screening?\nWe found eight studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk for breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. Six of the eight studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, whilst two studies screened women once, twice, or more. The population characteristics included women between the ages of 40 and 75. The studies did not report on the funding sources or the countries in which they took place. The types of interventions and comparisons included mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening.\n\nWhat did we find?\nAdding ultrasound to mammograms probably detects more breast cancers than mammograms alone. However, it also leads to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography may detect more cancer cases than mammography alone. However, it is unclear whether this leads to a lower mortality rate. More research is needed to assess how these screening interventions affect health problems (morbidity) and death rates (mortality).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence for some outcomes, particularly from cohort studies, is less certain because these studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups. This means observed differences might be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself. However, high-certainty evidence from one large randomised trial (J-START, with 72,717 women) showed that combined screening detects more breast cancers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary is not yet ready for a lay audience. While the structure is mostly correct and the facts are accurate, the language is too technical and dense, especially in the results section. This would make it difficult for a patient to understand the key findings.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the Results Section and Remove Technical Details.** The first results paragraph is a list of study characteristics, not findings. This is confusing and overwhelming for a reader. \n   - **feedback**: \"We found eight studies that involved 209,207 women... Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This reads like the methods section of a technical paper. Terms like 'tomosynthesis' and 'ABUS' are unexplained jargon. The reader wants to know what you found, not every detail of how the studies were set up.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Remove that entire paragraph. Integrate the most important numbers into the main findings. For example, start the next section with: \"Our review included eight studies with over 209,000 women. We found that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram probably detects more breast cancers than a mammogram alone.\"\n\n2. **Replace Complex and Abstract Nouns with Simpler Verbs.** The text relies heavily on complex nouns (nominalizations) and abstract phrases, which makes it hard to read.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The evidence suggests that the combination of mammography and ultrasonography may be particularly beneficial for women with dense breasts, but more research is needed to and to understand the long-term effects of this screening approach on breast cancer outcomes.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This 39-word sentence is dense. Phrases like \"combination of mammography and ultrasonography\" and \"long-term effects of this screening approach on breast cancer outcomes\" are wordy and abstract.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Break it into shorter, more direct sentences. For example: \"Using ultrasound and mammograms together may be most helpful for women with dense breasts. However, we need more research to be sure. We also need to learn how this screening method affects women's health in the long term.\"\n\n3. **Reduce Overall Vocabulary Complexity.** The summary uses many words that are not part of everyday language, making it difficult for a layperson to understand.\n   - **Problematic Terms:** \"ultrasonography\", \"supplemental\", \"interval carcinomas\", \"morbidity\", \"mortality\".\n   - **Why it's a problem:** While you define some terms in parentheses, the sheer number of complex words makes the text feel academic and intimidating. For example, the title uses the simple term \"ultrasound,\" but the text frequently switches to the more technical \"ultrasonography.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Stick to the simplest terms consistently. Use \"ultrasound\" instead of \"ultrasonography.\" Instead of \"interval carcinomas,\" use the definition you already have: \"cancers found between scheduled screenings.\" Instead of \"morbidity and mortality,\" use your definitions: \"health problems and death rates.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some structural metrics like sentence length are good (words_per_sentence is in the best 25% of the corpus), the summary deviates significantly on vocabulary complexity. Five metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' range, indicating the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS. Specifically, the scores for SMOG index (15.1), complex words (152), and long words (239) are exceptionally high. Furthermore, the text is very noun-heavy (270 nouns, BEYOND_P90), which supports the editorial feedback to use more direct verbs and less abstract language."
