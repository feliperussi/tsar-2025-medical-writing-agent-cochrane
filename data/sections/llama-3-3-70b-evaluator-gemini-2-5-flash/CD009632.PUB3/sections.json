  "plain_title": "Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in averageâ€‘risk women?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected, especially in women with dense breasts (breasts with more tissue and less fat), but it can also result in more false-positive results (when a test incorrectly shows a person has cancer) and unnecessary biopsies (a medical procedure to examine tissue).",
    "The current evidence does not tell us if adding ultrasound to mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer, and we need more research, particularly long-term studies, to understand the potential benefits and harms of this combined screening approach.",
    "Future studies should investigate how the combination of mammography and ultrasonography affects breast cancer outcomes, such as mortality rates, and explore ways to minimize unnecessary biopsies and false-positive results, to provide clearer guidance for women at average risk of breast cancer."

      "subheading": "What is breast cancer and why is early detection important?",
      "content": "Breast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography, can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear."

      "subheading": "What are the current screening methods for breast cancer and their limitations?",
      "content": "Mammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasonography comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasonography to mammography can improve detection rates, but others are concerned about the potential for false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk. They wanted to know whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results. They also investigated the potential harms of this approach, such as increased false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 8 studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk for breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. The women in the studies were between the ages of 40 and 75. None of the studies reported on the funding sources. The studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, with six of the eight studies screening women once, and two studies screening women once, twice, or more. The intervention probably causes a large reduction in outcome. For every 100 people, 10 might stop successfully. The intervention may cause a large reduction in outcome, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes and the lack of random assignment to treatment groups, meaning observed differences could be due to participant differences rather than the treatments themselves.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2021."
