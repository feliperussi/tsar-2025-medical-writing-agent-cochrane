  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average-risk women?\n\n- Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected, especially in women with dense breasts (breasts with more tissue and less fat), but it can also result in more false-positive results (when a test incorrectly shows a person has cancer) and unnecessary biopsies (a medical procedure to examine tissue).\n- The current evidence does not tell us if adding ultrasound to mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer, and we need more research, particularly long-term studies, to understand the potential benefits and harms of this combined screening approach.\n- Future studies should investigate how the combination of mammography and ultrasonography affects breast cancer outcomes, such as mortality rates, and explore ways to minimize unnecessary biopsies and false-positive results, to provide clearer guidance for women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nWhat is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography, can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n\nWhat are the current screening methods for breast cancer and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasonography comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasonography to mammography can improve detection rates, but others are concerned about the potential for false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of adding breast ultrasound to mammograms for screening women at average risk of breast cancer. We looked at whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results. We also investigated the potential harms of this approach, such as increased false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasonography for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 8 studies with over 209,000 women who were followed for one to three years. Adding ultrasound to mammography detected more breast cancers. For example, one large study found that for every 1000 women, two more breast cancers were detected over two years when ultrasound was added. This combined screening also led to fewer false-negative results and fewer interval cancers. Additionally, women who had combined screening were less likely to have cancer spread to their lymph nodes. However, adding ultrasound also increased the number of false-positive results and led to more unnecessary biopsies. For every 1000 women without cancer, 37 more received a false-positive result with combined screening. Also, for every 1000 women, 27 more had a biopsy with combined screening compared to mammography alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence comes from a mix of study types, including one large randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies. While the randomized trial provides high-certainty evidence for some findings, the cohort studies have limitations, such as not randomly assigning women to screening groups. This means that differences observed in these studies could sometimes be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself. Importantly, none of the studies looked at whether combined screening led to fewer deaths from breast cancer or all causes.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it is not approved because a few key improvements are needed to ensure all readers can understand the information. The main issues are the use of undefined technical terms and some overly long, complex sentences.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define technical terms for the reader.** Some terms are used without explanation, which could confuse readers who are not familiar with them.\n   - **Quote:** \"This combined screening also led to fewer false-negative results and fewer interval cancers.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** A lay reader is unlikely to know what an \"interval cancer\" is. This key finding is lost if the term isn't understood.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This combined screening also led to fewer 'interval cancers' (cancers that are found between regular screening appointments).\"\n\n2. **Break up long, complex sentences.** One key message is a single 48-word sentence that contains several different ideas, making it difficult to process.\n   - **Quote:** \"Future studies should investigate how the combination of mammography and ultrasonography affects breast cancer outcomes, such as mortality rates, and explore ways to minimize unnecessary biopsies and false-positive results, to provide clearer guidance for women at average risk of breast cancer.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Long sentences with multiple clauses can be hard for readers to follow. Shorter, more focused sentences are better.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future research should check if combined screening helps women live longer. Studies also need to find ways to reduce false alarms and unnecessary biopsies. This will give women at average risk clearer guidance.\"\n\n3. **Simplify explanations of study types.** The limitations section explains study types correctly, but the language is dense and could be more direct.\n   - **Quote:** \"While the randomized trial provides high-certainty evidence for some findings, the cohort studies have limitations, such as not randomly assigning women to screening groups. This means that differences observed in these studies could sometimes be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This explanation is abstract. Using more direct language can help the reader understand why one type of evidence is stronger than another.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are more confident in some results than others. The most reliable evidence came from a 'randomized trial,' where women were randomly assigned to a screening group. Other studies were less reliable because women were not randomly assigned, meaning other factors could have influenced the results.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis. While sentence length is good overall, the analysis shows the draft uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS (SMOG Index, Complex Words, and Long Words metrics were all in the 90th percentile or beyond). Addressing the points above will help simplify the language and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity with PLS patterns for sentence structure, with metrics like 'words_per_sentence' falling in the best quartile. However, the draft deviates significantly from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics related to word difficulty—'smog_index', 'complex_words', 'long_words', 'nouns', and 'complex_words_dc'—are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates that while sentences are a good length, the choice of words is more complex than is typical for a PLS, making the text harder to read."
