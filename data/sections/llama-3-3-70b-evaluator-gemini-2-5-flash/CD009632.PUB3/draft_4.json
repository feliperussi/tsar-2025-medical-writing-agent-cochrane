  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average-risk women?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram detects more breast cancers than a mammogram alone, especially in women with dense breasts.\n- However, this combined approach also leads to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this screening method on breast cancer outcomes and to determine the best screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nWhat is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor (a tumor is a mass of abnormal cells). Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography (a mammogram is an X-ray of the breast), can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n\nWhat are the current methods for breast cancer screening and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasound comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasound to mammography can improve breast cancer detection rates, while others are concerned about the potential increase in false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies (a biopsy is a medical procedure where a small sample of tissue is taken from the body for examination).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram is a better and safer screening method than a mammogram alone. We looked at whether the combination finds more cancers and reduces the number of cancers that are missed or that appear between regular screenings.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasound for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat were the main findings on breast cancer screening?\nOur review included eight studies with over 209,000 women. Our main finding - that combined screening finds more cancers - comes from one large, well-designed study, so we have high confidence in it. However, other findings are based on studies where women were not randomly assigned to screening groups. This makes the evidence for those specific outcomes less certain. We found that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram detects more breast cancers than a mammogram alone, especially in women with dense breasts. However, this combined approach also leads to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. While we have high confidence in our main finding, other findings are less certain due to the study designs. More research, including randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up periods, is needed to assess the effects of these screening interventions on health problems and death rates.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",
