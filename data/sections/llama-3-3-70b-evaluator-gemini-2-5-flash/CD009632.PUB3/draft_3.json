  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average-risk women?\n\nKey messages:\n- Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected compared to mammograms alone in women at average risk of breast cancer, but it also increases the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n- The combination of mammography and ultrasound may be particularly beneficial for women with dense breasts, but more research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand the long-term effects of this screening approach on breast cancer outcomes.\n- Further studies, including randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up periods, are needed to determine the potential benefits and harms of adding ultrasound to mammography for breast cancer screening.\n\nWhat is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor (a tumor is a mass of abnormal cells). Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography (a mammogram is an X-ray of the breast), can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n\nWhat are the current methods for breast cancer screening and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasound comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasound to mammography can improve breast cancer detection rates, while others are concerned about the potential increase in false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies (a biopsy is a medical procedure where a small sample of tissue is taken from the body for examination).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasound for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer. We wanted to determine whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results and interval carcinomas (cancers found between scheduled screenings). We also examined the potential harms of this approach, including the risk of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasound for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat were the main findings on breast cancer screening?\nOur review included eight studies with over 209,000 women. We found that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram probably detects more breast cancers than a mammogram alone. However, it also leads to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasound may detect more cancer cases than mammography alone. However, it is unclear whether this leads to a lower mortality rate. More research is needed to assess the effects of these screening interventions on health problems and death rates.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence for some outcomes is less certain because these studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups. This means observed differences might be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself. However, high-certainty evidence from one large randomized trial showed that combined screening detects more breast cancers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of overly technical and noun-heavy language, which makes the text dense and difficult to read. Key findings are also presented with vague language that doesn't accurately reflect the certainty of the evidence, and the limitations section could be clearer. Focusing on simplifying vocabulary and being more direct will significantly improve this summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify technical language and reduce noun-heavy phrases.** The text often uses complex terms and phrasing where simpler, more direct language would be clearer for readers.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasound for breast cancer screening... We wanted to determine whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results and interval carcinomas...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like \"assess the effectiveness and safety\" and terms like \"false-negative results\" and \"interval carcinomas\" are jargon that can be difficult for a lay audience to parse, even with definitions.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram is a better and safer screening method than a mammogram alone. We looked at whether the combination finds more cancers and reduces the number of cancers that are missed or that appear between regular screenings.\"\n\n2. **State the main finding with more confidence.** The language used to describe the main result is too hesitant and doesn't reflect the high certainty of the evidence mentioned in the abstract.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We found that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram probably detects more breast cancers than a mammogram alone.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The word \"probably\" undersells the \"high certainty evidence\" from the large randomized trial. This can leave readers unsure about the most important takeaway.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our review of a large, high-quality study showed that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram detects more breast cancers than a mammogram alone.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the limitations of the evidence.** The current explanation of the limitations is confusing because it mixes discussion of weak and strong evidence without clearly distinguishing them.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence for some outcomes is less certain because these studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups... However, high-certainty evidence from one large randomized trial showed that combined screening detects more breast cancers.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This structure makes it hard for readers to understand which findings are strong and which are weak. It's better to state the high-confidence finding first and then explain the limitations of the other evidence.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence varies. Our main finding—that combined screening finds more cancers—comes from one large, well-designed study, so we have high confidence in it. However, other findings are based on studies where women were not randomly assigned to screening groups. This makes the evidence for those specific outcomes less certain.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in sentence structure (length, active voice). However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nouns' (BEYOND_P90), 'complex_words' (P90), 'long_words' (P90), and the 'smog_index' (P90) are all much higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This indicates that the draft relies too heavily on technical, multi-syllable, and noun-based words, which supports the editorial recommendation to simplify the language and use more direct, verb-driven sentences."
