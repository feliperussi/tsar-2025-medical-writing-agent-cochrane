  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average‑risk women?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected, especially in women with dense breasts (breasts with more tissue and less fat), but it can also result in more false-positive results (when a test incorrectly shows a person has cancer) and unnecessary biopsies (a medical procedure to examine tissue).\n- The current evidence does not tell us if adding ultrasound to mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer, and we need more research, particularly long-term studies, to understand the potential benefits and harms of this combined screening approach.\n- Future studies should investigate how the combination of mammography and ultrasonography affects breast cancer outcomes, such as mortality rates, and explore ways to minimize unnecessary biopsies and false-positive results, to provide clearer guidance for women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography, can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n### What are the current screening methods for breast cancer and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasonography comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasonography to mammography can improve detection rates, but others are concerned about the potential for false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk. They wanted to know whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results. They also investigated the potential harms of this approach, such as increased false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasonography for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk for breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. The women in the studies were between the ages of 40 and 75. None of the studies reported on the funding sources. The studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, with six of the eight studies screening women once, and two studies screening women once, twice, or more. \nWe found that adding ultrasound to mammography probably detects more breast cancers than mammography alone. For example, one large study found that for every 1000 women, two more breast cancers were detected over two years when ultrasound was added (5 cancers per 1000 women with combined screening versus 3 per 1000 with mammography alone).\nThis combined screening also led to fewer false-negative results (meaning fewer cancers were missed) and fewer interval cancers (cancers found between scheduled screenings). Additionally, women who had combined screening were less likely to have cancer spread to their lymph nodes.\nHowever, adding ultrasound also increased the number of false-positive results (when a test incorrectly suggests cancer) and led to more unnecessary biopsies. For every 1000 women without cancer, 37 more received a false-positive result with combined screening. Also, for every 1000 women, 27 more had a biopsy with combined screening compared to mammography alone.\nFor women with dense breasts, adding ultrasound to mammography detected more cancers. One study found three more cancers per 1000 women with dense breasts when ultrasound was added. For women with non-dense breasts, one study suggested more cancers were detected with combined screening, but other studies found no clear difference.\n\n**Limitations**\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence comes from a mix of study types, including one large randomised controlled trial and several cohort studies. While the randomised trial provides high-certainty evidence for some findings, the cohort studies have limitations, such as not randomly assigning women to screening groups. This means that differences observed in these studies could sometimes be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself. Importantly, none of the studies looked at whether combined screening led to fewer deaths from breast cancer or all causes.\n\n**Currency**\n### How up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

Additionally, several clarity and style issues need to be addressed to make the summary easier for a lay audience to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Remove the overly technical details from the start of the Results section.** The first paragraph of the 'What did we find?' section is a dense list of study characteristics that will be difficult for readers to understand and adds unnecessary length. This information is better suited for the main review.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We found 8 studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk for breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Start the section with the main findings. You can introduce the evidence base more simply, for example: \"Our review included 8 studies with over 209,000 women who were followed for one to three years.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and technical vocabulary.** The text uses many long, multi-syllable words that make it harder to read. Replacing these with simpler, everyday alternatives will significantly improve clarity.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of adding breast ultrasound to mammograms for screening women at average risk of breast cancer.\"\n\n3. **Use the active voice to make the writing more direct.** The draft frequently uses the passive voice, which can make sentences feel distant and less clear. Rewriting in the active voice makes it clearer who is performing the action.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...two more breast cancers were detected over two years when ultrasound was added...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...adding ultrasound detected two more breast cancers over two years...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These editorial suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in several key areas. The metrics for complex words, long words, and the SMOG index are all well beyond the 90th percentile, indicating high vocabulary complexity. The count of passive voice constructions is also high (P90), confirming the need for more active sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with only 22.2% of features falling in the best quartile. The draft is over the 850-word limit. There is significant deviation from typical patterns in 6 out of 18 metrics. The most critical deviations are in vocabulary complexity, with `smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, and `long_words` all rated 'BEYOND_P90'. This indicates the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS. Additionally, the `nouns` count is 'BEYOND_P90' and `passive_voice` is at 'P90', suggesting the sentence structure is overly dense and indirect."
