  "draft": "# Does adding breast ultrasound to mammograms improve cancer detection compared with mammograms alone in average‑risk women?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Adding breast ultrasound to mammograms may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected compared to mammograms alone in women at average risk of breast cancer, but it also increases the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies (a biopsy is a medical procedure where a small sample of tissue is taken from the body for examination).\n- The evidence suggests that the combination of mammography and ultrasonography may be particularly beneficial for women with dense breasts, but more research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand the long-term effects of this screening approach on breast cancer outcomes.\n- Further studies, including randomised controlled trials with longer follow-up periods, are needed to determine the potential benefits and harms of adding ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening, and to inform decisions about the best screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women worldwide. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Screening tests, such as mammography, can help detect breast cancer at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.\n### What are the current methods for breast cancer screening and their limitations?\nMammography is a widely used screening test for breast cancer. However, it may not detect all breast cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue. This is where ultrasonography comes in - a supplemental screening method that uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue. Some researchers believe that adding ultrasonography to mammography can improve breast cancer detection rates, while others are concerned about the potential increase in false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer. They wanted to determine whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone, and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results and interval carcinomas. They also examined the potential harms of this approach, including the risk of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing mammography alone to mammography with ultrasonography for breast cancer screening, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found eight studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk for breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography, one study used breast tomosynthesis, and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. Six of the eight studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, whilst two studies screened women once, twice, or more. The population characteristics included women between the ages of 40 and 75. The studies did not report on the funding sources or the countries in which they took place. The types of interventions and comparisons included mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening.\n### Main results: Breast Cancer Screening\nThe addition of ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening probably detects more breast cancer cases than mammography alone, but may also lead to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography may detect more cancer cases than mammography alone. However, it is unclear whether this leads to a lower mortality rate. More research is needed to assess the effects of these screening interventions on morbidity and mortality.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is weak because the studies were very small and lacked random assignment to treatment groups, so observed differences could be due to pre‑existing differences between participants rather than the treatments themselves.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues in factual accuracy and subheading formatting, as well as significant clarity and style problems. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy in Limitations:** The 'Limitations' section misrepresents the strength and nature of the evidence. The original abstract highlights 'High certainty evidence from one trial' involving 72,717 women, yet the draft states 'the studies were very small and lacked random assignment to treatment groups'. This is a significant factual error that misleads the reader about the robustness of the findings.\n2.  **Incorrect Subheading Format:** Several subheadings ('Methods', 'Main results: Breast Cancer Screening', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide's requirement to 'Phrase subheadings as questions where possible'.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Revise the Limitations Section for Accuracy:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The evidence is weak because the studies were very small and lacked random assignment to treatment groups, so observed differences could be due to pre‑existing differences between participants rather than the treatments themselves.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This statement is factually incorrect. The original abstract mentions a large randomised controlled trial (J-START) with high-certainty evidence for some outcomes, and a total of 209,207 women across all studies. The blanket statement that studies were 'very small' is misleading.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence for some outcomes, particularly from cohort studies, is less certain because these studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups. This means observed differences might be due to other factors rather than the screening method itself. However, high-certainty evidence from one large randomised trial (J-START, with 72,717 women) showed that combined screening detects more breast cancers.\"\n2.  **Explain Technical Jargon:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote 1:** \"...and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results and interval carcinomas. (Introduction)\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** 'Interval carcinomas' is a technical term that will not be understood by a lay audience without explanation.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite 1:** \"...and whether it can reduce the risk of false-negative results and cancers found between scheduled screenings (interval carcinomas).\"\n    *   **Problematic Quote 2:** \"More research is needed to assess the effects of these screening interventions on morbidity and mortality. (Main results)\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** 'Morbidity and mortality' are technical terms. While 'mortality' might be inferred, 'morbidity' is less common and should be explained or simplified.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite 2:** \"More research is needed to assess how these screening interventions affect health problems (morbidity) and death rates (mortality).\"\n3.  **Reduce Noun Density and Nominalization:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The addition of ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening probably detects more breast cancer cases than mammography alone, but may also lead to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This sentence is long and dense with nouns and nominalizations ('addition', 'screening', 'detection', 'results', 'biopsies'), making it harder to read.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Adding ultrasound to mammograms probably detects more breast cancers than mammograms alone. However, it also leads to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\"\n4.  **Reformat Subheadings as Questions:**\n    *   **Problematic Subheadings:** 'Methods', 'Main results: Breast Cancer Screening', 'Limitations', 'Currency'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These subheadings are statements, not questions, which goes against the Master Style Guide.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrites:**\n        *   'Methods' → 'How did we conduct the review?'\n        *   'Main results: Breast Cancer Screening' → 'What were the main findings on breast cancer screening?'\n        *   'Limitations' → 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'\n        *   'Currency' → 'How up to date is this evidence?'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The PLS evaluation results highlight significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in several areas. The high `nouns` count (265.0, BEYOND_P90, target <116.0) and `nominalization` (23.0, P90, target <13.0) directly support the need to simplify sentence structure and use more active verbs. Additionally, `smog_index` (14.87, P90), `complex_words_dc` (324.0, BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (150.0, BEYOND_P90), and `long_words` (228.0, BEYOND_P90) all indicate that the vocabulary is more complex than typical PLS texts, reinforcing the need to explain jargon and choose simpler words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The text shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While the word count is within limits and active voice and pronoun usage are good, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity and noun usage. Specifically, the count of `nouns` (265.0) is beyond the 90th percentile (BEYOND_P90), indicating a much higher density than typical PLS texts. Similarly, `complex_words_dc` (324.0), `complex_words` (150.0), and `long_words` (228.0) are all BEYOND_P90, suggesting the use of many unfamiliar, multi-syllabic, and lengthy words. `Nominalization` (23.0) and `smog_index` (14.87) are also in the P90 range, further pointing to a more complex and less readable text than desired for a plain language summary. These metrics collectively suggest that the text would benefit from simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and a more direct, verb-driven writing style to improve readability for a lay audience."
