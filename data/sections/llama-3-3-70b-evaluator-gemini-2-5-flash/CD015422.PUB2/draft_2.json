  "draft": "Do topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nKey Messages\n- Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria, a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. They looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nMethods\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating topical repellents for malaria prevention. We searched several databases, including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, and LILACS, up to January 2023. We also searched trial registration platforms and conference proceedings, and contacted organizations and companies for ongoing and unpublished trials.\n\nHow did we summarize the data?\nWe summarized the identified studies to extract their results regarding efficacy. Four review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A fifth review author resolved any disagreements.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence in the body of evidence to assess the overall effectiveness of topical repellents. We used the GRADE framework to assess the certainty of the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies, which included a total of eight trials. Six of these trials, involving up to 61,651 participants, were included in our main analysis. The studies were conducted in countries around the world and most were done in areas where malaria is less common. Most studies lasted for around several months. Pharmaceutical companies and organizations funded some of the studies. The average age and gender of the participants were not reported. The studies included people with malaria infections caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, including refugees, forest goers, and deployed military troops. The interventions used were topical repellents, and the comparisons were with or without other background interventions, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of malaria infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together. Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language, particularly in the Results and Limitations sections, is too technical and academic. The top 3 improvements needed are: 1. Simplify technical jargon and explain complex concepts in everyday terms. For example, the 'Limitations' section uses terms like 'performance bias', 'treatment allocation', 'precision', and 'generalizability' without explanation. Instead of 'The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation...', try: 'Our confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior (this is called performance bias). This makes it harder to be sure of the findings.' 2. Convert passive, noun-heavy sentences into active, direct statements. Many sentences are structured in a passive way that makes them hard to follow. For example, 'The interventions used were topical repellents, and the comparisons were with or without other background interventions...' could be rewritten as: 'In these studies, some people used topical repellents while others used no repellent or other prevention methods, like bed nets. We then compared the two groups to see if the repellents made a difference.' 3. Replace complex and long words with simpler alternatives. The text uses many multi-syllable words where shorter ones would work better, making it difficult to read. For instance, in 'Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of malaria infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together,' the phrase 'clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together' is confusing. A simpler version is: 'Using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person's chance of getting sick with malaria.' These changes will make the summary much more accessible to patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length is good (P25) and active voice is used frequently (P75), the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence construction. Metrics for complex words, long words, nouns, and the SMOG readability index are all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the language is more technical and less accessible than a typical PLS. High use of passive voice (P90) and nominalizations (P90) also contributes to this, making the text less direct and harder to understand for a lay reader."
