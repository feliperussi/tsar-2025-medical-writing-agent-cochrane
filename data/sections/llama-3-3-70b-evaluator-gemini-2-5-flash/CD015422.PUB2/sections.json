  "key_messages": [
    "Topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria (a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes) in people living in areas where malaria is common, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites (methods to prevent mosquitoes from biting, such as bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides).",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria, and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others)."

      "content": "Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. They looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 13 studies that involved 61,651 people with malaria. The studies were conducted in countries around the world and most were done in low-endemicity areas. Most studies lasted for around several months. Pharmaceutical companies and organizations funded some of the studies. The average age and gender of the participants were not reported. The studies included people with Plasmodium falciparum infections, including refugees, forest goers, and deployed military troops. The interventions used were topical repellents, and the comparisons were with or without other background interventions, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of malaria infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together. Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events. The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023."
