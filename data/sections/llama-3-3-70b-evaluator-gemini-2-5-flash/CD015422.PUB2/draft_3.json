  "draft": "Do topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria, a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) transmitted by mosquitoes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites, like bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria.\n\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. We looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria. We wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection, such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating topical repellents for malaria prevention. We searched several databases, including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, and LILACS, up to January 2023. We also searched trial registration platforms and conference proceedings, and contacted organizations and companies for ongoing and unpublished trials.\n\nHow did we summarize the data?\nWe summarized the identified studies to extract their results regarding efficacy. Four review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A fifth review author resolved any disagreements.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies, which included a total of 61,651 people with malaria. The studies were conducted in countries around the world and most were done in low-endemicity areas. Most studies lasted for around several months. Pharmaceutical companies and organizations funded some of the studies. The average age and gender of the participants were not reported. The studies included people with Plasmodium falciparum infections, including refugees, forest goers, and deployed military troops. In these studies, some people used topical repellents while others used no repellent or other prevention methods, like bed nets. We then compared the two groups to see if the repellents made a difference. Using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person's chance of getting sick with malaria. Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior. This makes it harder to be sure of the findings. Also, some studies did not report all the necessary information, and the number of people in the studies was not always large enough to give clear answers.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It contains a critical factual error and needs improvement in clarity and language simplicity before it can be published.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy**\nThe summary of findings misrepresents the evidence base.\n- **Original:** 'We found 13 studies, which included a total of 61,651 people with malaria.'\n- **Problem:** This is incorrect. The review included 8 trials (described in 13 articles), and the 61,651 participant number applies to a specific analysis of 6 of those trials, not all of them. This must be corrected for accuracy.\n- **Suggestion:** 'We found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials, which included over 61,000 people.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Language and Sentences**\nThe text is harder to read than necessary due to long words and complex phrasing, making it less accessible to a lay audience.\n- **Original:** 'The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites, like bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides.'\n- **Problem:** This sentence is long and uses words like 'potential benefits', 'access', and 'insecticides' which can be simplified.\n- **Suggestion:** 'Repellents may be most helpful for people at high risk of malaria, like refugees, who cannot use other methods like bed nets or indoor sprays to prevent mosquito bites.'\n\n**2. Clarify the 'What did we find?' Section**\nThe main results paragraph mixes study characteristics, methods, and findings, which can confuse readers.\n- **Original:** 'We found 13 studies... In these studies, some people used topical repellents while others used no repellent or other prevention methods, like bed nets. We then compared the two groups to see if the repellents made a difference. Using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person's chance of getting sick with malaria...'\n- **Problem:** This single paragraph covers too many different topics, making the key findings difficult to isolate.\n- **Suggestion:** Split this into two shorter paragraphs. First, describe the studies: 'The studies we found were conducted around the world and often included high-risk groups like refugees. In the studies, researchers compared people using repellents to people using no repellent or other methods like bed nets.' Then, state the results: 'Our analysis showed that using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person's chance of ...'\n\n**3. Make the Methods Section More Active and Clear**\nThe description of the methods is procedural and uses passive language, which is less engaging for readers.\n- **Original:** 'How did we summarize the data? We summarized the identified studies to extract their results regarding efficacy. Four review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted the data.'\n- **Problem:** This is vague ('summarized to extract results') and doesn't clearly explain the process in simple, active terms.\n- **Suggestion:** 'How did we analyze the evidence? Four of our review authors independently selected the relevant studies and pulled out the important data. We then combined the results to understand the overall effect of topical repellents.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour own instincts about simplifying the language are confirmed by the evaluation metrics. The draft has scores that are much higher than typical for a Plain Language Summary in `smog_index` (15.4), `long_words` (221), and `complex_words` (142). Addressing the suggestions above will help bring these scores into a more readable range.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many ... However, there are significant deviations from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for `smog_index`, `long_words`, `complex_words`, `complex_words_dc`, and `nouns` are all in the P90 range or beyond, indicating the text uses more complex, long, and unfamiliar words than is typical for a PLS, making it difficult for a lay audience to read."
