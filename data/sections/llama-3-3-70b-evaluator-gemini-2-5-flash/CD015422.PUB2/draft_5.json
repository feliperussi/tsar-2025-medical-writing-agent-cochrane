  "draft": "Do topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nKey messages:\n- Topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria (a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes) in people living in areas where malaria is common, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites (methods to prevent mosquitoes from biting, such as bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides).\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria, and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others).\n\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. They looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials, which included over 61,000 people. Repellents may be most helpful for people at high risk of malaria, like refugees, who cannot use other methods like bed nets or indoor sprays to prevent mosquito bites. The studies we found were conducted around the world and often included high-risk groups like refugees. In the studies, researchers compared people using repellents to people using no repellent or other methods like bed nets. Our analysis showed that using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person’s chance of getting sick with malaria. Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability. We searched several databases, including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, and LILACS, up to January 2023. Four of our review authors independently selected the relevant studies and pulled out the important data. We then combined the results to understand the overall effect of topical repellents.\n\nWhat are the implications of the findings?\nMore research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria. The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available. The evidence is up to date to January 2023. Our confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior. This makes it harder to be sure of the findings. Also, some studies did not report all the necessary information, and the number of people in the studies was not always large enough to give clear answers.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and meets the basic requirements for structure and accuracy. However, it needs significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too technical and academic, making it difficult for patients to understand the key limitations of the evidence. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify Technical Definitions:** Some definitions are as complex as the terms they are meant to explain. This can frustrate readers instead of helping them.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...to address the limitations of current studies, such as the risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others).\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The definition of 'bias' uses academic language like 'systematic error' and 'sampling', which is unlikely to be understood by a lay reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"More research is needed because the studies we found had some limitations. For example, there was a risk of bias, which means the way the studies were designed could have unfairly influenced the results.\"\n\n2. **Convert Passive, Noun-Heavy Sentences to Active Voice:** Several sentences are written in a passive, academic style that makes them long and hard to follow. Using a more direct, active voice makes it clear who is doing what.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This 36-word sentence is dense with jargon ('performance bias', 'treatment allocation', 'generalizability') and its passive structure makes it hard to digest.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior. Some studies also didn't report all their results, and others included too few people to give us a clear answer.\"\n\n3. **Remove Redundancy and Improve Structure:** The same information about the study limitations is repeated in two different sections, which is confusing and unnecessary.\n   - **Problematic text:** The limitations of the evidence are explained in detail first in the \"How reliable is the evidence?\" section and then again in the \"What are the implications of the findings?\" section.\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Repeating the same complex points in different paragraphs makes the summary longer and can leave the reader wondering if they are supposed to be learning something new.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Combine all points about the evidence limitations into a single, clearly written paragraph under the heading \"How reliable is this evidence?\". Use the simpler explanations (like the one suggested in point #2) and delete the repetitive, more technical paragraph.\n\nThese issues are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found the number of complex words, long words, and passive voice constructions were much higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, placing them in the 90th percentile or beyond.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While some metrics like active voice and pronoun use are good (in the best quartile), there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Five metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words (Dale-Chall), complex words (3+ syllables), long words, and total nouns, are beyond the 90th percentile. This indicates the text's vocabulary is substantially more complex than a typical PLS. Additionally, the use of passive voice is in the 90th percentile range, contributing to reduced readability."
