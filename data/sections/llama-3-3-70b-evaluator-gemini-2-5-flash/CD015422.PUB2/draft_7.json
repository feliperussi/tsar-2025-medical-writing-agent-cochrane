  "draft": "Do topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nKey messages:\n- Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria (a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes) in people living in areas where malaria is common, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites (methods to prevent mosquitoes from biting, such as bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides).\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria.\n\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. They looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials, which included over 61,000 people. Based on low-certainty evidence, our analysis showed that using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person’s chance of getting sick with malaria. Topical repellents are considered safe. Very few people had side effects, and these were mostly mild skin reactions.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior. Some studies also didn’t report all their results, and others included too few people to give us a clear answer.\n\nWhat are the implications of the findings?\nMore research is needed to know how well topical repellents work for different people and in different places. The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-written, but it is not approved because it fails a critical structural check: it is missing a dedicated 'Methods' section to explain how the review was conducted. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to meet Cochrane standards:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Add a 'Methods' Section.** The draft currently mixes the methods (how you found and analyzed studies) into the 'What did we find?' section. This can confuse readers. Create a new section with a question subheading to separate the process from the results.\n   - **Problem:** The sentence \"We found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials...\" appears under the 'Results' heading ('What did we find?').\n   - **Suggestion:** Create a new subheading like \"How did we conduct this review?\". Move the methods-related sentences there and rephrase for clarity. For example: \"We searched for studies...\" (example text omitted for brevity).\n\n2. **Simplify Wordy Explanations.** Some definitions are long and use complex sentence structures, which can make them hard to follow.\n   - **Problem:** \"...those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites (methods to prevent mosquitoes from biting, such as bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides).\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this more directly. For example: \"...people who cannot use other prevention methods, like insecticide-treated bed nets or indoor sprays.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the Limitations Using Active Voice.** The section on the reliability of the evidence is a bit vague and uses passive phrasing.\n   - **Problem:** \"In some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Use the active voice ('we') and be more direct to build trust with the reader. For example: \"We have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in some studies, participants knew they were using a repellent, which could have influenced their behaviour. Second, some studies did not report all their results.\"\n,",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the SMOG index (a measure of complexity) is high at 13.63 (P90), suggesting the text contains pockets of complex vocabulary that could be simplified. This aligns with the editorial feedback to reduce wordy phrases. The passive voice count of 16 is within the typical range but high enough (P75) to support the recommendation for more active phrasing in the limitations section."
