  "draft": "Do topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nKey messages:\n- Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria (a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes) in people living in areas where malaria is common, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who cannot use other prevention methods, like insecticide-treated bed nets or indoor sprays.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria.\n\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. They looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of topical repellents in preventing malaria. We looked at randomized controlled trials and cluster-randomized controlled trials that compared topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria. We also assessed the risk of bias in the included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials, which included over 61,000 people. Based on low-certainty evidence, our analysis showed that using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person’s chance of getting sick with malaria. Topical repellents are considered safe. Very few people had side effects, and these were mostly mild skin reactions.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in some studies, participants knew they were using a repellent, which could have influenced their behavior. Second, some studies did not report all their results. Third, the small sample sizes of some trials reduce the precision and generalizability of the findings.\n\nWhat are the implications of the findings?\nMore research is needed to know how well topical repellents work for different people and in different places. The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the frequent use of passive voice, unexplained technical terms, and wordy phrasing, which make the text less direct and harder to understand. Addressing these three areas will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace passive voice with active voice to make sentences more direct.** The style guide recommends using active voice (e.g., 'We found...'), but the draft often uses passive constructions.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. It's clearer to state who or what is performing the action.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Malaria is a serious disease. An infected mosquito's bite transmits a parasite (a tiny living thing) that causes it.\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical terms and research jargon.** Some terms that are common for researchers are unfamiliar to the general public.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Third, the small sample sizes of some trials reduce the precision and generalizability of the findings.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Precision' and 'generalizability' are technical research concepts. Readers may not understand why small trials are a limitation.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Third, some trials were small. This means the results might not be as accurate, and we can't be sure they would apply to everyone.\"\n\n3. **Use more concise and direct language.** Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy, which can obscure the main point.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'potential additional benefits' and 'in contexts where' make the sentence long and academic.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Topical repellents are likely less helpful when people are already using other prevention methods, like bed nets.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has a good foundation, with excellent sentence length and use of pronouns (9 metrics fall within the best quartile or median range). However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity and sentence construction. Six key metrics are in the P90 range, including passive_voice (21 instances), complex_words (130 words), and the smog_index (14.6). This pattern indicates the language is more academic and less direct than is ideal for a plain language summary, supporting the need for the suggested revisions."
