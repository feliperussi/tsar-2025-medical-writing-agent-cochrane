  "draft": "# Do topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n**Key Messages**\n- Topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria (a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes) in people living in areas where malaria is common, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites (methods to prevent mosquitoes from biting, such as bed nets or indoor spraying with insecticides).\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria, and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others).\n**Introduction**\n### What is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. They looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating topical repellents for malaria prevention.\n### Data Summarization\nThe identified studies were summarized to extract their results regarding efficacy.\n### Confidence Rating\nWe rated our confidence in the body of evidence to assess the overall effectiveness of topical repellents.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 61,651 people with malaria. The studies were conducted in countries around the world and most were done in low-endemicity areas. Most studies lasted for around several months. Pharmaceutical companies and organizations funded some of the studies. The average age and gender of the participants were not reported. The studies included people with Plasmodium falciparum infections, including refugees, forest goers, and deployed military troops. The interventions used were topical repellents, and the comparisons were with or without other background interventions, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of malaria infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together. Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events. The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft requires significant revisions to meet Cochrane Plain Language Summary guidelines. Several critical checks failed, including the formatting of subheadings and a factual clarity issue regarding study numbers. Additionally, the text contains overly long sentences, complex jargon, and excessive passive voice, which collectively hinder readability and understanding for a lay audience. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary complexity.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the Master Style Guide.\n2.  **Factual Clarity (Study Numbers):** The statement 'We found 13 studies that involved 61,651 people with malaria' is factually misleading as the participant count refers to a subset of trials, not all 13 studies.\n\n**Top 5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Search Strategy', 'Data Summarization', 'Confidence Rating', 'Limitations', 'Currency'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the Master Style Guide and making the structure less engaging for readers.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Rephrase these as questions, for example, 'How did we search for studies?', 'How did we summarize the data?', 'How confident are we in the evidence?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', and 'How up to date is this review?'\n2.  **Clarity of Study Numbers:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'We found 13 studies that involved 61,651 people with malaria.' (Results section)\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This statement is a simplification that can be misleading, as 61,651 participants refers to a subset of trials in the meta-analysis, not all 13 studies. This can confuse readers about the scope and scale of the evidence.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Clarify the numbers, for example: 'We found 13 studies, which included a total of eight trials. Six of these trials, involving up to 61,651 participants, were included in our main analysis.'\n3.  **Sentence Length and Jargon in Key Messages:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote 1:** 'Topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria (a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes) in people living in areas where malaria is common, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.'\n    *   **Problematic Quote 2:** 'More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria, and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others).'\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These sentences are excessively long and contain complex parenthetical definitions, making the key messages difficult to read and understand quickly, hindering the immediate grasp of crucial information.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite 1:** 'Topical repellents (creams or sprays that repel mosquitoes) may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria, a serious disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite 2:** 'More research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents. This is especially true for different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria. Future studies also need to address limitations, such as the risk of bias.' (Remove the complex definition of bias from the key message).\n4.  **Excessive Passive Voice:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'The identified studies were summarized to extract their results regarding efficacy.' (Methods section)\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** Frequent use of passive voice makes the text less direct and can obscure who is performing the action, reducing clarity and engagement.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Convert passive constructions to active voice. For example, 'We summarized the identified studies to extract their results regarding efficacy.'\n5.  **Unexplained Technical Terms:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'low-endemicity areas' (Results section), 'Plasmodium falciparum infections' (Results section), 'potential performance bias' (Limitations section)\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These terms are used without sufficient explanation for a lay audience, introducing jargon that can confuse readers and impede understanding of important findings and limitations.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Replace technical terms with everyday language or provide simple, concise explanations. For example, 'low-endemicity areas' could be 'areas where malaria is less common', and 'Plasmodium falciparum infections' could be 'malaria infections caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis confirms these issues, showing a high `smog_index` (BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (BEYOND_P90), and `long_words` (BEYOND_P90), indicating difficult vocabulary. `words_per_sentence` (P75) is also high, reflecting long sentences, and `passive_voice` (P90) and `nouns` (P90) are significantly above typical PLS patterns, contributing to the dense and less direct writing style.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling within the best quartile. However, 7 features deviate significantly from typical patterns. The text shows high complexity in vocabulary and sentence structure, with the `smog_index`, `complex_words`, and `long_words` metrics all falling 'BEYOND_P90', indicating a substantial number of complex and long words. `words_per_sentence` (P75) is on the higher side, suggesting longer sentences. Furthermore, `passive_voice` (P90) and `nouns` (P90) are significantly above typical ranges, pointing to an overuse of passive constructions and a noun-heavy writing style."
