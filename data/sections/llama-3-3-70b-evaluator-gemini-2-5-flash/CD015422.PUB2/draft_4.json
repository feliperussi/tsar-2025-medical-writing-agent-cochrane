  "draft": "Do topical repellents help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common? \nWe found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials, which included over 61,000 people. \nRepellents may be most helpful for people at high risk of malaria, like refugees, who cannot use other methods like bed nets or indoor sprays to prevent mosquito bites.\n\nThe studies we found were conducted around the world and often included high-risk groups like refugees. \nIn the studies, researchers compared people using repellents to people using no repellent or other methods like bed nets. \nOur analysis showed that using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person’s chance of getting sick with malaria. \nTopical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events.\n\nWe searched several databases, including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, and LILACS, up to January 2023. \nFour of our review authors independently selected the relevant studies and pulled out the important data. \nWe then combined the results to understand the overall effect of topical repellents.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023. \nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. \nIn some studies, people knew if they were using a real repellent, which might have changed their behavior. \nThis makes it harder to be sure of the findings. \nAlso, some studies did not report all the necessary information, and the number of people in the studies was not always large enough to give clear answers.\n\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite (a tiny living thing) that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. \nIt is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. \nCommon treatments for malaria include medications such as antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. \nHowever, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. \nThey looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria, and they wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection such as refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nMore research is needed to fully understand the effects of topical repellents, particularly in different groups of people and settings, to determine their role in preventing malaria.",

The text is a single block of disorganized paragraphs, missing required sections like 'Key messages' and question-based subheadings, which violates the style guide. This makes the summary very difficult for a reader to navigate. Specific issues include: 1. The entire text needs to be reorganized under standard PLS subheadings (e.g., 'What did we find?', 'How reliable is the evidence?'). 2. A dedicated 'Key messages' section is missing from the top. 3. The methods, results, and limitations are mixed together in a confusing way and must be separated into their own sections.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that the draft's sentence-level characteristics are excellent and highly conform to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges. Readability scores (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease P75), use of active voice (P75), and pronoun use (P75) are all strong. However, these positive metrics do not reflect the critical structural and organizational flaws, such as the absence of required sections and subheadings, which are the primary reasons for the 'NOT_APPROVED' grade."
