  "draft": "Can treatments that combine different approaches, such as medication, nutrition, and exercise, help manage cachexia, a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness, better than usual care?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Cachexia is a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness. Treatments that combine different approaches, like medication, nutrition, and exercise, might help manage it. However, we lack strong evidence to say if these combined treatments are better than usual care for people with chronic illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, or heart disease.\n- The current evidence does not show clear benefits or harms of multimodal interventions for cachexia management, and no unwanted or harmful effects were consistently reported, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- We need more and better research to be sure if these combined treatments can help people with cachexia.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem? \nCachexia is a serious condition that causes the body to waste away. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses like cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia unintentionally lose weight and muscle, feel fatigued, lose their appetite, and have a reduced quality of life. Cachexia is a significant problem because it can lead to a decline in physical function, strength, and overall health, making it difficult for people to perform daily activities and enjoy life.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia? \nMultimodal interventions combine two or more treatments, like medication, nutrition, and exercise. They aim to meet the complex needs of people with cachexia. These interventions might help alleviate or stabilize the symptoms of cachexia, improving physical function, strength, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, and quality of life, and reduce the symptoms of cachexia, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss. The authors also wanted to evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these interventions and identify areas for further research.\n\nHow did we do this review? \nWe searched for studies on multimodal interventions for cachexia management, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these interventions.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe included nine studies with 926 adults. The evidence for all outcomes was very uncertain. Compared to usual care, there was no clear evidence for an effect of multimodal interventions on physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, or biochemical markers. Quality of life was not reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding, as participants may have known which treatment they received.\n\nHow up to date is this review? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and structure. However, it is not yet approved because several passages are written in a formal, academic style that can be difficult for a lay audience to understand. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make the language more direct and accessible.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Use active verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).**\nSome sentences use noun forms where a direct verb would be clearer and more engaging. This makes the text feel dense.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Cachexia is a significant problem because it can lead to a **decline in** physical function, strength, and overall health...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"a decline in\" is indirect. Using a simple verb makes the sentence stronger.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Cachexia is a significant problem because it can **weaken** physical function, strength, and overall health...\"\n\n**2. Replace complex words with simpler, everyday alternatives.**\nThe text uses some words that readers may not be familiar with, which can hinder understanding.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"These interventions might help **alleviate** or **stabilize** the symptoms of cachexia...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Alleviate\" and \"stabilize\" are technical terms. Simpler words will make the meaning clearer to more people.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"These combined treatments might help **ease** the symptoms of cachexia or **stop them from getting worse**...\"\n\n**3. Be more concise and avoid repetition.**\nSome sections repeat information or use more words than necessary, which can make the key messages harder to grasp.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The current evidence does not show clear benefits or harms of multimodal interventions for cachexia management, and no unwanted or harmful effects were consistently reported, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 34-word sentence is repetitive. It states there's no clear evidence three different ways.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are very uncertain about the benefits and harms of these combined treatments. The studies did not show clear effects, either helpful or harmful.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, with excellent sentence length (17.6 words) and low use of passive voice. However, several key metrics deviate significantly from the typical range, supporting the need for revision. The 'nominalization' score is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating a high use of noun-heavy phrases. The 'smog_index' and 'long_words' count are also in the 90th percentile, confirming the presence of complex vocabulary that reduces readability. Focusing on these areas will bring the text more in line with plain language best practices."
