  "key_messages": [
    "Cachexia (a condition where the body wastes away due to a chronic illness, such as cancer, HIV, or heart disease) management through combined medication, nutrition, and exercise treatments may have benefits, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear what these benefits and risks are, and no harmful effects were reported in the available studies.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting methodologically rigorous, well-powered studies with adequate interaction times to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia across different chronic illnesses, as the current evidence is very uncertain.",
    "More studies are needed to provide clear answers about the best ways to manage cachexia, including the potential benefits and harms of different treatment approaches, and to address the significant gaps in knowledge that currently exist."

      "subheading": "What is cachexia and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome that occurs in people with chronic illnesses, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is characterized by unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. Cachexia is a significant problem because it can lead to a decline in physical function, strength, and overall health, making it difficult for people to perform daily activities and enjoy life."

    {
      "subheading": "What are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia?",
      "content": "Multimodal interventions are treatments that combine two or more different approaches, such as pharmacology, nutrition, and exercise, to manage a condition. In the case of cachexia, multimodal interventions aim to alleviate or stabilize the syndrome by addressing its various aspects, such as weight loss, muscle wasting, and fatigue. These interventions may involve a combination of medications, nutritional supplements, physical activity, and other therapies tailored to the individual's needs."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, quality of life, and other outcomes, while also considering potential adverse events. The authors sought to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of multimodal interventions in alleviating or stabilizing cachexia, and to inform healthcare decisions for people affected by this condition."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 9 studies that involved 926 adults with a mean age of 63 years. The studies were conducted in several countries, with 6 studies in Europe, and 1 each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. The studies lasted from 6 weeks to 7 months. Six studies were conducted in people with cancer, and 1 each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The interventions compared were multimodal interventions, including pharmacological, nutritional, and/or exercise interventions, compared to treatment as usual, variation of the intervention, or unimodal intervention. The review found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia. It is unclear if multimodal interventions have an effect on outcomes such as physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, and biochemical markers."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding, as participants may have known which treatment they received.",
