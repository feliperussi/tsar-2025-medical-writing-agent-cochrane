  "draft": "Can combined treatments like medication, nutrition, and exercise help manage cachexia, a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness, better than usual care? We looked at studies that combined two or more of these approaches to see if they could improve physical function, strength, and quality of life for people with cachexia. \n- We are very uncertain if combining treatments is better than usual care for managing cachexia.\n- The evidence did not show any clear benefits or harms for these combined treatments.\n- More and better research is needed to understand if these treatments can help people with cachexia.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem? \nCachexia is a serious condition that causes the body to waste away. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses like cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia lose weight and muscle without trying to, feel very tired, lose their appetite, and find it harder to enjoy life.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia? \nMultimodal interventions combine two or more treatments, like medication, nutrition, and exercise. They aim to meet the complex needs of people with cachexia. These interventions might help ease the symptoms of cachexia or stop them from getting worse, improving physical function, strength, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. We aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, and quality of life, and reduce the symptoms of cachexia.\n\nHow did we do this review? \nWe searched for studies on multimodal interventions for cachexia management, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe included 9 studies with 926 adults. The evidence for all outcomes was very uncertain. Compared to usual care, we found no clear evidence that combined treatments affected people's physical function, strength, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding.\n\nHow up to date is this review? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft is not approved due to a critical factual error in the results section. Additionally, several areas could be improved for clarity and consistency.\n\n**1. Critical: Correct Factual Inaccuracy in Results**\n- **The problem:** The results section incorrectly states that the review assessed 'quality of life' for the comparison against usual care.\n- **Original sentence:** 'Compared to usual care, we found no clear evidence that combined treatments affected people's physical function, strength, or quality of life.'\n- **Why it's wrong:** The source abstract explicitly states 'QoL was not reported' for this comparison.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Compared to usual care, we found no clear evidence that combined treatments affected people's physical function or strength. The study did not report on quality of life.'\n\n**2. Explain Technical Terms in Limitations**\n- **The problem:** The term 'blinding' is unexplained jargon that a lay reader may not understand.\n- **Original sentence:** 'The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included small numbers of people. Also, in most studies, people likely knew which treatment they were receiving (a problem known as a lack of \"blinding\"), which can affect the results.'\n\n**3. Improve Consistency of Active Voice**\n- **The problem:** The key messages use an impersonal tone ('The evidence did not show...') which is less direct than the 'we' voice used elsewhere and recommended by the style guide.\n- **Original sentence:** '- The evidence did not show any clear benefits or harms for these combined treatments.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** '- We did not find any clear benefits or harms from these combined treatments.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling into the best quartile. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (8.73) and Words Per Sentence (15.27) are excellent, indicating the text is structurally simple and easy to read. The high use of active voice and personal pronouns also aligns with best practices. The metrics do not flag any stylistic issues; the required edits relate to factual accuracy and nuanced clarity, which are beyond the scope of statistical analysis."
