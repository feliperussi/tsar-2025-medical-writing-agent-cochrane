  "draft": "Can combined treatments like medication, nutrition, and exercise help manage cachexia, a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness, better than usual care? We looked at studies that combined two or more of these approaches to see if they could improve physical function, strength, and quality of life for people with cachexia.\n- We did not find any clear benefits or harms from these combined treatments.\n- The evidence did not show any clear benefits or harms for these combined treatments.\n- More and better research is needed to understand if these treatments can help people with cachexia.\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem? \nCachexia is a serious condition that causes the body to waste away. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses like cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia lose weight and muscle without trying to, feel very tired, lose their appetite, and find it harder to enjoy life.\nWhat are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia? \nMultimodal interventions combine two or more treatments, like medication, nutrition, and exercise. They aim to meet the complex needs of people with cachexia. These interventions might help ease the symptoms of cachexia or stop them from getting worse, improving physical function, strength, and quality of life.\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. We aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, and quality of life, and reduce the symptoms of cachexia.\nHow did we do this review? \nWe searched for studies on multimodal interventions for cachexia management, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\nWhat did we find? \nWe included 9 studies with 926 adults. The evidence for all outcomes was very uncertain. Compared to usual care, we found no clear evidence that combined treatments affected people's physical function or strength. The study did not report on quality of life.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the studies included small numbers of people. Also, in most studies, people likely knew which treatment they were receiving (a problem known as a lack of \"blinding\"), which can affect the results.\nHow up to date is this review? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and meets all critical requirements for structure and accuracy. However, it is not yet approved because a few key areas need improvement to make the summary as clear as possible for readers. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n**1. Remove Redundancy in the Key Messages**\nThe first two bullet points say the same thing, which can be confusing for readers.\n- **Original Text:**\n> - We did not find any clear benefits or harms from these combined treatments.\n> - The evidence did not show any clear benefits or harms for these combined treatments.\n- **Suggestion:** Combine and clarify the key messages to be distinct and informative. For example:\n> - It is unclear if treatments combining medication, nutrition, and exercise help people with cachexia because of a lack of strong evidence.\n> - We did not find clear benefits or harms for these combined treatments compared to usual care or single treatments.\n> - More and better research is needed to provide a clear answer.\n\n**2. Make the 'What did we find?' Section More Specific**\nThe current results section is a bit too general and only seems to refer to one part of the analysis (comparison to usual care). This could be misleading as the review made several comparisons.\n- **Original Text:**\n> Compared to usual care, we found no clear evidence that combined treatments affected people's physical function or strength. The study did not report on quality of life.\n- **Suggestion:** Broaden the summary to reflect the review's overall findings across all comparisons, while keeping it simple.\n> When we compared the combined treatments to usual care or to single treatments, we found no clear evidence that they improved people's physical function, strength, or other outcomes. Overall, the evidence for all outcomes was very uncertain.\n\n**3. Use More Direct, Action-Oriented Language**\nSome sentences use noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'assessment' instead of 'assess'), which can make them less direct. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis.\n- **Original Text:**\n> We wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia... We aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function...\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase with more direct verbs to make the text more engaging and easier to follow.\n> We wanted to find out if combined treatments for cachexia help or harm people with chronic illnesses. We looked at whether these treatments improve physical function, strength, and quality of life.\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nThe draft is generally very readable, with excellent sentence length and low use of passive voice. However, the analysis identified a high number of 'nominalizations' (21 instances), which supports the recommendation to use more direct verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) are in the best quartile for readability, including excellent scores for sentence length (15.14 words/sentence) and low passive voice (7 instances). However, the analysis flagged one metric for review: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs) is in the 90th percentile with 21 instances. This suggests the text could be made more direct and easier to read by replacing noun phrases with active verbs."
