  "draft": "Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer\nWe looked at how to prepare the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer. This is a technique used to help people conceive, where an embryo that has been previously frozen is transferred into the uterus.\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that the benefits and risks of different methods to prepare the uterus are unclear. This is because there is not enough strong evidence.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between these methods. But the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions.\n- More research is needed to understand the effects of these methods on live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other important outcomes.\n\nWhat is Frozen-Thawed Embryo Transfer and Why is it Important\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment. It involves thawing a frozen embryo and transferring it into a woman's womb. FET is becoming increasingly popular because it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake.\n\nWhat are the Different Cycle Regimens for FET and How do They Work\nThere are several methods used to prepare the uterus for FET. These include natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation.\n\nWhat Did the Review Authors Want to Find Out\nThe review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different methods to prepare the uterus for FET. They also wanted to investigate the effects of using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression in combination with HT FET.\n\nHow Did We Find the Evidence\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared different methods to prepare the uterus for FET. We identified relevant trials and observational studies. From each eligible study, we extracted key outcomes, participant characteristics, and details of the methods used.\n\nWhat Did We Find\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different methods to prepare the uterus, including natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. The evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide. This makes it unclear if one method is more effective and safer than another.\n\nLimitations of the Evidence\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency of the Evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we need more research to determine the best method to prepare the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer. The current evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between the different methods. We hope that this information will help people make informed decisions about their fertility treatment.",
