  "draft": "Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer and the Most Effective Method\n\nKey Messages:\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer are unclear.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle regimens.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these cycle regimens in well-designed studies to help people make informed decisions about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer.\n\nWhat is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb. FET is becoming more common because it can increase the chance of getting pregnant over time, costs less, and is a fairly simple procedure. However, there are different ways to prepare the womb for FET, and it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method.\n\nWhat are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones (chemicals that help control body functions) to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to understand how they work to determine the best approach.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET, including natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET. They also wanted to investigate the effects of using another drug that suppresses the body's natural hormones in combination with HT FET. The authors sought to determine which cycle regimen is most effective in achieving live births, reducing miscarriages, and minimizing adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different ways of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer. We looked at studies that compared natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. However, the evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide, making it unclear if one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another. For every 100 people undergoing frozen embryo transfer, the chance of a live birth may be similar across different cycle regimens, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest. This means that we cannot be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot be certain which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer, as the current evidence does not show a clear difference between them. More well-designed research that measures important outcomes, like live birth and miscarriage rates, is needed to help people make informed decisions about their treatment.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is factually accurate, complete, and within the word count limit. However, it is not approved because several issues with vocabulary and sentence structure make it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing very high use of complex words and abstract nouns (nominalizations), which makes the text dense and overly formal.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns (nominalizations) with active verbs.** The text relies heavily on noun forms of verbs, which makes it dense and less direct. This is the most important issue to fix.\n    *   **Example:** '...to help people make informed decisions about the best approach...'\n    *   **Problem:** 'make decisions' is an abstract phrase. Using a direct verb is clearer and more engaging.\n    *   **Suggestion:** '...to help people decide on the best approach...'\n\n2. **Simplify complex terms and statistical jargon.** Some phrases are too technical for a plain language summary without a simple explanation.\n    *   **Example:** '...the evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide...'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Confidence intervals' is statistical jargon that will be meaningless to most readers.\n    *   **Suggestion:** '...the evidence was often of low certainty. This means we cannot be confident in the results, and the true effect could be very different from what the studies found.'\n\n3. **Reduce wordiness and formal phrasing.** Several sentences use formal, wordy phrases that can be made more concise and direct, as recommended by the style guide.\n    *   **Example:** '...it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is a passive and wordy way to state the goal.\n    *   **Suggestion:** '...we need to find the most effective and safest method.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and some readability scores are good (P25-P50), there are significant deviations in vocabulary and structure. Six metrics are in the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range. Specifically, the text has an extremely high number of nominalizations (BEYOND_P90), and high counts of nouns, complex words, and long words (P90). This indicates the text is too dense and uses overly formal language, which will make it difficult for a lay audience to read."
