  "draft": "Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer and the Most Effective Method\n\nWe looked at how to prepare the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer - a technique used to help people conceive, where an embryo that has been previously frozen is transferred into the uterus. \n\nKey messages:\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of different cycle regimens (methods to prepare the uterus) for frozen embryo transfer are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between these regimens, but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions, and more research is needed to understand their effects on live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other important outcomes.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these cycle regimens in well-designed studies that report important outcomes, such as live birth rates and miscarriage rates, to help people make informed decisions about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence.\n\nWhat is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb. FET is becoming increasingly popular as it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake. However, there are different ways to prepare the womb for FET, and it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method.\n\nWhat are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation. Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to understand how they work to determine the best approach.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET, including natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET. They also wanted to investigate the effects of using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression in combination with HT FET. The authors sought to determine which cycle regimen is most effective in achieving live births, reducing miscarriages, and minimizing adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer, identifying relevant trials and observational studies. From each eligible study, we extracted key outcomes, participant characteristics, and details of the cycle regimens used, summarizing the results in a comparative format.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy (HT) cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. The evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide, making it unclear if one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another. For every 100 people undergoing frozen embryo transfer, the chance of a live birth may be similar across different cycle regimens, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we need more research to determine the best method to prepare the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer. The current evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between the different methods. We hope that this information will help people make informed decisions about their fertility treatment.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails on two critical checks: factual accuracy and formatting. The methods section incorrectly states that observational studies were included, when the review was limited to randomised controlled trials. Additionally, the main title and two subheadings are not phrased as questions, which violates the style, and beyond these critical issues, the text is difficult for a lay audience to understand due to a high number of complex words and long sentences.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Factual Error in the Methods:** The description of the search is inaccurate and misrepresents the type of evidence included.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We performed a systematic search for studies that compared different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer, identifying relevant trials and observational studies.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** The original abstract clearly states, \"We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\". Including \"observational studies\" is a factual error.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different ways of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer.\"\n\n2. **Rephrase Title and Subheadings as Questions:** The main title and two subheadings do not follow the required question-based format, which makes the summary harder to navigate.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer and the Most Effective Method\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n   - **Reasoning:** The style guide requires all titles and subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrites:** \"What is the best way to prepare the womb for a frozen embryo transfer?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n3. **Simplify Complex Language and Define Acronyms:** The text uses multiple technical terms and acronyms without clear, simple definitions, which will confuse readers.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"They also wanted to investigate the effects of using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression in combination with HT FET.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This sentence is filled with jargon. A patient is unlikely to know what GnRHa, suppression, or HT FET are. This is supported by the evaluation results, which show the complex word count is beyond the 90th percentile.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also looked at whether adding a specific drug (called a GnRHa) to hormone therapy made a difference.\"\n\n4. **Break Up Long, Complex Sentences:** Several sentences are over 30 and combine multiple ideas, making them difficult to follow.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Future research should focus on comparing these cycle regimens in well-designed studies that report important outcomes, such as live birth rates and miscarriage rates, to help people make informed decisions about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This 52-word sentence is overwhelming. It should be broken into several shorter sentences, each focusing on a single idea.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"More research is needed to be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfers. Future studies should be well-designed and compare the different methods. They should also measure important outcomes like live birth and miscarriage rates. This will help people make more informed decisions about their treatment.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns, but reveals significant issues with vocabulary complexity. The SMOG index (BEYOND_P90), complex word count (BEYOND_P90), and long word count (BEYOND_P90) are all exceptionally high, indicating the text is much more difficult to read than a typical PLS. Furthermore, the rates of passive voice (P90) and nominalizations (P90) are high, contributing to a less direct and clear style. These metrics support the editorial judgment that the draft needs significant simplification to be accessible to a lay audience."
