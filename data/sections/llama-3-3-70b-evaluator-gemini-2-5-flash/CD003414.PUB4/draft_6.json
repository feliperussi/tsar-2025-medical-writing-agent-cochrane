  "draft": "Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer and the Most Effective Method\n\nKey Messages:\n- We do not know which method is best for preparing the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle regimens.\n- We need more research to compare these methods and help people make informed decisions about their treatment.\n\nWhat is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb. FET is becoming more common because it can increase the chance of getting pregnant over time, costs less, and is a fairly simple procedure. We need to find the most effective and safest method to prepare the womb for FET.\n\nWhat are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones (chemicals that help control body functions) to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET. They also wanted to investigate the effects of using another drug that suppresses the body's natural hormones in combination with HT FET. The authors sought to determine which cycle regimen is most effective in achieving live births, reducing miscarriages, and minimizing adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different ways of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer. We looked at studies that compared natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. However, the evidence was often of low certainty. This means we cannot be confident in the results, and the true effect could be very different from what the studies found. For every 100 people undergoing frozen embryo transfer, the chance of a live birth may be similar across different cycle regimens, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest. This means we cannot be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot be certain which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer, as the current evidence does not show a clear difference between them. We need more well-designed research that measures important outcomes, like live birth and miscarriage rates, to help people make informed decisions about their treatment.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience and to meet key style guide requirements. The main title is not phrased as a question, which is a critical formatting issue. Additionally, several sections use complex, technical language and noun-heavy phrases that make the text harder to read than necessary. Clarifying the main finding about the uncertainty of the evidence will also help readers better understand the review's conclusion.\n\n**Critical Issue: Title Format**\nThe main title must be phrased as a question to meet style guide requirements.\n- **Current Title:** \"Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer and the Most Effective Method\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What is the best way to prepare the womb for transferring a frozen embryo?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify complex and technical language.**\nSome sentences are filled with formal words and jargon that can be replaced with simpler, everyday language.\n- **quote:** \"The authors sought to determine which cycle regimen is most effective in achieving live births, reducing miscarriages, and minimizing adverse effects.\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** Words like 'determine', 'regimen', 'achieving', and 'minimizing' are unnecessarily complex. \"Adverse effects\" is medical jargon for side effects or harms.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to know which method was best for having a baby, lowering the chance of miscarriage, and causing the fewest side effects.\"\n\n**2. Use direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).**\nThe text often uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences longer and less direct. Using simple verbs makes the writing more active and easier to understand.\n- **Quote:** \"...to help people make informed decisions about their treatment.\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** \"Make a decision\" is a common but wordy phrase. The verb \"decide\" is more direct and concise.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...to help people decide on the best treatment for them.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the main finding about the evidence.**\nThe sentence summarizing the results is confusing because and introduces a quantitative concept (\"For every 100 people\") without providing any numbers, which obscures the core message of uncertainty.\n- **Quote:** \"For every 100 people undergoing frozen embryo transfer, the chance of a live birth may be similar across different cycle regimens, but the results are very uncertain.\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** This phrasing mixes a potential finding (similarity) with a statement of uncertainty in a way that is hard to follow. It's clearer to state the finding and then explain the low confidence in it.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The results suggest there may be little or no difference in the chance of a live birth between the different methods. However, we cannot be confident in this finding because the evidence was of low certainty.\"\n\nThis feedback is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nominalizations, long words, and complex words, indicating that vocabulary simplification is a key area for improvement.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to many typical patterns, with 77.8% of features in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics are in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), long words, and complex words (based on the SMOG and Dale-Chall indices). These metrics support the need to simplify language and sentence structure."
