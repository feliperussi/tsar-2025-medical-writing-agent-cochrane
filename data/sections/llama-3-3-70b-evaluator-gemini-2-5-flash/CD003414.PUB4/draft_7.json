  "draft": "What is the best way to prepare the womb for transferring a frozen embryo?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not know which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle regimens.\n- We need more research to compare these methods and help people decide on the best treatment for them.\n\nWhat is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb. FET is becoming more common because it can increase the chance of getting pregnant over time, costs less, and is a fairly simple procedure. We need to find the most effective and safest method to prepare the womb for FET.\n\nWhat are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones (chemicals that help control body functions) to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which method was best for having a baby, lowering the chance of miscarriage, and causing the fewest side effects. We compared the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different ways of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer. We looked at studies that compared natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. However, the evidence was often of low certainty. This means we cannot be confident in the results, and the true effect could be very different from what the studies found.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest. This means we cannot be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot be certain which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer, as the current evidence does not show a clear difference between them. The results suggest there may be little or no difference in the chance of a live birth between the different methods. However, we cannot be confident in this finding because the evidence was of low certainty. We need more well-designed research that measures important outcomes, like live birth and miscarriage rates, to help people decide on the best treatment for them.",

I am flagging it as 'NOT_APPROVED' to provide a few specific suggestions that will make an already strong draft even more direct and accessible for patients. My feedback focuses on simplifying a key definition and replacing a few abstract, noun-heavy phrases with more active, verb-focused language.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the definition of FET to remove redundancy.**\n   - **The issue:** The first sentence of the background explains what is already stated in the term 'Frozen-thawed embryo transfer'.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Frozen embryo transfer (FET) is a fertility treatment where a previously frozen embryo is placed into a woman's womb.\"\n\n2. **Replace vague research terms with concrete examples.**\n   - **The issue:** The limitations section uses the phrase 'outcomes of interest', which is research jargon. It's more helpful for readers if you name the specific outcomes that matter to them.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were small and many did not report on important results, such as live birth or miscarriage rates.\"\n\n3. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of noun phrases.**\n   - **The issue:** The linguistic analysis noted a high number of 'nominalizations' (27 instances). This means verbs are sometimes turned into abstract nouns (e.g., 'preparation' instead of 'prepare'), making sentences less direct. While many of these are necessary technical terms (like 'ovulation induction'), a few could be more active.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"HT FET uses hormones (chemicals that help control body functions) to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In a hormone therapy (HT) cycle, doctors use hormones to prepare the womb. In an ovulation induction cycle, they use drugs to help the ovaries release eggs (ovulation).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 88.9% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Key strengths include short sentences (16.7 words/sentence), simple vocabulary (Grade 9 Flesch-Kincaid), and strong use of active voice. The single significant deviation is in 'nominalization' (P90), with 27 instances detected. This indicates a higher-than-usual number of noun-form verbs, which can sometimes make sentences less direct, supporting the editorial feedback to focus on more active phrasing where possible."
