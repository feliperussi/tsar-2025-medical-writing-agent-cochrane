  "draft": "# Best Ways to Prepare the Uterus for a Frozen Embryo Transfer and the Most Effective Method\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of different cycle regimens (methods to prepare the uterus) for frozen embryo transfer (a technique used to help people conceive, where an embryo that has been previously frozen is transferred into the uterus), including natural cycle, hormone therapy (hormones given as treatment) cycle, and ovulation induction (stimulating the release of eggs from the ovaries) cycle, are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between these regimens, but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions, and more research is needed to understand their effects on live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other important outcomes.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these cycle regimens in well-designed studies that report important outcomes, such as live birth rates and miscarriage rates, to help people make informed decisions about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer, and to address the current uncertainty and limitations in the evidence.\n**Introduction**\n### What is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb. FET is becoming increasingly popular as it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake. However, there are different ways to prepare the womb for FET, and it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method.\n### What are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation. Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to understand how they work to determine the best approach.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET, including natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET. They also wanted to investigate the effects of using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression in combination with HT FET. The authors sought to determine which cycle regimen is most effective in achieving live births, reducing miscarriages, and minimizing adverse effects.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer, identifying relevant trials and observational studies.\n### Data Extraction\nFrom each eligible study we extracted key outcomes, participant characteristics, and details of the cycle regimens used, summarizing the results in a comparative format.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe evaluated the overall confidence in the body of evidence using a structured rating approach, considering factors such as risk of bias, consistency, and precision of the findings.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy (HT) cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific locations were not mentioned. The population characteristics, such as age and severity of condition, were not reported. The studies compared the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens, including natural cycle FET versus HT FET, natural cycle FET versus HT plus GnRHa suppression, and modified natural cycle FET versus HT FET. The funding sources for the studies were not mentioned. The review found that there is probably little to no difference in the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer, including natural cycle, hormone therapy, and modified natural cycle with human chorionic gonadotrophin trigger. The evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide, making it unclear if one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another. For every 100 people undergoing frozen embryo transfer, the chance of a live birth may be similar across different cycle regimens, but the results are very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

The text contains overly long and complex sentences, excessive passive voice and nominalization, and a high density of complex vocabulary, making it difficult for a patient audience to understand. These issues are strongly supported by the linguistic analysis.",

A large number of metrics (13 out of 18) are in the P90 or Beyond P90 range, suggesting substantial issues with readability and clarity. Key areas of concern include very high 'words_per_sentence' (27.48, P90), 'passive_voice' (26.00, BEYOND_P90), 'nominalization' (32.00, BEYOND_P90), and 'nouns' (230.00, BEYOND_P90). All readability indices ('flesch_kincaid_grade', 'automated_readability_index', 'gunning_fog_index', 'lix', 'rix', 'smog_index') are significantly higher than typical, while 'flesch_reading_ease' is notably lower (36.91, P25). Vocabulary complexity metrics ('complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', 'long_words') are also much higher than typical PLS texts, confirming the need for simplification."
