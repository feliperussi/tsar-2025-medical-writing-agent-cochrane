  "draft": "What is the best way to prepare the womb for a frozen embryo transfer?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's womb. FET is becoming increasingly popular as it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake. However, there are different ways to prepare the womb for FET, and it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method.\n\nWhat are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. HT FET uses hormones (chemicals that help control body functions) to prepare the womb, while ovulation induction FET uses drugs to stimulate ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to understand how they work to determine the best approach.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET, including natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET. They also wanted to investigate the effects of using a specific drug (called a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist or GnRHa) in combination with HT FET. The authors sought to determine which cycle regimen is most effective in achieving live births, reducing miscarriages, and minimizing adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different ways of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer. We looked at studies that compared natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET, as well as studies that used a GnRHa in combination with HT FET.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. However, the evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide, making it unclear if one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another. For every 100 people undergoing frozen embryo transfer, the chance of a live birth may be similar across different cycle regimens, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not report all outcomes of interest. This means that we cannot be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we need more research to determine the best method to prepare the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer. The current evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between the different methods. We hope that this information will help people make informed decisions about their fertility treatment. More research is needed to be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfers. Future studies should be well-designed and compare the different methods. They should also measure important outcomes like live birth and miscarriage rates. This will help people make more informed decisions about their treatment.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it is not approved because it's missing a critical 'Key Messages' section and has several clarity issues that need to be addressed. Here are the most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Add a 'Key Messages' Section.**\nThe summary must begin with a 'Key Messages' section that provides the main takeaways for the reader. Please add this section before the main text, based on the information in the 'SOURCE_OF_TRUTH'.\n\n2. **Simplify Complex and Technical Language.**\nThe text uses several technical terms and abstract nouns that can be confusing for a general audience. This is supported by the high number of complex words and nominalizations found in the analysis.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"FET is becoming increasingly popular as it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Cumulative pregnancy rate' is jargon, and 'undertake' is a formal word.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"FET is becoming more common because it can increase the chance of getting pregnant over time, costs less, and is a fairly simple procedure.\"\n\n3. **Make the Conclusion Clear and Concise.**\nThe final two paragraphs are repetitive and say the same thing in slightly different ways, which can weaken the main message.\n- **Problematic text:** \"In conclusion, we need more research... The current evidence does not show a clear difference... More research is needed to be certain... Future studies should be well-designed... This will help people make more informed decisions...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Repeating the same point reduces clarity and impact.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"In conclusion, we cannot be certain which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer, as the current evidence does not show a clear difference between them. More well-designed research that measures important outcomes, like live birth and miscarriage rates, is needed to help people make informed decisions about their treatment.\"\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Technical Detail.**\nIntroducing long, technical drug names adds complexity without improving the reader's understanding of the overall results, which were uncertain.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"They also wanted to investigate the effects of using a specific drug (called a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist or GnRHa) in combination with HT FET.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The full drug name is intimidating and not essential for understanding the summary's conclusion.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"They also wanted to investigate the effects of using another drug that suppresses the body's natural hormones in combination with hormone therapy.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns for sentence length and voice, with 67% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly on vocabulary complexity. Five metrics, including nominalization (P90), complex_words (P90), long_words (P90), and the smog_index (P90), are in the highest ranges, indicating the text uses more abstract, long, and technical words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing this will significantly improve readability."
