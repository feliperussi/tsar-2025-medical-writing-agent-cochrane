  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey Messages\n- We looked at four types of 'regional pain blocks' (injections to numb a specific area):\n  - Paravertebral block: an injection near the spine.\n  - Erector spinae plane block: an injection near the back muscles.\n  - Pectoral nerve block: an injection near the chest nerves.\n  - Serratus anterior plane block: an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.\n  Our review suggests these methods are comparable for reducing pain and complications after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions.\n- No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\nPain after breast cancer surgery and how it is treated\nPostoperative pain is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. These techniques can help reduce pain and discomfort, but they can also have risks and side effects. There are several types of regional analgesia techniques that can be used to manage postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, including paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body to block pain signals to the brain.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which regional analgesia techniques are most effective in reducing postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, and whether these techniques have any risks or side effects. They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of different techniques, such as PVB, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB, in reducing postoperative pain and improving quality of life for people who have had breast cancer surgery.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that all four regional pain block techniques were comparable for reducing pain after surgery. This means they provided similar levels of pain relief. No harmful effects were reported in the studies we looked at. Our findings are based on 39 studies involving 2348 women who had breast cancer surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because:\n- the studies included only a small number of people;\n- there were not enough studies to be certain about the results;\n- the studies used different methods and included different types of people.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs a few revisions to meet our standards for clarity and style. It has been marked as NOT_APPROVED due to a critical formatting issue and several opportunities to improve readability for patients.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n*   **One subheading is not a question.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader.\n    *   **Current Subheading:** 'Pain after breast cancer surgery and how it is treated'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Please rephrase this as a question. For example: 'What is pain after breast cancer surgery and how is it treated?'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the introduction of the four techniques.** The sentence listing the four block types is long and noun-heavy, which can be hard for readers to follow.\n    *   **Current Sentence:** 'There are several types of regional analgesia techniques that can be used to manage postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, including paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Doctors can use several types of these injections. This review looked at four main types: paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).'\n\n2.  **Use a more direct, active voice in the 'Aims' section.** The current text is repetitive and uses 'The review authors' instead of the preferred 'we'.\n    *   **Current Text:** 'The review authors wanted to find out which regional analgesia techniques are most effective in reducing postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery... They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of different techniques...'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We wanted to find out which of these four pain blocks works best to reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for any risks or side effects.'\n\n3.  **Make the limitations more specific.** The current description of the limitations is vague and less helpful for the reader.\n    *   **Current Bullet Point:** '- the studies used different methods and included different types of people.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** '- the studies delivered the pain blocks in different ways and included people who had different types of surgery.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nThe linguistic analysis supports the need for these changes. While most readability scores are excellent, the noun count is unusually high (in the 90th percentile). The suggested edits will help by replacing noun phrases (e.g., 'compare the effectiveness of') with more direct verbs, making the text more engaging and easier to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores and sentence length are excellent. However, the analysis identified a significant deviation: the noun count (169) is much higher than typical for a PLS (in the P90 range), suggesting the text may be overly formal and less reliant on action verbs."
