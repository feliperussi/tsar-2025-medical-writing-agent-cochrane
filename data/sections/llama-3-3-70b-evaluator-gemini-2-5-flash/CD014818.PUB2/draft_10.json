  "draft": "# What are the best pain relief methods after breast cancer surgery, and how do they compare in reducing pain and complications?\n**Key Messages**\n- Regional analgesia techniques (methods to numb parts of the body to stop pain) such as paravertebral block (PVB, a type of numbing injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, a type of numbing injection in the back muscles), pectoral nerve block (PEC, a type of numbing injection near the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, a type of numbing injection near the side muscles) seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain (pain after surgery) and rates of complications (unwanted effects) after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to confirm this for all types of pain and complications.\n- The review found that these techniques may have similar effectiveness for reducing pain at rest and during movement at different times after surgery, but the quality of the evidence varies and more research is needed to confirm these findings, especially for complications and long-term effects.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these regional analgesia techniques directly against each other, including their effects on pain, complications, and recovery, to provide clearer guidance for patients and healthcare providers, and to address the current limitations in the evidence, such as small sample sizes and limited data on long-term outcomes.\n**Introduction**\n### What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?\nPostoperative pain is a common problem for individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. However, these techniques can have risks and side effects.\n### What are the common regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery?\nCommon regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery include paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques aim to reduce pain by blocking nerve signals in specific areas of the body.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of different regional analgesia techniques in reducing postoperative pain and complications in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. They aimed to compare the analgesic benefits and harms of PVB, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB, and to determine which technique is most effective in managing postoperative pain.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 39 studies that involved 2348 participants. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023 in several countries including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, USA, and Thailand. Most studies used single-shot long-acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance, and in 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy. All studies performed surgery under general anaesthesia in the hospital. The review had no dedicated funding. The regional analgesia techniques included in our analysis seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications. Intervention probably reduces outcome slightly. Intervention may reduce outcome slightly. It is unclear if intervention has an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there were too few studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

The 'Results' section contains generic placeholder text instead of specific findings, and several subheadings are not phrased as questions. Additionally, the text exhibits high vocabulary complexity and noun-heavy phrasing, making it difficult for a patient audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in some areas (61.1% in the best quartile), but significantly deviates in others. Six features deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalization (P90), complex_words_dc (P90), nouns (BEYOND_P90), smog_index (BEYOND_P90), complex_words (BEYOND_P90), and long_words (BEYOND_P90). These deviations suggest that the text is more complex, uses more unfamiliar and longer words, and is more noun-heavy than typical plain language summaries, impacting overall readability."
