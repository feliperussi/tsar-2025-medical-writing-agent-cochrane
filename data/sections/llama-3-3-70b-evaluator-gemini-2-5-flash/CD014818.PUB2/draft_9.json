  "draft": "Which type of pain-blocking injection is best after breast cancer surgery? We looked at four types of regional pain blocks: \n- Paravertebral block: an injection near the spine.\n- Erector spinae plane block: an injection near the back muscles.\n- Pectoral nerve block: an injection near the chest nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block: an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.\n\nKey messages:\n- All four of these pain-blocking injections provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects. However, because the studies included small numbers of people, we cannot be certain about these results.\n- No harmful effects of these pain-blocking injections were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is pain after breast cancer surgery and how is it treated? \nPostoperative pain (pain after surgery) is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional pain blocks (injections that block pain in a specific area of the body) are often used to manage postoperative pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out which of these four pain blocks works best to reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for any risks or side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review? \nWe searched for studies comparing regional pain blocks for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 39 studies that included a total of 2348 women. Our review of these studies showed that all four regional pain block techniques provided similar levels of pain relief.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people, so we cannot be certain about the results. The studies also used different types of participants and delivered the injections in different ways, which makes the findings harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this review? \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
