  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\nWe looked at four types of 'regional pain blocks' (injections to numb a specific area): \n- Paravertebral block: an injection near the spine.\n- Erector spinae plane block: an injection near the back muscles.\n- Pectoral nerve block: an injection near the chest nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block: an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.\n\nKey messages:\n- These four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects. However, because the studies included small numbers of people, we cannot be certain about these results.\n- No harmful effects of these pain-blocking injections were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is pain after breast cancer surgery and how is it treated?\nPostoperative pain (pain after surgery) is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional pain blocks (injections that block pain in a specific area of the body) are often used to manage postoperative pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which of these four pain blocks works best to reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for any risks or side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional pain blocks for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review found that all four regional pain block techniques provided similar levels of pain relief. No single technique stood out as being clearly better or safer than the others. However, because the studies were small, we cannot be certain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people, so we cannot be certain about the results. The studies also used different types of participants and delivered the injections in different ways, which makes the findings harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores. However, it's not approved because a few issues with precision and missing context could mislead a reader. Addressing these key points will make the summary much clearer and more helpful.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the main title more specific.**\n   - **The issue:** The current title, \"What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\", is too broad. It implies a review of all possible methods (e.g., pills, IV medication), but the research only covers four specific types of injections.\n   - **Your text:** \"What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Which type of pain-blocking injection is best after breast cancer surgery?\"\n\n2. **Add context to the main findings.**\n   - **The issue:** The 'What did we find?' section summarizes the outcome but omits the scale of the research. Including the number of studies and participants helps readers understand the basis for the conclusions and why the evidence has limitations.\n   - **Your text:** \"Our review found that all four regional pain block techniques provided similar levels of pain relief.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found 39 studies that included a total of 2348 women. Our review of these studies showed that all four regional pain block techniques provided similar levels of pain relief.\"\n\n3. **Strengthen the phrasing of the first key message.**\n   - **The issue:** The phrase \"seem to provide\" is slightly hesitant. You can state the finding more directly and then immediately follow with the important caveat about the evidence quality, which you already do well.\n   - **Your text:** \"These four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"All four of these pain-blocking injections provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects. However, because the studies included small numbers of people, we cannot be certain about these results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best (72.2%) or median (27.8%) quartiles for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. This indicates the text is already very clear and easy to read from a technical standpoint. The feedback focuses on improving content precision and completeness rather than linguistic style."
