  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We looked at four types of regional pain blocks: paravertebral block (injecting medication near the spine), erector spinae plane block (near back muscles), pectoral nerve block (near chest nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (near muscles in the side of the body). Our review suggests these methods are comparable for reducing pain and complications after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions.\n- No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?\nPostoperative pain is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain.\n\n### What are the different types of regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?\nThere are several types of regional analgesia techniques that can be used to manage postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, including paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body to block pain signals to the brain.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which regional analgesia techniques are most effective in reducing postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, and whether these techniques have any risks or side effects.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found that all four regional pain block techniques seemed to work about as well as each other for reducing pain after surgery. No harmful effects were reported in the studies we looked at. Our findings are based on 39 studies involving 2348 women who had breast cancer surgery.\n\n**Limitations**\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because:\n- the studies included only a small number of people;\n- there were not enough studies to be certain about the results;\n- the studies used different methods and included different types of people.\n\n**Currency**\n### How up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that meets all critical requirements for accuracy and structure. The linguistic metrics are also excellent. I have three suggestions to make the summary even clearer and more accessible for patients.\n\n**1. Make the list of pain blocks in the Key Messages easier to read.**\n\nThe first key message contains a lot of technical information in one long sentence. Breaking it up with a bulleted list will help readers understand the main point more quickly.\n\n- **Original Text:** 'We looked at four types of regional pain blocks: paravertebral block (injecting medication near the spine), erector spinae plane block (near back muscles), pectoral nerve block (near chest nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (near muscles in the side of the body).'\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We looked at four types of 'regional pain blocks' (injections to numb a specific area):\n  - **Paravertebral block:** an injection near the spine.\n  - **Erector spinae plane block:** an injection near the back muscles.\n  - **Pectoral nerve block:** an injection near the chest nerves.\n  - **Serratus anterior plane block:** an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.'\n\n**2. Streamline the Introduction for better flow.**\n\nThe first two sections of the introduction are very similar and could be combined. This would make the opening feel less repetitive and get to the point faster.\n\n- **Original Structure:** The text is split under two headings: 'What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?' and 'What are the different types of regional analgesia techniques...?'\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine these under a single heading like '**Pain after breast cancer surgery and how it is treated**'. You can then explain what postoperative pain is and immediately introduce the regional analgesia techniques as a solution in one flowing section.\n\n**3. Use more precise language in the Results section.**\n\nThe main finding could be stated more clearly. The current phrasing is a little vague and colloquial.\n\n- **Original Text:** 'We found that all four regional pain block techniques seemed to work about as well as each other for reducing pain after surgery.'\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We found that all four regional pain block techniques were comparable for reducing pain after surgery. This means they provided similar levels of pain relief.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour draft has a high noun count (165, which is in the top 10% of our corpus). My suggestions to use more direct phrasing (like in the Results section) and streamline the introduction will help address this by replacing noun-heavy phrases with more active verbs, making the text more engaging for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are very positive, with the draft highly conforming to typical PLS patterns. 78% of the metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 11.2) are excellent. The only notable deviation is a high noun count (165.0), which places it in the 90th percentile, suggesting the text could be made more direct and verb-driven in a few places."
