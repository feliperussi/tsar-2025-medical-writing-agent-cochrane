  "key_messages": [
    "Regional analgesia techniques (methods to numb parts of the body to stop pain) such as paravertebral block (PVB, a type of numbing injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, a type of numbing injection in the back muscles), pectoral nerve block (PEC, a type of numbing injection near the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, a type of numbing injection near the side muscles) seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain (pain after surgery) and rates of complications (unwanted effects) after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to confirm this for all types of pain and complications.",
    "The review found that these techniques may have similar effectiveness for reducing pain at rest and during movement at different times after surgery, but the quality of the evidence varies and more research is needed to confirm these findings, especially for complications and long-term effects.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing these regional analgesia techniques directly against each other, including their effects on pain, complications, and recovery, to provide clearer guidance for patients and healthcare providers, and to address the current limitations in the evidence, such as small sample sizes and limited data on long-term outcomes."

      "subheading": "What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?",
      "content": "Postoperative pain is a common problem for individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. However, these techniques can have risks and side effects."

      "subheading": "What are the common regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery?",
      "content": "Common regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery include paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques aim to reduce pain by blocking nerve signals in specific areas of the body."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of different regional analgesia techniques in reducing postoperative pain and complications in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. They aimed to compare the analgesic benefits and harms of PVB, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB, and to determine which technique is most effective in managing postoperative pain."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 39 studies that involved 2348 participants. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023 in several countries including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, USA, and Thailand. Most studies used single-shot long-acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance, and in 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy. All studies performed surgery under general anaesthesia in the hospital. The review had no dedicated funding. The regional analgesia techniques included in our analysis seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications. Intervention probably reduces outcome slightly. Intervention may reduce outcome slightly. It is unclear if intervention has an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there were too few studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.",
