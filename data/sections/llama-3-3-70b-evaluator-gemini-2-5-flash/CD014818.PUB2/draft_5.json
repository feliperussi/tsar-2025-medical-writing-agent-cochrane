  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery? \nWe looked at four types of 'regional pain blocks' (injections to numb a specific area): \n- Paravertebral block: an injection near the spine.\n- Erector spinae plane block: an injection near the back muscles.\n- Pectoral nerve block: an injection near the chest nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block: an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.\nOur review suggests these methods are comparable for reducing pain and complications after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions.\nNo harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\nFuture research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is pain after breast cancer surgery and how is it treated?\nPostoperative pain is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. These techniques can help reduce pain and discomfort, but they can also have risks and side effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which of these four pain blocks works best to reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for any risks or side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that all four regional pain block techniques were comparable for reducing pain after surgery. This means they provided similar levels of pain relief. No harmful effects were reported in the studies we looked at. Our findings are based on 39 studies involving 2348 women who had breast cancer surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because the studies included only a small number of people, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different methods and included different types of people.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that meets all critical requirements for accuracy, completeness, and length. The readability scores are excellent. However, I am recommending a few revisions to further improve clarity for a patient audience before final approval. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarify the main finding in the key messages.** The current wording is a bit vague and indirect for a summary statement.\n    *   **The sentence:** \"Our review suggests these methods are comparable for reducing pain and complications after breast cancer surgery...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** For a patient, \"comparable\" isn't immediately clear. The key message should be unambiguous on its own.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found that these four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the long sentence explaining the limitations.** Even though the average sentence length is good, this specific sentence is an outlier that combines too many ideas.\n    *   **The sentence:** \"We have less confidence in the evidence because the studies included only a small number of people, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different methods and included different types of people.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 36-word sentence lists three distinct limitations, which can be difficult for a reader to process at once.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people, so we cannot be certain about the results. They also used different methods, which makes the findings harder to compare.\"\n\n3. **Add a 'Key Messages' subheading to better structure the introduction.** The opening section contains the most important takeaways, but they are mixed with definitions.\n    *   **The section:** The entire first block of text before the first formal subheading.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Without a clear heading, the main conclusions don't stand out as much as they should.\n    *   **Suggested structure:** We recommend adding a bolded 'Key messages' subheading after the list of definitions to clearly separate the main findings for readers who are scanning the document.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. All 18 metrics, including readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8.8) and sentence length (16 words/sentence), are within the typical ranges. This indicates a very strong draft from a statistical perspective, with no significant deviations."
