  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods (like paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block) for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Regional analgesia techniques block pain in a specific area of the body. These include paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). Our review suggests these methods are comparable for reducing pain and complications after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions.\n- No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms, and to address the current limitations in the evidence, such as small sample sizes and limited data availability.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?\nPostoperative pain is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. These techniques can help reduce pain and discomfort, but they can also have risks and side effects.\n\n### What are the different types of regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?\nThere are several types of regional analgesia techniques that can be used to manage postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, including paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body to block pain signals to the brain.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which regional analgesia techniques are most effective in reducing postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, and whether these techniques have any risks or side effects. They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of different techniques, such as PVB, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB, in reducing postoperative pain and improving quality of life for people who have had breast cancer surgery.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 39 studies that involved 2348 participants. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023 in several countries including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, USA, and Thailand. Most studies used single-shot long-acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance, and in 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy. All studies performed surgery under general anaesthesia in the hospital. The review did not provide information on the duration of the studies. This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. The population characteristics were not fully described, but all participants were women undergoing breast cancer surgery. The types of interventions and comparisons included paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). Overall, the regional analgesia techniques included in our analysis seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications. For example, at two hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block (PEC) was slightly more effective than paravertebral block (PVB) in reducing pain at rest, but this difference was very small and may not be important for patients. Other techniques like erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) showed similar effectiveness to PVB for pain at rest and during movement at various time points. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n\n**Limitations**\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, an insufficient number of studies to confirm outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\n\n**Currency**\n### How up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs significant revision to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of undefined technical terms in the key messages and overly complex vocabulary and sentence structure throughout the text, which makes it difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define technical terms immediately in the Key Messages.** The first key message lists four complex medical procedures without explaining what they are. This can intimidate readers and cause them to disengage before they even start.\n   - **Problem:** \"These include paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Integrate simple definitions so readers understand the terms from the outset. For example: \"Our review looked at four types of regional pain blocks: paravertebral block (injecting medication near the spine), erector spinae plane block (near back muscles), pectoral nerve block (near chest nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (near muscles in the side of the body).\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and noun-heavy sentences.** Several sentences are dense with abstract nouns and technical language, making them hard to follow. This is especially true in the Limitations section.\n   - **Problem:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, an insufficient number of studies to confirm outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this using simpler, more direct language and break it into a list. For example: \"We have less confidence in the evidence because: \n- the studies included only a small number of people;\n- there were not enough studies to be certain about the results;\n- the studies used different methods and included different types of people.\"\n\n3. **Streamline the Results section to improve focus.** The main results paragraph begins with a long, dense block of text listing study characteristics. This buries the key findings and makes the section difficult to read.\n   - **Problem:** The paragraph starting \"We found 39 studies that involved 2348 participants...\" continues for 10 lines with details about countries, anaesthetics, funding, and population before stating the main finding.\n   - **Suggestion:** Restructure the paragraph to present the most important information first. Start with the main finding, then provide a brief summary of the study context. For example: \"We found that all four regional pain block techniques seemed to work about as well as each other for reducing pain after surgery. No harmful effects were reported in the studies we looked at. Our findings are based on 39 studies involving 2348 women who had breast cancer surgery.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your own evaluation results confirm these issues. The draft has very high scores for `complex_words` (174), `long_words` (229), and `nouns` (252), all of which are well beyond the typical range for a Plain Language Summary. The SMOG index of 16.2 indicates a reading level that is too high for a general audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity in sentence structure and use of voice, with 72% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, the summary deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' category: `nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, and `long_words`. This indicates that the text uses a high number of long, technical, and uncommon words, resulting in a SMOG reading grade of 16.2, which is much higher than the typical PLS range of 10-15 and makes the text difficult for a lay audience to comprehend."
