  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods after breast cancer surgery, and how do they compare in reducing pain and complications?\n\nKey Messages\n- Regional analgesia techniques, such as paravertebral block (a type of numbing injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (a type of numbing injection in the back muscles), pectoral nerve block (a type of numbing injection near the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (a type of numbing injection near the side muscles), seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain (pain after surgery) and rates of complications (unwanted effects) after breast cancer surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to confirm this for all types of pain and complications.\n- These techniques may have similar effectiveness for reducing pain at rest and during movement at different times after surgery. But the quality of the evidence varies, and more research is needed to confirm these findings, especially for complications and long-term effects.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these regional analgesia techniques directly against each other, including their effects on pain, complications, and recovery. This will provide clearer guidance for patients and healthcare providers and address the current limitations in the evidence, such as small sample sizes and limited data on long-term outcomes.\n\nWhat is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?\nPostoperative pain is a common problem for individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. However, these techniques can have risks and side effects.\n\nWhat are the common regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery?\nCommon regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery include paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques aim to reduce pain by blocking nerve signals in specific areas of the body.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of different regional analgesia techniques in reducing postoperative pain and complications in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. They aimed to compare the analgesic benefits and harms of PVB, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB and determine which technique is most effective in managing postoperative pain.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 39 studies that involved 2348 participants. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023 in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, USA, and Thailand. Most studies used single-shot long-acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance, and in 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy. All studies performed surgery under general anaesthesia in the hospital. The review had no dedicated funding. The regional analgesia techniques included in our analysis seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and there were too few studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the best pain relief methods after breast cancer surgery. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask your healthcare provider.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid start. The summary is factually accurate, well-structured, and meets all the critical requirements. However, the language is often too complex for a general audience, and could make it difficult for patients to understand the key findings. The main goal of the revision should be to simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\\n\\n1. **Simplify the first Key Message.** The first bullet point is 66 words long and packed with technical terms and definitions. This makes it very difficult to understand the main takeaway. Readers may get lost before they finish the sentence.\\n   - **Problematic text:** \\\"Regional analgesia techniques, such as paravertebral block (a type of numbing injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (a type of numbing injection in the back muscles), pectoral nerve block (a type of numbing injection near the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (a type of numbing injection near the side muscles), seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain (pain after surgery) and rates of complications (unwanted effects) after breast cancer surgery.\\\"\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"Different methods for numbing parts of the body after breast cancer surgery seem to work equally well for reducing pain and side effects. These methods include injections near the spine, back, chest, or side ... However, we need more evidence to be certain.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Replace technical terms with simpler, everyday language.** The summary contains medical jargon that may not be familiar to all readers. Explaining these terms in plain language will make the text more accessible.\\n   - **Problematic text:** \\\"Most studies used single-shot long-acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance, and in 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy.\\\"\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"In most studies, the pain relief was given as a single injection, which doctors guided using an ultrasound machine. Most of the women in these studies had a specific type of surgery called a modified radical mastectomy.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Make sentences more direct by using simpler words.** Some sentences are noun-heavy and use formal language, which can make them dense and hard to read. Using more common words and direct verbs will improve clarity.\\n   - **Problematic text:** \\\"Common regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery include paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).\\\"\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"To manage pain after breast cancer surgery, doctors often use numbing injections (called regional analgesia). Common types include the paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).\\\"\\n\\nBy simplifying the language in these key areas, you will make the summary much clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation results show good conformity with some PLS patterns, particularly sentence length (words_per_sentence: P25) and use of active voice (active_voice: P75). However, the summary deviates significantly from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for complex words (complex_words: P90), long words (long_words: P90), and noun count (nouns: P90) are all high. Most notably, the SMOG index (smog_index: BEYOND_P90) indicates the text's readability is much more difficult than a typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify technical terms and complex vocabulary."
