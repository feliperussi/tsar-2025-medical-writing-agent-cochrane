  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\nWe looked at four types of 'regional pain blocks' (injections to numb a specific area): \n- Paravertebral block: an injection near the spine.\n- Erector spinae plane block: an injection near the back muscles.\n- Pectoral nerve block: an injection near the chest nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block: an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that these four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is pain after breast cancer surgery and how is it treated?\nPostoperative pain (pain after surgery) is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques (injections that block pain in a specific area of the body) are often used to manage postoperative pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which of these four pain blocks works best to reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for any risks or side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review found that all four regional pain block techniques provided similar levels of pain relief. No single technique stood out as being clearly better or safer than the others. However, because the studies were small, we cannot be certain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people, so we cannot be certain about the results. They also used different methods, which makes the findings harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, concise, and factually accurate. It passes all critical checks. The feedback below focuses on a few key areas to make the language even more consistent and clear for a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use consistent terminology for the interventions.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary introduces the simple term 'regional pain blocks' but then frequently reverts to the more technical term \"regional analgesia techniques\" in later sections.\n   - **Quote:** \"No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported...\" and \"Regional analgesia techniques (injections that block pain in a specific area of the body) are often used...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** For better readability, stick with the simpler term throughout. After defining 'regional pain blocks' once at the beginning, use that term or \"pain-blocking injections\" consistently. For example, rewrite the sentence to: \"No harmful effects of these pain-blocking injections were reported in the studies...\"\n\n2. **Make the main key message more specific.**\n   - **The issue:** The first key message says the evidence isn't strong enough, but doesn't say why. Linking the finding to the reason within the key message itself makes it more impactful.\n   - **Quote:** \"We found that these four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add the primary reason for the uncertainty directly into the key message. For example: \"These four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects. However, because the studies included small numbers of people, we cannot be certain about these results.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the description of limitations.**\n   - **The issue:** The explanation for why the evidence is limited is a bit vague. The term \"different methods\" could be more descriptive for a reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"They also used different methods, which makes the findings harder to compare.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Briefly explain what was different in simple terms. Consider this rewrite based on the source material: \"The studies also used different types of participants and delivered the injections in different ways, which makes the findings harder to compare.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent and show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 72% of the metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and simplicity, including words per sentence (16.15), Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (8.4), and passive voice (6 instances). The feedback provided focuses on minor refinements to consistency and clarity that statistical analysis alone does not capture."
