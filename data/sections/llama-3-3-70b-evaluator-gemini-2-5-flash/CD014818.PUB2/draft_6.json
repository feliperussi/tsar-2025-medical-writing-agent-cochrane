  "draft": "What are the best pain relief methods for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery?\nWe looked at four types of 'regional pain blocks' (injections to numb a specific area): \n- Paravertebral block: an injection near the spine.\n- Erector spinae plane block: an injection near the back muscles.\n- Pectoral nerve block: an injection near the chest nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block: an injection near the muscles in the side of the body.\n\n**Key messages:**\n- We found that these four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects.\n- No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, which is a positive finding, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other in larger, well-designed studies to give better estimates of their benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is pain after breast cancer surgery and how is it treated?\nPostoperative pain (pain after surgery) is a common problem for people who have had breast cancer surgery. It can be severe and affect a person's quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques (methods to block pain in a specific area of the body), which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. These techniques can help reduce pain and discomfort, but they can also have risks and side effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which of these four pain blocks works best to reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for any risks or side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that all four regional pain block techniques were comparable for reducing pain after surgery. This means they provided similar levels of pain relief. No harmful effects were reported in the studies we looked at. Our findings are based on 39 studies involving 2348 women who had breast cancer surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies included only a small number of people, so we cannot be certain about the results. They also used different methods, which makes the findings harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and meets most style guidelines, but it is not approved due to a critical factual omission that overstates the certainty of the review's findings. The key messages must be updated to reflect the low certainty of the evidence. I have outlined this and two other improvements for clarity below.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Add the critical caveat about evidence certainty to the key messages.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We found that these four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This statement is factually incomplete. It omits the crucial conclusion from the original review that \"the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions.\" Leaving this out gives the reader a false sense of confidence in the findings.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that these four pain-blocking injections seem to provide similar levels of pain relief and have similar risks of side effects, **but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.**\"\n\n**2. Make the main findings in the 'What did we find?' section more specific.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We found that all four regional pain block techniques were comparable for reducing pain after surgery. This means they provided similar levels of pain relief.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is vague and just repeats the key message. It should briefly explain *why* they are considered comparable (i.e., no clear winner) and reinforce the uncertainty mentioned in the limitations.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our review found that all four regional pain block techniques provided similar levels of pain relief. No single technique stood out as being clearly better or safer than the others. However, because the studies were small, we cannot be certain about these results.\"\n\n**3. Remove redundant phrasing in the introduction.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Regional analgesia techniques (methods to block pain in a specific area of the body), which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The sentence defines the term in parentheses and then immediately repeats the same information in the main clause. This is wordy and can be streamlined.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Regional analgesia techniques (injections that block pain in a specific area of the body) are often used to manage postoperative pain.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical or best quartile ranges for a Plain Language Summary. Readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 8.5) and structural metrics (e.g., words per sentence at 16) are excellent, indicating the text is mechanically easy to read. However, these metrics do not capture the critical content issue—the omission of the low certainty of the evidence—which is the primary reason for the 'NOT_APPROVED' grade."
