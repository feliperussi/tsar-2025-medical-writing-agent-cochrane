  "draft": "Is using a bronchoscopy (a procedure that looks inside the lungs) helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\n- We found that using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment for people with cystic fibrosis may make little or no difference in lung function or other important outcomes compared to standard care. It may also lead to more hospitalizations, although the harmful effects from the procedure itself are generally mild.\n- The current evidence is limited by the small number of studies and their focus on specific age groups, such as preschool children, with no evidence available for adults. This highlights the need for more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of bronchoscopy-guided therapy in different populations.\n- Future research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy, exploring its potential benefits and harms in various age groups, including adults, and addressing the gaps in current evidence to inform clinical practice and improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. CF affects the cells that produce mucus (a thick, protective fluid), sweat, and digestive juices, causing these fluids to become thick and sticky. This thickness clogs tubes, ducts, and passageways, particularly in the lungs and pancreas. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Diagnosing and treating these infections early is crucial to manage the disease effectively.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?\nThe main goal of treating lung infections in people with CF is to prevent further damage to the lungs. Common treatments include antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria), which can be given orally (by mouth), intravenously (through a vein), or through inhalation (breathing in). However, diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially when they are not producing sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucus). In such cases, doctors rely on samples from the back of the throat (throat swabs) to help identify the bacteria causing the infection. Bronchoscopy, a procedure that involves inserting a tube with a camera into the lungs to collect samples, can provide more accurate diagnoses but is invasive (involves entering the body) and carries risks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to determine whether this approach improves outcomes, such as lung function, reduces the number of lung infections, or enhances quality of life compared to standard care, which relies on throat swabs and symptoms to decide on treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to other approaches, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate its effectiveness in managing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to standard treatment based on clinical features and throat swabs. Using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in lung health as seen on CT scans. It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

The main issues are overly complex sentences and the use of formal, noun-heavy language that makes the text dense and difficult to read.

Breaking them into shorter, more direct sentences will improve comprehension.\\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \\\"Future research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy, exploring its potential benefits and harms in various age groups, including adults, and addressing the gaps in current evidence to inform clinical practice and improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis.\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 46 words, this sentence is very long and uses formal, abstract language (e.g., 'prioritize studying', 'inform clinical practice').\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this treatment. Future studies should look at the benefits and harms in different age groups, including adults. This will help improve care for people with cystic fibrosis.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Replace complex descriptions with simpler, more active language.** The methods section, in particular, uses technical phrasing that could be simplified.\\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \\\"We searched for studies comparing bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to other approaches, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate its effectiveness in managing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This 34-word sentence contains several complex ideas and noun-heavy phrases like 'effectiveness in managing'.\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"We looked for studies that compared using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment with other methods. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Use consistent, simple terminology.** The text uses several different terms for the standard procedure, which could confuse readers.\\n   - **Problematic terms:** The draft alternates between \\\"throat swabs,\\\" \\\"oropharyngeal specimens,\\\" and \\\"oropharyngeal cultures.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Switching between technical and plain terms for the same thing can make readers wonder if they are different procedures.\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Choose the simplest term, \\\"throat swabs,\\\" and use it consistently throughout the summary.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While the draft is within the word limit and has acceptable sentence length and passive voice scores, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including 'complex_words', 'long_words', 'nouns', and 'nominalization', are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates the text uses an unusually high number of long, complex, and abstract words compared to a typical PLS, making it denser and more difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
