  "draft": "Is using a bronchoscopy helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nWe looked at whether using a bronchoscopy (a procedure that looks inside the lungs using a flexible tube with a camera) to guide antibiotic treatment makes a difference for people with cystic fibrosis. \n- We found that it may make little or no difference in lung function or other important outcomes compared to standard care. \n- It may also lead to more hospitalizations, but the harmful effects from the procedure itself are generally mild.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?\n- The main goal of treating lung infections in people with CF is to prevent further damage to the lungs. \n- Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation. \n- Diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially when they are not producing sputum. \n- In such cases, doctors rely on throat swabs to help identify the bacteria causing the infection.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis. \n- We aimed to determine whether this approach improves outcomes, such as lung function, reduces the number of lung infections, or enhances quality of life compared to standard care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment with other methods. \n- We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. \n- The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antibiotic treatment to standard treatment based on symptoms and throat swabs. \n- Using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in lung health as seen on CT scans. \n- It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. \n- There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies. \n- No evidence is available for adults, highlighting the need for more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of bronchoscopy-guided therapy in different populations.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. \n- The evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this treatment. \n- Future studies should look at the benefits and harms in different age groups, including adults. \n- This will help improve care for people with cystic fibrosis.",
