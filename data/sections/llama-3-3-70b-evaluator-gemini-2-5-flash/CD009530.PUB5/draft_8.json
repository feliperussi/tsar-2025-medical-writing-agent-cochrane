  "draft": "Is using a bronchoscopy helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nWe looked at whether using a bronchoscopy - a procedure that looks inside the lungs using a flexible tube with a camera - to guide antibiotic treatment makes a difference for people with cystic fibrosis. \n- We treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis to prevent further lung damage.\n- We found that using a bronchoscopy to guide treatment may make little or no difference to lung function, lung health on CT scans, or quality of life compared to standard care.\n- It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but the harmful effects from the procedure itself are generally mild.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?\n- Doctors treat lung infections in people with CF to prevent further lung damage. \n- Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation. \n- Diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially in people who are not coughing up phlegm (sputum). \n- In such cases, doctors rely on throat swabs to help identify the bacteria causing the infection.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment improves lung function, reduces lung infections, or improves quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis compared to standard care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing bronchoscopy-guided antibiotic treatment to other methods. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. \n- The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antibiotic treatment to standard treatment based on symptoms and throat swabs. \n- Using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in lung health as seen on CT scans. \n- It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. \n- There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies. \n- No evidence is available for adults, highlighting the need for more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of bronchoscopy-guided therapy in different populations.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. \n- The evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this treatment. \n- Future studies should look at the benefits and harms in different age groups, including adults. \n- This will help improve care for people with cystic fibrosis.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. However, a few targeted revisions will make it even easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of complex nouns.** Some sentences are noun-heavy, which can make them feel abstract and harder to read. This is sometimes called 'nominalization'.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"incomplete reporting of outcomes\" are abstract. It's clearer to state who did (or didn't do) the action.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and the researchers did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the definition of bronchoscopy.** The definition is currently embedded in the middle of a long sentence, which can be difficult to follow.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We looked at whether using a bronchoscopy - a procedure that looks inside the lungs using a flexible tube with a camera - to guide antibiotic treatment makes a difference for people with cystic fibrosis.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers have to process the main point of the sentence while also learning a new technical term and its definition.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"A bronchoscopy is a procedure where a doctor uses a flexible tube with a camera to look inside the lungs. In this review, we wanted to know if using information from a bronchoscopy to choose antibiotics helps people with cystic fibrosis.\"\n\n3. **Remove repeated information for better flow.** The summary states the goal of treatment in both the key messages and the main text, which is unnecessary.\n   - **Original text (under 'What are the common treatments...'):** \"- Doctors treat lung infections in people with CF to prevent further lung damage. - Common treatments include antibiotics...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The first sentence repeats a point already made in the key messages (\"We treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis to prevent further lung damage.\"). Removing it makes the text more concise.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Simply delete the first sentence and start the paragraph with: \"Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation.\"\n\nThese changes will help make an already good summary even more accessible to your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. The text has excellent sentence length, readability scores, and use of active voice. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate from typical patterns: 'nominalization' (P90), 'nouns' (P90), and 'complex_words_dc' (P90). This suggests the text relies more heavily on complex noun phrases and less common words than a typical PLS, which supports the editorial recommendation to replace abstract nouns with more direct verb-based phrasing."
