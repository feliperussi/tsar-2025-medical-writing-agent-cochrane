  "draft": "Is using a bronchoscopy helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nWe looked at whether using a bronchoscopy (a procedure that looks inside the lungs using a flexible tube with a camera) to guide antibiotic treatment makes a difference for people with cystic fibrosis. \n- We treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis to prevent further lung damage.\n- We found that using a bronchoscopy to guide treatment may make little or no difference to lung function, lung health on CT scans, or quality of life compared to standard care.\n- It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but the harmful effects from the procedure itself are generally mild.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?\n- Doctors treat lung infections in people with CF to prevent further lung damage. \n- Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation. \n- Diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially when they are not producing sputum. \n- In such cases, doctors rely on throat swabs to help identify the bacteria causing the infection.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment improves lung function, reduces lung infections, or improves quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis compared to standard care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment with other methods. \n- We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. \n- The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antibiotic treatment to standard treatment based on symptoms and throat swabs. \n- Using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in lung health as seen on CT scans. \n- It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. \n- There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies. \n- No evidence is available for adults, highlighting the need for more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of bronchoscopy-guided therapy in different populations.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. \n- The evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term effects of this treatment. \n- Future studies should look at the benefits and harms in different age groups, including adults. \n- This will help improve care for people with cystic fibrosis.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. The readability scores are excellent. However, to make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on three key areas before approval:\n\n1. **Replace clinical terms with simpler, everyday language.** Some phrases, while technically correct, may be unfamiliar to a general audience. This will make the text more accessible.\n   - **Original:** \"...especially when they are not producing sputum.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Producing sputum\" is clinical jargon.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...especially in people who are not coughing up phlegm (sputum).\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** The draft sometimes turns actions into abstract nouns, which can make sentences feel dense and bureaucratic. Using active verbs makes the writing more direct and easier to follow.\n   - **Original:** \"...incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a very abstract and noun-heavy phrase. It's unclear what it means for the reader.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...they did not always measure the same health outcomes, which made it difficult to compare their results directly.\"\n\n3. **Streamline the methods and conclusions for conciseness.** Some sections can be combined or rephrased to be more direct and avoid repetition.\n   - **Original:** \"We searched for studies that compare using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment with other methods. - We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Problem:** The bullet point isn't necessary for two short, related sentences.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We searched for studies comparing antibiotic treatment guided by bronchoscopy against treatment guided by other methods. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows high conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in readability and sentence length, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary choice, with a high number of nouns (161.0), nominalizations (26.0), and Dale-Chall complex words (217.0), all falling in the P90 range. This suggests that while the sentence structure is simple, the language could be made more direct and less abstract by replacing clinical nouns with simpler words and action verbs."
