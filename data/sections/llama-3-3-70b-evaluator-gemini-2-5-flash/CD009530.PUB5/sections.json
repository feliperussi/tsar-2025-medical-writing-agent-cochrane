  "key_messages": [
    "Using a bronchoscopy (a procedure that looks inside the lungs using a flexible tube with a camera) to guide antimicrobial therapy for people with cystic fibrosis may make little or no difference in lung function or other important outcomes compared to standard care, and it may lead to more hospitalizations, although harmful effects from the procedure itself, such as transient worsening of cough, were generally mild.",
    "The current evidence is limited by the small number of studies and their focus on specific age groups, such as preschool children, with no evidence available for adults, highlighting the need for more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of bronchoscopy-guided therapy in different populations.",
    "Future research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy, exploring its potential benefits and harms in various age groups, including adults, and addressing the gaps in current evidence to inform clinical practice and improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis."

      "subheading": "What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. CF affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat, and digestive juices, causing these fluids to become thick and sticky. This thickness clogs tubes, ducts, and passageways, particularly in the lungs and pancreas. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be lifeâ€‘threatening if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment of these infections are crucial to manage the disease effectively."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?",
      "content": "The main goal of treating lung infections in people with CF is to prevent further damage to the lungs. Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation. However, diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially when they are not producing sputum. In such cases, doctors rely on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens, which may not always accurately identify the bacteria causing the infection. Bronchoscopy, a procedure that involves inserting a tube with a camera into the lungs to collect samples, can provide more accurate diagnoses but is invasive and carries risks."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using bronchoscopy to guide antimicrobial therapy in people with cystic fibrosis. They wanted to determine whether this approach improves outcomes, such as lung function, reduces the frequency of lung infections, and enhances quality of life compared to standard care, which relies on oropharyngeal cultures and clinical symptoms to guide treatment decisions."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. Most studies lasted for around 5 years. The funding sources of the studies were not specified. The population characteristics included infants under six months of age and children aged between five and 18 years. The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in chest scores assessed by computed tomography scan. It may lead to more hospitalisations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies.",
