  "draft": "Is using a bronchoscopy (a procedure that looks inside the lungs) helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment for people with cystic fibrosis may make little or no difference in lung function or other important outcomes compared to standard care. It may also lead to more hospitalizations, although the harmful effects from the procedure itself are generally mild.\n- The current evidence is limited by the small number of studies and their focus on specific age groups, such as preschool children, with no evidence available for adults. This highlights the need for more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of bronchoscopy-guided therapy in different populations.\n- Future research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy, exploring its potential benefits and harms in various age groups, including adults, and addressing the gaps in current evidence to inform clinical practice and improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis.\n\n**What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?**\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. CF affects the cells that produce mucus (a thick, protective fluid), sweat, and digestive juices, causing these fluids to become thick and sticky. This thickness clogs tubes, ducts, and passageways, particularly in the lungs and pancreas. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment of these infections are crucial to manage the disease effectively.\n\n**What are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?**\nThe main goal of treating lung infections in people with CF is to prevent further damage to the lungs. Common treatments include antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria), which can be given orally (by mouth), intravenously (through a vein), or through inhalation (breathing in). However, diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially when they are not producing sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucus). In such cases, doctors rely on samples from the back of the throat (throat swabs) to help identify the bacteria causing the infection. Bronchoscopy, a procedure that involves inserting a tube with a camera into the lungs to collect samples, can provide more accurate diagnoses but is invasive (involves entering the body) and carries risks.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out if using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to determine whether this approach improves outcomes, such as lung function, reduces the frequency of lung infections, and enhances quality of life compared to standard care, which relies on throat swabs and symptoms to decide on treatment.\n\n**How did we conduct this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to other approaches, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate its effectiveness in managing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to standard treatment based on clinical features and throat swabs. Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in chest scores assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan. It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest across the studies.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is the use of overly complex and technical vocabulary, which makes the text difficult to understand despite its short sentences. The feedback below focuses on simplifying key terms and rephrasing noun-heavy sentences to be more direct and active.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Repeated Technical Terms and Jargon**\n\nThe draft uses long, technical phrases repeatedly, which can be tiring and confusing for readers. After defining a term, use a simpler substitute in the rest of the text.\n\n- **Problematic Phrase:** \"Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrase is long, technical, and used multiple times. It makes sentences clunky and hard to read.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** After its first use, replace it with simpler phrases like \"this approach,\" \"using bronchoscopy to guide treatment,\" or \"bronchoscopy-directed treatment.\"\n  - For example, in the Results section, change: \"*Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy* may make little to no difference in lung function...\"\n  - To: \"*Using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment* may make little to no difference in lung function...\"\n\n**2. Replace Abstract Nouns (Nominalizations) with Active Verbs**\n\nThe text often uses nouns to describe actions, which makes it feel abstract and less direct. Using verbs instead makes the writing clearer and more engaging.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Early *diagnosis and treatment* of these infections are crucial to manage the disease effectively.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Diagnosis and treatment\" are nouns describing actions. This phrasing is less direct than using verbs.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"*Diagnosing and treating* these infections early is crucial to manage the disease effectively.\"\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"We aimed to determine whether this approach improves outcomes, such as lung function, reduces the *frequency* of lung infections, and enhances quality of life...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and uses abstract nouns like \"frequency\" and \"enhances quality of life.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if this approach leads to better results, such as improved lung function, *fewer* lung infections, or a better quality of life.\"\n\n**3. Clarify Technical Descriptions of Medical Procedures and Findings**\n\nSome descriptions, while accurate, are still too technical for a patient audience. They can be simplified without losing their meaning.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"...probably makes little to no difference in chest scores assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"chest scores assessed by\" is jargon. Readers may not understand what a \"chest score\" is.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...probably makes little to no difference in lung health as seen on CT scans.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence-level metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (16.9) and 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade' (10.8) are in the best quartile, indicating good sentence structure, there is significant deviation in vocabulary. Five metrics related to word complexity are 'Beyond P90', including 'complex_words' (149 vs. median <84), 'long_words' (219 vs. median <122), and the 'SMOG Index' (15.3 vs. median <12.1). This suggests the text uses short sentences but fills them with unnecessarily complex and technical words, which will harm readability for a lay audience. The high number of nouns (207, 'Beyond P90') and nominalizations (25, 'P90') supports the editorial feedback to use more active verbs."
