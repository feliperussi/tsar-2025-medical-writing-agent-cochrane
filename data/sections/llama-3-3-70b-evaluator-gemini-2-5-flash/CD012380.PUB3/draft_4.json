  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease, although hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises) may improve the ability to concentrate urine (the process by which the kidneys remove waste and excess fluids from the body) in children. \nDue to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions (a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body to replace damaged or diseased ones) or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease. \nFuture research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys), and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. \nOne of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. \nThis kidney disease can cause serious problems. It can lead to proteinuria, which means too much protein is in the urine. It can also cause the kidneys to not work as well as they should (chronic kidney insufficiency). For up to 12% of people, this can lead to complete kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments include red blood cell transfusions (where healthy red blood cells are given to a person), hydroxyurea (a medicine to reduce painful episodes), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (medicines that lower blood pressure). \nThese treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. \nWe examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. \nThe studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. \nThe types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. \nUnfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were: \n- For hydroxyurea: We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine. \n- For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The key messages, in particular, are written in very long, complex sentences that make the main findings difficult to understand. The vocabulary is also more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break down long sentences in the Key Messages.** The first two paragraphs contain single sentences that are over 50 words long. This makes it very difficult for readers to grasp the main takeaways.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease, although hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises) may improve the ability to concentrate urine (the process by which the kidneys remove waste and excess fluids from the body) in children.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain. However, one medicine, hydroxyurea, may help children's kidneys to concentrate urine. This is the process the kidneys use to remove waste and excess fluids from the body.\"\n\n2. **Separate definitions from complex sentences.** You have correctly included definitions for technical terms, but embedding them in parentheses within long sentences makes them hard to read. It's better to introduce the term and define it in a separate, short sentence.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions (a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body to replace damaged or diseased ones) or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We also looked for evidence on red blood cell transfusions. This is a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body. Due to a lack of evidence, we cannot say if transfusions or combined treatments are effective for preventing kidney complications.\"\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** The text has a very high number of nouns, which can make it feel dense and academic. Rephrasing sentences to use verbs instead of noun forms will make the text more direct and easier to read.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In the future, researchers should conduct well-designed studies to assess the benefits and harms of different treatments...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your own editorial judgment is confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very high number of nouns (221, 'BEYOND_P90') and complex words (127, 'P90'), contributing to a high SMOG index (13.8, 'P90'). Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a PLS and significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical patterns for sentence structure and voice (words_per_sentence and active_voice are in the P50-P75 range). However, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics, including `smog_index`, `complex_words`, `long_words`, and `nouns`, are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates the text is much denser and uses more complex and technical vocabulary than a typical PLS, which could make it difficult for a lay audience to understand."
