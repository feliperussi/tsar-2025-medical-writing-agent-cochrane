  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease? \nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease, although hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine in children. \nDue to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease. \nFuture research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem? \nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. \nOne of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. \nThis condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria (too much protein in the urine) and chronic kidney insufficiency (the kidneys not working well), with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease (complete kidney failure).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications? \nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. \nThese treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. \nThey examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence? \nWe searched electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors find? \nWe found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. \nThe studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. \nThe types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. \nUnfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review? \nOur main findings were: \n- For hydroxyurea: We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine. \n- For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that clearly summarizes the review's conclusions. The structure is good, and all the necessary sections are included. To make it even more accessible for patients and the public, I recommend focusing on the following four areas:\\n\\n1. **Define key treatments in simple terms.**\\n   - **The issue:** The text mentions several treatments by name without explaining what they are.\\n   - **Quote:** \\\"Common treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** These treatment names will be unfamiliar to many readers. Adding a brief, simple explanation for each will greatly improve understanding.\\n   - **Suggestion:** Add the simple definitions provided in the source material. For example: \\\"Common treatments include red blood cell transfusions (where healthy red blood cells are given to a person), hydroxyurea (a medicine to reduce painful episodes), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (medicines that lower blood pressure).\\\"\\n\\n2. **Simplify the explanation of kidney disease progression.**\\n   - **The issue:** A key sentence introduces three complex medical terms at once.\\n   - **Quote:** \\\"This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria (too much protein in the urine) and chronic kidney insufficiency (the kidneys not working well), with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease (complete kidney failure).\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This long sentence is packed with new information and can be overwhelming for the reader, even with the definitions in parentheses.\\n   - **Suggestion:** Break this concept into shorter, more focused sentences. For example: \\\"This kidney disease can cause serious problems. It can lead to proteinuria, which means too much protein is in the urine. It can also cause the kidneys to not work as well as they should (chronic kidney insufficiency). For up to 12% of people, this can lead to complete kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).\\\"\\n\\n3. **Use \\\"we\\\" consistently for the review authors.**\\n   - **The issue:** The text switches between third-person (\\\"the review authors\\\") and first-person (\\\"we\\\").\\n   - **Quote:** \\\"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention...\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Using \\\"we\\\" consistently makes the summary more direct and personal, as recommended by the style guide.\\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change \\\"The review authors\\\" to \\\"We\\\" throughout the text. For example: \\\"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems...\\\"\\n\\n4. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.**\\n   - **The issue:** Some sentences rely heavily on nouns, which can make them feel dense and academic.\\n   - **Quote:** \\\"The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications...\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is less direct and harder to read than a sentence built around a strong verb.\\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrasing with more direct verbs makes the text clearer. The suggestion in the point above also fixes this: \\\"We wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems...\\\"\\n\\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the text has a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns compared to typical plain language summaries. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity in many areas, such as sentence length and active voice. However, it flags significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary. Metrics for complex words, long words, and the SMOG index are in the P90 range, and the noun count is beyond the 90th percentile. This suggests the text uses more technical and noun-heavy language than is ideal for a lay audience."
