  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood. It can cause severe pain, significant organ damage, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to serious problems, like having too much protein in the urine (proteinuria) or a long-term loss of kidney function (chronic kidney insufficiency).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include:\n- Red blood cell transfusions: a procedure where healthy red blood cells are given to a person.\n- Hydroxyurea: a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises.\n- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys.\nThese treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. Unfortunately, we found no studies on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nKey Messages:\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease, although hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine in children.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nMethods:\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease. The search included terms related to sickle cell disease, renal outcomes, and preventive or therapeutic interventions. Eligible studies were those that enrolled participants with sickle cell disease and reported on kidney-related outcomes after receiving an intervention. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies were considered. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus. Data on study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, comparator, follow-up duration, and renal outcomes were extracted using a standardized form. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to pool effect estimates.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were:\n- For hydroxyurea: One study of hydroxyurea involved children aged 9 to 18 months. We are very uncertain if it improves their overall kidney function. However, it may help their kidneys concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the number of serious problems like severe pain or hospital stays.\n- For ACEIs: We are unsure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the current state of knowledge on preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is not approved. It requires revisions to address critical issues with factual accuracy and formatting, as well as significant clarity problems.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Factual Error:** The 'Methods' section incorrectly states that 'cohort studies, and case-control studies were considered'. The review's selection criteria and included studies were limited to 'Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)' only. This must be corrected.\n2.  **Incorrect Subheadings:** Two subheadings do not follow the style guide requirement to be phrased as questions.\n    - **Original:** 'Key Messages:' and 'Methods:'\n    - **Suggested:** 'What are the key messages of this review?' and 'How did we conduct this review?'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed for Clarity:**\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Overly Technical 'Methods' Section:** The entire 'Methods' paragraph is written for a scientific audience, not patients. It is filled with jargon and passive voice, which is reflected in the high passive voice count (23 instances) and complexity scores.\n    - **Problematic Text:** 'We performed a systematic search of electronic databases... Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to pool effect estimates.'\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We searched online research databases to find all studies on this and only included studies called \"randomised controlled trials\", where people were randomly assigned to a treatment group. We then compared the results from the studies to understand the effects of the treatments on kidney health.'\n\n2.  **Simplify Complex Medical Terms:** The introduction uses several technical terms at once, which can overwhelm readers. The high number of complex and long words (both 'BEYOND_P90') confirms this.\n    - **Problematic Text:** '...kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to serious problems, like having too much protein in the urine (proteinuria) or a long-term loss of kidney function (chronic kidney insufficiency).'\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Kidney disease is a common and serious problem for people with sickle cell disease. It can cause the kidneys to leak protein into the urine and can lead to a long-term loss of kidney function.'\n\n3.  **Shorten Wordy, Noun-Heavy Sentences:** Several sentences are long and rely on nouns instead of verbs, making them hard to follow. The noun count is exceptionally high ('BEYOND_P90').\n    - **Problematic Text:** 'Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease.'\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We did not find enough evidence to say if red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments can prevent or reduce kidney problems.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like active voice and sentence length are within acceptable ranges, there are significant deviations in key areas. The text scores beyond the 90th percentile for complexity (SMOG index, complex words, long words) and noun count. Passive voice usage is also high (P90). These metrics indicate that parts of the text are likely too technical, dense, and difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
