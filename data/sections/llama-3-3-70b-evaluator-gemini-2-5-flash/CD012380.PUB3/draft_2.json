  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease, although hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine in children.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency, with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. They examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nThe review authors performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease. The search included terms related to sickle cell disease, renal outcomes, and preventive or therapeutic interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThe review authors found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. The types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe are unsure if hydroxyurea improves kidney function or reduces kidney damage in children with sickle cell disease, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of serious complications. We are also unsure if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with sickle cell disease. Additionally, we do not know if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs significant improvements in clarity and readability to be suitable for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of undefined technical jargon and overly complex sentence structures. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define technical terms or replace them with simpler language.** The text uses several medical terms without explanation, which will confuse readers.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency, with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'proteinuria', 'chronic kidney insufficiency', and 'end-stage renal disease' are undefined and will not be understood by most patients.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This condition can get worse over time, leading to too much protein in the urine (proteinuria) and the kidneys not working well (chronic kidney insufficiency). For up to 12% of people, this can lead to complete kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).\"\n\n2. **Simplify long, formal sentences.** Several sections use complex and wordy phrasing that makes the text difficult to follow.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The review authors performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is formal and uses passive-leaning language ('performed a... search'). The style guide recommends a more direct, active voice.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched electronic databases for studies that compared different treatments for preventing or reducing kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease.\"\n\n3. **Break down dense paragraphs into more digestible points.** The main results are presented in a single, long paragraph with repetitive phrasing, which makes it hard to distinguish the key findings for each treatment.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves kidney function or reduces kidney damage in children with sickle cell disease, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of serious complications. We are also unsure if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with sickle cell disease. Additionally, we do not know if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with sickle cell disease.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The repetitive structure makes it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the different conclusions for each intervention.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our main findings were:\n- **For hydroxyurea:** We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine.\n- **For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs):** We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis confirms that the draft's primary weakness is its vocabulary and sentence complexity. While many features are within the typical range for a PLS, several key metrics deviate significantly, indicating the text is too difficult for a lay audience. Specifically, the number of nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words are all in the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range. This is reflected in high readability scores like the SMOG Index and Coleman-Liau Index (both P90), which suggest a university-level reading ability is required. Addressing the complex vocabulary and sentence structure will bring these metrics closer to the typical PLS pattern and greatly improve readability."
