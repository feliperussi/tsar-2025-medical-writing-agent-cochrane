  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood. It can cause severe pain, significant organ damage, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can cause the kidneys to leak protein into the urine and can lead to a long-term loss of kidney function.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include - red blood cell transfusions: a procedure where healthy red blood cells are given to a person, \n- hydroxyurea: a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises, \n- angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys. \nThese treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. Unfortunately, we found no studies on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease, although hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine in children.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched online research databases to find all studies on this and only included studies called \"randomised controlled trials\", where people were randomly assigned to a treatment group. We then compared the results from the studies to understand the effects of the treatments on kidney health.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were - for hydroxyurea: one study of hydroxyurea involved children aged 9 to 18 months. We are very uncertain if it improves their overall kidney function. However, it may help their kidneys concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the number of serious problems like severe pain or hospital stays.\n- for ACEIs: we are unsure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the current state of knowledge on preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.",

The language is often too technical and dense, making it difficult to read. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify technical language and reduce noun-heavy sentences.** The text uses complex medical terms and dense phrasing where simpler language would be clearer.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is long and front-loaded with technical terms like \"potentially severe complications\" and \"sickle cell nephropathy.\" It's a dense way to introduce the topic.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"People with sickle cell disease can develop serious kidney problems. This is sometimes called sickle cell nephropathy.\"\n\n2. **Make definitions easier to read.** The draft defines key treatments, but the formatting makes the paragraph clunky and hard to follow.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Common treatments for sickle cell disease include - red blood cell transfusions: a procedure where healthy red blood cells are given to a person, - hydroxyurea: a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises, - angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This run-on list with embedded definitions is not easy to scan. Using proper bullet points would make the information much clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:**\n   \"Common treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications. These include:\n   - **Red blood cell transfusions:** giving a person healthy red blood cells.\n   - **Hydroxyurea:** a medicine that can reduce episodes of severe pain.\n   - **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs):** medicines that lower blood pressure and protect the kidneys.\"\n\n3. **Remove redundant phrases to make sentences more direct.** Some sentences contain wordy phrases that repeat information or add little value for the reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The purpose of the review is already clear from the heading (\"What did we want to find out?\"). The end of the sentence is redundant.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if treatments like red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs (used alone or together) could prevent or reduce kidney problems.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit and has generally good sentence structure and readability scores (most are in the best quartile). However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for nouns (BEYOND_P90), complex words (P90), and long words (P90) are all unusually high. This confirms the editorial finding that the text is denser and uses more technical language than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which could create a barrier for readers."
