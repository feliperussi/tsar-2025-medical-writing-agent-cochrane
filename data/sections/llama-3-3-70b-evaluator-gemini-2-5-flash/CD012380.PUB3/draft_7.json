  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain. However, one medicine, hydroxyurea, may help children's kidneys to concentrate urine. Hydroxyurea is a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises.\n\nWe also looked for evidence on red blood cell transfusions. Due to a lack of evidence, we cannot say if transfusions or combined treatments are effective for preventing kidney complications. Red blood cell transfusions are a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body to replace damaged or diseased ones.\n\nIn the future, researchers should conduct well-designed studies to assess the benefits and harms of different treatments, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood. It can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Proteinuria is when there is excess protein in the urine, and chronic kidney insufficiency is when the kidneys do not function properly. In up to 12% of cases, the kidneys may stop working altogether, which is called end-stage renal disease.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. The types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, we found no studies on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were: \n- For hydroxyurea: We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine.\n- For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the current state of knowledge on preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.",

For example: \\\"Common treatments include: - **Red blood cell transfusions:** a procedure where healthy red blood cells are given to a person.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Make sentences more direct by using fewer nouns.** Some sentences are dense with nouns, which can make them feel passive and clinical.\\n   - **Original:** \\\"One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy.\\\"\\n   - **Suggestion:** \\\"People with sickle cell disease often develop kidney disease, which can be severe. This is also known as sickle cell nephropathy.\\\"\\n\\nThese changes will make the summary easier for patients and their families to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has excellent sentence structure, with sentence length and readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis reveals significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary. Metrics for nouns, complex words (both general and Dale-Chall), and long words are all '...Beyond P90', and the SMOG index is at 'P90'. This indicates that while sentences are short, the word choice is overly complex and technical for a lay audience, which is the primary area needing improvement."
