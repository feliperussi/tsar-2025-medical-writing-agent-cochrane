  "key_messages": [
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if any intervention can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease (a genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications), although hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises) may improve the ability to concentrate urine (the process by which the kidneys remove waste and excess fluids from the body) in children.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions (a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body to replace damaged or diseased ones) or combined treatments for preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the benefits and potential harms of different interventions, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys), and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults."

      "subheading": "What is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe monogenic disorder caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta‐globin) genes. It can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with SCD is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency, with up to 12% of people developing end‐stage renal disease."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?",
      "content": "Common treatments for SCD include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. They examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with SCD."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease. The search included terms related to sickle cell disease, renal outcomes, and preventive or therapeutic interventions."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Study Selection",
      "content": "Eligible studies were those that enrolled participants with sickle cell disease and reported on kidney-related outcomes (e.g., albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, renal failure) after receiving an intervention. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case‑control studies were considered. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Data on study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, comparator, follow‑up duration, and renal outcomes were extracted using a standardized form. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where appropriate, meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model to pool effect estimates."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Risk of Bias Assessment",
      "content": "The risk of bias for each included study was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Domains such as randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias were assessed."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "Overall confidence in the body of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. The final rating (high, moderate, low, or very low) reflects our certainty that the reported effects are close to the true effect."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations, with one study lasting six months and another lasting several months, although the exact duration was not specified. The population characteristics varied, with one study including children aged nine to 18 months and another including adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The studies took place in different settings, although the exact locations were not specified. The types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effectiveness of Interventions for Sickle Cell Disease",
      "content": "We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves kidney function or reduces kidney damage in children with sickle cell disease, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of serious complications. We are also unsure if a type of medication called ACE inhibitors has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with sickle cell disease. Additionally, we do not know if ACE inhibitors have any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with sickle cell disease."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.",
