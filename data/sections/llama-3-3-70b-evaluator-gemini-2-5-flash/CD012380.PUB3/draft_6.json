  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease (a genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications). We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain. However, one medicine, hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises), may help children's kidneys to concentrate urine (the process by which the kidneys remove waste and excess fluids from the body).\n\nWe also looked for evidence on red blood cell transfusions (a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body to replace damaged or diseased ones). Due to a lack of evidence, we cannot say if transfusions or combined treatments are effective for preventing kidney complications.\n\nIn the future, researchers should conduct well-designed studies to assess the benefits and harms of different treatments, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys), and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy (a condition where the kidneys are damaged due to sickle cell disease). This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and chronic kidney insufficiency (reduced kidney function), with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease (a condition where the kidneys are no longer able to function properly).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. The types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo (a dummy treatment), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were: \n- For hydroxyurea: We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine.\n- For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate, complete, and meets the word count limit. However, it is not approved because several sections contain long, complex sentences and technical jargon that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The key messages and background sections, in particular, need to be simplified to improve readability. Addressing the 3 improvements below will significantly enhance clarity for patients and their families.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify long sentences that combine multiple technical terms and definitions.**\n\n- **Why it's a problem:** Sentences that introduce several medical terms and define them in parentheses become very long and hard to follow. This forces the reader to process too much information at once.\n- **Example from the draft:** \"This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and chronic kidney insufficiency (reduced kidney function), with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease (a condition where the kidneys are no longer able to function properly).\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This kidney damage can get worse over time. It can lead to too much protein in the urine (proteinuria) and reduced kidney function. In up to 12% of cases, the kidneys may stop working altogether (end-stage renal disease).\"\n\n**2. Break up sentences that define multiple concepts at once.**\n\n- **Why it's a problem:** The opening summary sentence is 46 words long and contains two separate definitions, which breaks the flow and buries the main finding.\n- **Example from the draft:** \"However, one medicine, hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises), may help children's kidneys to concentrate urine (the process by which the kidneys remove waste and excess fluids from the body).\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"One medicine, hydroxyurea, is used to reduce the frequency of painful crises. Our review found it may also help children's kidneys to concentrate urine. This is the process the kidneys use to remove waste and excess fluids from the body.\"\n\n**3. Use active voice to make the writing more direct and easier to follow.**\n\n- **Why it's a problem:** Passive voice can make the text sound more academic and less direct. The style guide recommends using the active \"we\" form to describe the review authors' actions.\n- **Example from the draft:** \"Unfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Unfortunately, we found no studies on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good conformity in many areas, including sentence length and active voice. However, the analysis confirms the key issues identified in the feedback, showing significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The draft is in the 'BEYOND_P90' percentile for 'nouns' and 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), and in the 'P90' range for 'complex_words' and 'long_words'. The SMOG index of 14.1 is also high, suggesting a reading level that may be too advanced for a general audience. Simplifying the vocabulary and sentence structure as suggested will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a Plain Language Summary."
