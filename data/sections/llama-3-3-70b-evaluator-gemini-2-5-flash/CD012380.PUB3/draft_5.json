  "draft": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain. However, one medicine, hydroxyurea, may help children's kidneys to concentrate urine. This is the process the kidneys use to remove waste and excess fluids from the body.\n\nWe also looked for evidence on red blood cell transfusions. This is a procedure where healthy red blood cells are transferred into the body. Due to a lack of evidence, we cannot say if transfusions or combined treatments are effective for preventing kidney complications.\n\nIn the future, researchers should conduct well-designed studies to assess the benefits and harms of different treatments, including hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, in people with sickle cell disease, particularly in older children and adults.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency, with up to 12% of people developing end-stage renal disease.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases for studies that compared interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. The types of interventions and comparisons included hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, no studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were: \n- For hydroxyurea: We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine. \n- For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",

The main issue is the use of multiple, unexplained technical terms, particularly in the background section. Simplifying this complex vocabulary and defining key treatments more clearly will significantly improve readability. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of complex and long words compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Addressing the three specific points below will make the summary much more accessible to patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has many positive features, with excellent sentence length and high readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease, etc.), placing 72% of its metrics in the best quartile. However, the analysis also flags significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary. The number of nouns, complex words (both general and Dale-Chall), and long words are all in the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is more technical and dense than is ideal for a lay audience. This aligns with the editorial feedback to simplify medical jargon."
