  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at different ways to help healthcare workers reduce their work-related stress. We found that individual-level stress interventions may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. These interventions focus on the experience of stress, like thoughts and feelings, or away from it, like relaxation and exercise. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n\nFuture studies should be better designed and run. They should improve reporting, blind participants, and have larger sample sizes. This would give us more certain evidence and help answer the remaining questions about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often get stressed at work when the job is demanding and they don't have enough support or the right skills to manage. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems, like headaches or stomach issues, which can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare, harming the health of workers and affecting the entire healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nCommon ways to help healthcare workers reduce their stress include stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective individual-level interventions are in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of individual-level interventions.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on individual-level interventions, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions. We found that several types of individual support may reduce stress. These included programs that help people manage stressful thoughts and feelings, and others that use relaxation or exercise to take their minds off the stress. Combining these approaches may also be helpful.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Individual-level stress interventions, such as those that focus on the experience of stress or away from it, may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but more research is needed to confirm their long-term benefits, especially for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors.\n- Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness, and structure. The following 3 suggestions focus on making the language more direct and easier for a lay audience to understand by replacing abstract nouns with active verbs and simplifying key technical terms.\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** Some sentences are dense with abstract nouns, which can make them hard to read. Using verbs instead makes the writing more direct and engaging.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence relies on abstract nouns like 'design', 'execution', and 'reporting'. This style is common in technical writing but can be a barrier for a general audience.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In the future, researchers should design and run better trials. They should report their methods clearly, ensure participants don't know which treatment they are getting (blinding), and include more people. This would give us more certain evidence...\"\n\n2. **Explain or simplify technical terms.** The summary uses some technical phrases that may not be clear to all readers. Explaining them or using simpler alternatives can improve understanding.\n   - **Original phrase:** \"individual-level stress interventions\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a key concept in the review, but the term itself is jargony. It's used multiple times without a simple definition.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** The first time you use it, try explaining it, for example: \"We looked at support programs aimed at helping individual healthcare workers manage their stress (called 'individual-level interventions').\" Afterwards, you could use simpler terms like \"these support programs\" or \"this type of support.\"\n\n3. **Make the findings more specific.** The results section is a bit general. Adding specific details from the review about the types of interventions and how long their effects might last can make the findings more concrete for the reader.\n   - **Original text:** \"We found that several types of individual support may reduce stress. These included programs that help people manage stressful thoughts and feelings, and others that use relaxation or exercise to take their minds off the stress.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a good start, but it misses the key finding about the duration of the effect, which is an important piece of information for readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found that programs aimed at individual healthcare workers may reduce stress for up to a year. Support that focused on managing stressful thoughts and feelings seemed to help. Programs that used relaxation or exercise to take people's minds off stress also seemed to help. Combining these approaches may also be effective.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a very high number of nouns and 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs), making the text less direct than it could be.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 61% of features in the best quartile for readability (e.g., sentence length, reading ease). However, the analysis flags significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure. The counts for nouns (BEYOND_P90), nominalizations (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90) are all higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex, abstract language than is ideal for a lay audience."
