  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at different ways to help healthcare workers reduce their work-related stress. We found that support programs aimed at helping individual healthcare workers manage their stress may help reduce stress symptoms. These programs focus on the experience of stress, like thoughts and feelings, or away from it, like relaxation and exercise. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these programs may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for programs that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n\nIn the future, researchers should design and run better trials. They should report their methods clearly, ensure participants don't know which treatment they are getting, and include more people. This would give us more certain evidence and help answer the remaining questions about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often get stressed at work when the job is demanding and they don't have enough support or the right skills to manage. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems, like headaches or stomach issues, which can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare, harming the health of workers and affecting the entire healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nCommon ways to help healthcare workers reduce their stress include stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers are in reducing stress symptoms. They compared these programs to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of support programs.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of programs. We found that programs aimed at individual healthcare workers may reduce stress for up to a year. Support that focused on managing stressful thoughts and feelings seemed to help. Programs that used relaxation or exercise to take people's minds off stress also seemed to help. Combining these approaches may also be effective.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers, such as those that focus on the experience of stress or away from it, may help reduce stress symptoms, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The effectiveness of these programs may last up to a year, but more research is needed to confirm their long-term benefits, especially for programs that focus on altering work-related risk factors.\n- Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.",

The main issues are the use of technical language and noun-heavy phrases that make the text dense and hard to read. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace technical terms with simpler language.** The text uses several terms that may be unfamiliar to readers.\n   - **Problem:** '...programs that focus on altering work-related risk factors...'\n   - **Suggestion:** '...programs that try to change specific job-related issues, like schedules or workload.'\n\n2. **Explain necessary clinical terms.** Some terms need a brief, simple explanation for a non-medical audience.\n   - **Problem:** '...mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.'\n   - **Suggestion:** '...mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy that helps people change their thinking patterns).'\n\n3. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of noun phrases.** This makes the writing more active and easier to follow.\n   - **Problem:** 'The evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.'\n   - **Suggestion:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited because many studies did not hide which treatment people received (blinding), included only a small number of people, and did not report all their results.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of long words, complex words, and noun-based phrases compared to typical plain language summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis identified significant deviations in vocabulary and word choice. The number of long words (211), complex Dale-Chall words (292), and nouns (210) are all well beyond the 90th percentile, and the use of nominalizations (24) is in the 75th-90th percentile range. These metrics indicate that the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS, which supports the need for simplification."
