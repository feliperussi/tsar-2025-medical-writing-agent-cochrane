  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at different ways to help healthcare workers reduce their work-related stress. We found that support programs aimed at helping individual healthcare workers manage their stress may help reduce stress symptoms. These programs focus on the experience of stress, like thoughts and feelings, or away from it, like relaxation and exercise. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these programs may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for programs that try to change specific job-related issues, like schedules or workload, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n\nIn the future, researchers should design and run better trials. They should report their methods clearly, ensure participants don't know which treatment they are getting, and include more people. This would give us more certain evidence and help answer the remaining questions about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often get stressed at work when the job is demanding and they don't have enough support or the right skills to manage. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems, like headaches or stomach issues, which can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare, harming the health of workers and affecting the entire healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nCommon ways to help healthcare workers reduce their stress include stress management training, mindfulness (a practice that helps people be present and focused), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy that helps people change their thinking patterns). These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers are in reducing stress symptoms. They compared these programs to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of support programs.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of programs. We found that programs aimed at individual healthcare workers may reduce stress for up to a year. Support that focused on managing stressful thoughts and feelings seemed to help. Programs that used relaxation or exercise to take people's minds off stress also seemed to help. Combining these approaches may also be effective.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because many studies did not hide which treatment people received, included only a small number of people, and did not report all their results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers, such as those that focus on the experience of stress or away from it, may help reduce stress symptoms, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The effectiveness of these programs may last up to a year, but more research is needed to confirm their long-term benefits, especially for programs that try to change specific job-related issues, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n- Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too academic and dense, making it difficult to read despite acceptable sentence lengths. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Use more action verbs instead of complex nouns.**\nThe text relies heavily on abstract nouns (a style called 'nominalization'), which makes it feel passive and academic. Rephrasing sentences to use verbs will make them more direct and easier to understand.\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"What are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is noun-heavy (\"interventions for reducing\"). It's abstract and less engaging for the reader.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"How can healthcare workers reduce work-related stress?\"\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"The review authors wanted to find out how effective support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers are in reducing stress symptoms.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is dense with multi-syllable nouns like \"effectiveness,\" \"programs,\" and \"symptoms.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to know if support programs for individual healthcare workers could help lower their stress.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex and long words with simpler alternatives.**\nMany words are too technical or long for a plain language summary. Choosing everyday words will make the text more accessible.\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"This can lead to stress, burnout, and psychosomatic problems...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Psychosomatic\" is medical jargon that a general reader won't understand.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems caused by emotional distress (like headaches or stomach issues)...\"\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"...cognitive-behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy that helps people change their thinking patterns).\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** While you provide a good explanation, the term itself is jargon. It's better to lead with the simple explanation.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...programs that teach people how to change unhelpful thinking patterns (a type of talk therapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy).\"\n\n3. **Break down long sentences with multiple ideas.**\nSome sentences combine several points, which can be overwhelming. Splitting them into shorter, single-idea sentences improves readability.\n\n- **Problematic Quote:** \"Support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers, such as those that focus on the experience of stress or away from it, may help reduce stress symptoms, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence introduces the intervention, gives examples, states the finding, and provides a caveat. It's too much at once.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that support programs for individual workers may help reduce their stress. These programs included ways to manage stressful thoughts or feelings, as well as ways to relax. However, we cannot be certain about these benefits because the evidence we found was not strong.\"\n\nBy focusing on these three areas, you can make the summary much clearer and more helpful for patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity with typical patterns for readability and sentence length, with 78% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and style. Four key metrics are in the P90 range or beyond: nominalization (use of noun forms), total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words. This indicates that the text is too academic, relying heavily on abstract nouns and complex vocabulary, which undermines its goal as a plain language summary."
