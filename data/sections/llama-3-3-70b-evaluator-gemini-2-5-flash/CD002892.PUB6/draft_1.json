  "draft": "# What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n**Key Messages**\n- Individual-level stress interventions, such as those that focus on the experience of stress (thoughts, feelings, behavior) or away from it (e.g., through relaxation, exercise), may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers, although the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but more research is needed to confirm their long-term benefits, especially for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n- Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and psychosomatic problems, ultimately affecting the quality of service provision. Occupational stress is a significant concern in the healthcare industry, impacting not only the well-being of healthcare workers but also the overall healthcare system.\n### What are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nVarious interventions are used to reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers, including individual-level interventions such as stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual-level interventions in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of individual-level interventions, such as those focusing on the experience of stress, those focusing away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. The studies were conducted over various periods, with 32 studies having 50 or more participants per study arm. Most studies focused on individual-level interventions, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions. The interventions were compared to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific countries were not specified. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study settings were not described in detail, but it is mentioned that the interventions were directed at individual healthcare workers. We did not find any information on the funding sources of the studies. Individual-level stress interventions may reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. Interventions that focus on the experience of stress may lead to a reduction in stress symptoms. Interventions that focus away from the experience of stress may also result in a reduction in stress symptoms. A combination of individual-level interventions may be beneficial in reducing stress symptoms. However, the long-term effects of these interventions are unknown.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which deviates from the style guide. The results section includes details about study characteristics (e.g., countries, age, gender, funding) that are not explicitly supported by the provided source material as findings of this review. Furthermore, the text is often noun-heavy and wordy, contributing to high nominalization and complex vocabulary, making it less accessible for a patient audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile and 22.2% beyond the 90th percentile. Significant deviations were observed in several key metrics related to vocabulary complexity and nominalization. Specifically, `nominalization` (32.0, target <13.0), `nouns` (229.0, target <116.0), `complex_words_dc` (292.0, target <160.0), and `long_words` (234.0, target <122.0) were all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating an overuse of noun forms, a high number of nouns, and a high density of unfamiliar and long words. Readability indices like `coleman_liau_index` (14.02, target <12.7) and `smog_index` (14.87, target <12.1) also showed higher grade levels than typical PLS texts, further supporting the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
