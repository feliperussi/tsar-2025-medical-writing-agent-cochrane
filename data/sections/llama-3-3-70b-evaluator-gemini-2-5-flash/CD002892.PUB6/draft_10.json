  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at different ways to help healthcare workers manage their work-related stress. We found that support programs can help reduce stress symptoms. These programs teach healthcare workers how to manage stressful thoughts and feelings or help them relax and focus on something else. However, we are not certain about these benefits because the evidence we found was not strong.\n\nThe benefits of these programs may last up to a year. But we need more research to confirm this, especially for programs that try to change specific job-related issues. \n\nIn the future, researchers should design and run better trials. They should clearly report their methods, ensure participants don't know which treatment they are getting, and include more people. This would give us more certain evidence and help answer the remaining questions about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often get stressed at work when their job is demanding and they don't have enough support or the right skills to manage. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems like headaches or stomach issues, which can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare, harming the health of workers and affecting the entire healthcare system.\n\nHow can healthcare workers reduce work-related stress?\nHealthcare workers can reduce stress through stress management training, mindfulness programs, and talk therapy that helps people change their thinking patterns. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if support programs for individual healthcare workers could help lower their stress. We compared these programs to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. We also looked at different types of support programs.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers, including those that focus on managing stressful thoughts and feelings, and those that help workers relax. We found that programs aimed at individual healthcare workers may reduce stress for up to a year. Programs that teach workers how to manage stressful thoughts and feelings seemed to help. Programs that use relaxation or exercise to take people's minds off stress also seemed to help. Combining these approaches may also be effective.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because many studies did not hide which treatment people received, included only a small number of people, and did not report all their results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Support programs for individual healthcare workers, such as those that focus on managing stressful thoughts and feelings or help workers relax, may help reduce stress symptoms, although we are not certain about these benefits.\n- The benefits of these programs may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm this, especially for programs that try to change specific job-related issues.\n- Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. The main opportunity for improvement is to simplify some of the vocabulary and sentence structures to make the key messages even clearer for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\\n\\n1. **Replace formal terms with simpler, everyday words.** The word 'interventions' is used several times. While technically correct, it's a formal term that can be simplified.\\n   - **Original Text:** \"These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\"\\n   - **Problem:** 'Interventions' and 'enhance their job performance' are jargon that can create a barrier for some readers.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"These approaches aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and help them in their jobs.\"\\n\\n2. **Break down long, noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences, particularly in the key messages, are packed with complex concepts and nouns, which can make them hard to process.\\n   - **Original Text:** \"Future studies should aim to improve the design and execution of trials, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes, to increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\"\\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is dense with abstract nouns ('design', 'execution', 'reporting', 'certainty', 'uncertainties'), making it less direct and harder to read.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In the future, researchers should design and run better studies. They should report their methods clearly, ensure participants don't know which treatment they are getting (blinding), and include more people. This would give us more certain evidence to answer the remaining questions.\"\\n\\n3. **Make descriptions of the programs more direct and active.** The description of what the programs do is a little passive.\\n   - **Original Text:** \"Programs that teach workers how to manage stressful thoughts and feelings seemed to help. Programs that use relaxation or exercise to take people's minds off stress also seemed to help.\"\\n   - **Problem:** The phrasing \"seemed to help\" is slightly weak. Using more direct language can increase clarity and impact.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that programs teaching workers how to manage stressful thoughts and feelings may reduce stress. Similarly, programs that used relaxation or exercise to take workers' minds off stress may also help.\"\\n\\nBy making these changes, the summary will be more accessible and easier for patients and the public to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has excellent readability and sentence structure, with most metrics like sentence length and passive voice falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it deviates from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nouns', 'complex_words_dc' (words unfamiliar to an average reader), and 'long_words' are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more dense and formal than a typical PLS. The feedback focuses on simplifying this vocabulary to better align with plain language principles."
