  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at different ways to help healthcare workers reduce their work-related stress. We found that individual-level stress interventions may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. These interventions focus on the experience of stress, like thoughts and feelings, or away from it, like relaxation and exercise. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n\nFuture studies should be better designed and run. They should improve reporting, blind participants, and have larger sample sizes. This will increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress when they face high demands without enough support or the right skills to cope. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems, like headaches or stomach issues, which can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare, harming the health of workers and affecting the entire healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nCommon ways to help healthcare workers reduce their stress include stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective individual-level interventions are in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of individual-level interventions.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on individual-level interventions, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions. We found that several types of individual support may reduce stress. These included programs that help people focus on their experience of stress, like their thoughts and feelings, and those that help them focus away from it, through relaxation or exercise. Combining these approaches may also be helpful.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The main opportunity for improvement is to simplify some of the vocabulary and phrasing to make the key messages even clearer for a lay audience. The text sometimes uses abstract, noun-heavy language where more direct, simpler words would be more effective. Addressing the 3-4 points below will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top priorities for revision:\n\n1.  **Replace abstract nouns with verbs.** Some sentences rely on noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make the text feel academic and less direct.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"This will increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like \"increase the certainty\" and \"address the uncertainties\" are abstract. Using more direct verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This would give us more certain evidence and help answer the remaining questions about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\"\n\n2.  **Explain technical or abstract concepts with concrete examples.** A key concept in the review is difficult for a lay reader to grasp without a simple explanation.\n    *   **Problematic phrase:** \"...interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors...\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This is technical jargon. A reader may not understand what \"altering work-related risk factors\" means in practice.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...programs that try to change specific job-related issues for an individual, like improving their work schedule or changing their tasks.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify complex phrasing.** Some sentences can be simplified by using more common, everyday words.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"Healthcare workers often experience work-related stress when they face high demands without enough support or the right skills to cope.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** While grammatically correct, phrases like \"experience work-related stress\" and \"face high demands\" are slightly formal. Simpler language would be more direct.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Healthcare workers often get stressed at work when the job is demanding and they don't have enough support or the right skills to manage.\"\n\n4.  **Clarify the different types of interventions.** The core distinction between intervention types is phrased abstractly.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"These included programs that help people focus on their experience of stress, like their thoughts and feelings, and those that help them focus away from it, through relaxation or exercise.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrases \"focus on their experience of stress\" and \"focus away from it\" are academic and a bit clunky.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"These included programs that help people manage stressful thoughts and feelings, and others that use relaxation or exercise to take their minds off the stress.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the text had a high number of nouns, nominalizations, and long words compared to typical plain language summaries. Making these changes will better align the text with plain language principles.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a draft with excellent structural qualities. A high proportion of metrics (72.2%) fall into the best quartile for typical PLS patterns, including very good readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.85), low sentence length (16 words), and strong use of active voice. However, the analysis also highlights a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics—'nominalization', 'nouns', 'complex_words_dc', and 'long_words'—are in the P90 range, indicating that the text is denser and more abstract than a typical PLS, despite its simple sentence structure. The feedback focuses on simplifying this vocabulary to improve clarity."
