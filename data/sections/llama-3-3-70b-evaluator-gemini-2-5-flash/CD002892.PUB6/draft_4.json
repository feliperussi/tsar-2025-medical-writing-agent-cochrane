  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe found that individual-level stress interventions may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. These interventions focus on the experience of stress (like thoughts, feelings, behavior) or away from it (like relaxation, exercise). However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n\nFuture studies should be better designed and run. They should improve reporting, blind participants, and have larger sample sizes. This will increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems caused by mental stress (like headaches or stomach issues), ultimately affecting the quality of care that patients receive. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare. It harms the health of workers and can also affect the entire healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nVarious interventions are used to reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. These include individual-level interventions like stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective individual-level interventions are in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of individual-level interventions.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence. We included 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on individual-level interventions, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that several types of interventions may reduce stress for healthcare workers. These included approaches that focus on the experience of stress (like mindfulness) and those that focus away from it (like exercise). Combining different interventions may also be beneficial. However, the long-term effects of these interventions are unknown.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of formal, noun-heavy language and a structural problem where a key result is placed in the methods section. Addressing these points will make the summary more direct and easier to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns and passive voice with active verbs.** The text often uses formal nouns where simpler verbs would be clearer. This makes the writing less direct.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Various interventions are used to reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is passive and uses the formal noun \"interventions\". It's not clear who is doing the action, and the language is academic.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We looked at different ways to help healthcare workers reduce their work-related stress.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and formal phrasing.** Some phrases are too academic and can be simplified to be more accessible to patients and the public.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems caused by mental stress (like headaches or stomach issues), ultimately affecting the quality of care that patients receive.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"ultimately affecting the quality of care that patients receive\" is wordy and abstract. A simpler, more direct phrase would be better.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...This can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients.\"\n\n3. **Move results out of the 'Methods' section.** The methods section should only describe *how* the review was done, not *what* was found. Including results here can confuse readers.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** In the \"How did we conduct the review?\" section, the text states: \"We included 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is a key finding of the review and belongs in the 'Results' section (\"What did we find?\").\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Remove that sentence from the methods section and ensure it is the first sentence in the \"What did we find?\" section. The methods section could simply read: \"We searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of nouns, nominalizations (nouns made from verbs), and complex words compared to typical plain language summaries. Making these changes will help make the text more direct and easier for readers to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity, with high counts for nominalization (P90), total nouns (P90), complex words from the Dale-Chall list (P90), and long words (P90). This indicates that while the sentences are short, the word choice is more academic and noun-heavy than is typical for a plain language summary, which could hinder reader comprehension."
