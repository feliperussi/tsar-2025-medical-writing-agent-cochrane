  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at different ways to help healthcare workers reduce their work-related stress. We found that individual-level stress interventions may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. These interventions focus on the experience of stress, like thoughts and feelings, or away from it, like relaxation and exercise. However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n\nFuture studies should be better designed and run. They should improve reporting, blind participants, and have larger sample sizes. This will increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical problems, like headaches or stomach issues, which can make it harder for them to provide good care to patients. Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare, harming the health of workers and affecting the entire healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nWe help healthcare workers reduce their stress through various methods, including stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective individual-level interventions are in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of individual-level interventions.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on individual-level interventions, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions. We found that individual-level stress interventions may reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. Interventions that focus on the experience of stress may lead to a reduction in stress symptoms. Interventions that focus away from the experience of stress may also result in a reduction in stress symptoms. A combination of individual-level interventions may be beneficial in reducing stress symptoms. However, the long-term effects of these interventions are unknown.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, a few key improvements to clarity and style will make it much easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make the results less repetitive.** The 'What did we find?' section repeats similar phrases several times, which can be tiring for the reader.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'We found that individual-level stress interventions may reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. Interventions that focus on the experience of stress may lead to a reduction in stress symptoms. Interventions that focus away from the experience of stress may also result in a reduction in stress symptoms.'\n    *   **Consider this rewrite:** 'We found that several types of individual support may reduce stress. These included programs that help people focus on their experience of stress (like their thoughts and feelings) and those that help them focus away from it (through relaxation or exercise). Combining these approaches may also be helpful.'\n\n2. **Clarify the role of the review authors.** In the section 'What are the common interventions...', the text says 'We help healthcare workers...'. In a Cochrane review, 'we' refers to the and review authors, who study interventions but do not provide them. This can confuse the reader.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'We help healthcare workers reduce their stress through various methods...'\n    *   **Consider this rewrite:** 'Common ways to help healthcare workers reduce their stress include...'\n\n3. **Simplify abstract language.** Some phrases are taken directly from the technical abstract and may be unclear to a lay audience.\n    *   **Instead of:** '...due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work.'\n    *   **Consider this rewrite:** '...when they face high demands without enough support or the right skills to cope.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of noun-forms ('nominalization') and long words. Using more direct verbs and simpler terms will address these points and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis flagged four metrics for potential improvement: the use of noun-forms ('nominalization'), total noun count, and the number of long or complex words were higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests that simplifying vocabulary and using more active verbs could further improve clarity."
