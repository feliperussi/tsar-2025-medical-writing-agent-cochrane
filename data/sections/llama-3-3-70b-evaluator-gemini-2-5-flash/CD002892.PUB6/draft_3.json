  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\n- We found that individual-level stress interventions may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. These interventions focus on the experience of stress (like thoughts, feelings, behavior) or away from it (like relaxation, exercise). However, the quality of evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed.\n- The effectiveness of these interventions may last up to a year, but we need more research to confirm their long-term benefits. This is especially true for interventions that focus on altering work-related risk factors, which currently have very uncertain effects.\n- Future studies should improve their design and execution, including better reporting, blinding of participants, and larger sample sizes. This will increase the certainty of the evidence and address the remaining uncertainties about the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and psychosomatic problems, which can affect the quality of care that patients receive. Occupational stress is a significant concern in the healthcare industry, impacting not only the well-being of healthcare workers but also the overall healthcare system.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nVarious interventions are used to reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. These include individual-level interventions like stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. These interventions aim to help healthcare workers manage stress, improve their well-being, and enhance their job performance.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective individual-level interventions are in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of individual-level interventions.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on stress-reduction interventions for healthcare workers, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence. We included 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies focused on individual-level interventions, including those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, and combinations of interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that several types of interventions may reduce stress for healthcare workers. These included approaches that focus on the experience of stress (like mindfulness) and those that focus away from it (like exercise). Combining different interventions may also be beneficial. However, the long-term effects of these interventions are unknown.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of technical terms, noun-heavy phrases, and wordiness that make the text feel more academic than it should. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace noun forms with active verbs.** Some sentences are less direct because they use nouns instead of verbs to describe actions. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future studies should improve their design and execution...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Design and execution\" is a noun phrase that makes the sentence feel formal and less direct. Using verbs makes it clearer what should happen.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should be better designed and run...\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and technical words.** To be a true plain language summary, the text must avoid jargon that a patient or member of the public might not understand.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...and psychosomatic problems...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Psychosomatic\" is a technical term that is not common knowledge.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and physical problems caused by mental stress (like headaches or stomach issues)...\"\n\n3. **Make noun-heavy sentences more direct and concise.** Some sentences rely on abstract nouns, which can make them harder to read and less engaging.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Occupational stress is a significant concern in the healthcare industry, impacting not only the well-being of healthcare workers but also the overall healthcare system.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is quite formal and uses abstract phrases like \"significant concern\" and \"well-being.\" Simpler language would be more effective.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Work-related stress is a major problem in healthcare. It harms the health of workers and can also affect the entire healthcare system.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in many areas, particularly with short sentences and strong use of active voice. However, it highlights significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The draft scored in the P90 range for 'nominalization' (23), 'nouns' (173), 'long_words' (180), and 'complex_words_dc' (233), indicating that the text uses more noun-form verbs, abstract nouns, and long, uncommon words than is typical for a plain language summary. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and use more direct, verb-driven sentences."
