  "draft": "What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- We don't know which treatments are best for blocked dialysis access. \n- Surgical procedures may improve how well the dialysis access stays open (its patency) at 30 days compared to mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to remove the blood clot), but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for blocked dialysis access.\n\nWhat is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often require haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. For haemodialysis to work, the dialysis machine needs to connect to the patient's bloodstream. Doctors usually create a special access point called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). However, these access points can sometimes become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents patients from receiving the dialysis they need. Thrombosis of AVF or AVG is a significant problem because it can lead to infections, blockages in the large veins near the heart, and repeated hospital stays.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients undergoing haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions are most effective in restoring the function of the AVF or AVG, and which have the fewest adverse effects.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies that looked at treatments for blocked dialysis access. We then compared the results and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess how well the treatments worked and what risks they had.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur search strategy identified 14 eligible studies (1176 randomised participants) for inclusion in this review. We looked at three types of treatments: 1) thrombectomy (procedures to remove the blood clot), 2) thrombolysis (medicines to dissolve the blood clot), and 3) surgery. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to a poor study design, a low number of patients, and industry involvement. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention was better than another for the outcomes of failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting (this is known as a lack of \"blinding\"), which can affect the results. The evidence is also limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

However, a few key sentences use technical terms without explanation, which could prevent a reader from fully understanding the main results and limitations. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make this an excellent Plain Language Summary.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Explain the technical outcomes in the 'Results' section.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Overall, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention was better than another for the outcomes of failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence lists several technical outcomes ('failure', 'technical success', 'adverse events') without explaining what they mean to a patient. This makes the main finding of the review difficult to understand.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Overall, we did not have enough evidence to say if one treatment was better than another at preventing the access from failing, working correctly right after the procedure (technical success), or causing unwanted effects.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the formal language used to introduce the results.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Our search strategy identified 14 eligible studies (1176 randomised participants) for inclusion in this review.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is very formal and academic. Plain language summaries should use a more direct and conversational tone to be accessible.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found 14 studies that included a total of 1176 people.\"\n\n**3. Replace jargon in the 'Limitations' section.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is also limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The term \"outcomes of interest\" is research jargon. A patient might not understand what this refers to.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is also limited because the studies were very small and did not always report on the results we were looking for.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and simplicity. Metrics like average sentence length (19.48 words) and active voice count (45) are excellent. The overall high scores for simplicity highlight a few specific sentences where unexplained technical terms stand out, which is the primary area for improvement."
