  "draft": "# What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types and interventions (treatments) for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure are unclear, including their potential to improve or worsen the condition (patency at 30 days or failure).\n- Comparing different types of interventions, such as surgical procedures, thrombectomy (a procedure to remove a blood clot), and thrombolysis (a procedure to dissolve a blood clot), did not show that one is clearly better than the others for treating blocked dialysis access, although surgical procedures may have some benefits in certain cases.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects and outcomes of these interventions that are important to patients and healthcare providers, including their benefits, potential harms, and costs, to determine the best treatment approaches for blocked dialysis access.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often need haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to do so. To receive haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their blood. This is typically done through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG), which are surgically created connections between an artery and a vein. However, sometimes these connections can become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents haemodialysis from working properly. Thrombosis can lead to serious complications, including infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations. Common treatments for thrombosed AVF and AVG include thrombectomy (removing the blockage) and thrombolysis (dissolving the blockage), but it's unclear which treatment is most effective.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients receiving haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions work best to restore blood flow and prevent further complications, and to identify any potential harms or side effects associated with these treatments. By comparing the results of different studies, the authors hoped to provide clarity on the best approach for managing thrombosed AVF and AVG, and to inform clinical decision-making for patients with kidney disease.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies evaluating interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. No date or language restrictions were applied. Search terms combined synonyms for \"thrombosis\", \"haemodialysis\", \"arteriovenous fistula\", \"graft\", and specific intervention names.\n### Eligibility Criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies that compared any therapeutic or surgical intervention aimed at restoring patency of thrombosed haemodialysis fistulas or grafts with either another active treatment or standard care. Studies had to report at least one clinical outcome related to effectiveness (e.g., primary patency, secondary patency) or safety (e.g., complications, infection).\n### Study Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus or a third reviewer. Data extracted included study design, participant characteristics, type of vascular access, intervention details, comparator, follow‑up duration, and outcome measures. Extraction was performed using a pre‑piloted form.\n### Risk of Bias Assessment\nRisk of bias for randomized trials was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and for non‑randomized studies with the ROBINS‑I tool. Domains assessed included randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting.\n### Data Synthesis and Confidence Rating\nWhere feasible, meta‑analyses were performed using a random‑effects model to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was explored with I² statistics. The GRADE approach was applied to rate confidence in the body of evidence, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1176 people with thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. The studies were conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety of interventions for failed AVF and AVG in patients receiving haemodialysis. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to a poor study design, a low number of patients, and industry involvement. The studies included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: types of thrombectomy, types of thrombolysis, and surgical procedures. However, there is limited information available on the duration of the studies, population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources. It is unclear if interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have an effect on outcomes such as failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events. The current evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues and significant deviations from Cochrane Plain Language Summary guidelines. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Word Count:** The draft is 895 words, exceeding the 850-word limit. This needs to be reduced to improve conciseness and readability.\n2.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings in the 'Methods' section are not phrased as questions, which violates the style guide. For example, 'Search Strategy' should be rephrased as a question like 'How did we search for studies?'\n\n**Top 5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Reduce Sentence Length and Simplify Complex Phrases:** Many sentences are overly long and contain technical or wordy phrases that hinder understanding for a lay audience. \n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types and interventions (treatments) for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure are unclear, including their potential to improve or worsen the condition (patency at 30 days or failure).\" (Key Messages)\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This 46-word sentence is dense and uses terms like 'robust evidence' and 'patency at 30 days or failure' which are not immediately clear to a general reader. It's a key message, so it needs to be highly accessible.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Because there isn't enough strong evidence, we don't know the benefits or risks of most treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure. This includes whether treatments improve or worsen the condition (how well the access stays open after 30 days, or if it fails).\"\n\n2.  **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice and Reduce Nominalization:** The draft frequently uses passive constructions and noun forms of verbs, making the text less direct and harder to follow.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies evaluating interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** \"A search was conducted\" is passive voice. \"Evaluating interventions\" is a nominalization. This makes the sentence less engaging and clear about who performed the action.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies about treatments for blocked haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Vocabulary and Reduce Noun-Heavy Constructions:** The text is often dense with formal and technical nouns and long words, significantly impacting readability.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients receiving haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions work best to restore blood flow and prevent further complications, and to identify any potential harms or side effects associated with these treatments.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This paragraph is packed with formal nouns ('effectiveness,' 'safety,' 'interventions,' 'complications,' 'harms,' 'side effects') and long words, contributing to a low readability score.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well different treatments for blocked AVF and AVG work, and if they are safe for people on haemodialysis. We aimed to see which treatments best bring back blood flow, stop more problems, and if they cause any side effects.\"\n\n4.  **Reformat Methods Subheadings as Questions:** Adhere to the style guide by phrasing all subheadings as questions.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Search and Eligibility Criteria,\" \"Study Selection and Data Extraction,\" \"Risk of Bias Assessment,\" \"Data Synthesis and Confidence Rating\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These are statements, not questions, which is a direct violation of the 'Structure' section of the Master Style Guide.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite Examples:** \"How did we search for studies?\", \"Which studies did we include?\", \"How did we select studies and collect data?\", \"How did we assess the risk of bias?\", \"How did we combine and rate the evidence?\"\n\n5.  **Add Blank Lines for Improved Readability:** Ensure there are blank lines between all headings and paragraphs to improve visual separation and readability.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** Missing blank lines after 'Key Messages' and 'Introduction' section titles before the content begins.\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This creates a dense block of text, making it harder for readers to visually process the information and navigate the document, contrary to the 'White space' guideline.\n    *   **Suggested Action:** Add a blank line after 'Key Messages' and 'Introduction' (and any other section titles) before the subsequent content.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis (PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS) strongly supports these recommendations. The draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with 12 out of 18 features falling 'BEYOND_P90' or 'BELOW_P10'. Key metrics indicating poor readability include a low Flesch Reading Ease (28.07, P10) and high Flesch-Kincaid Grade (16.08, BEYOND_P90). Sentence structure is problematic with high words_per_sentence (27.12, P90) and excessive passive_voice (30, BEYOND_P90). Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, with very high counts for complex_words_dc (399, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (238, BEYOND_P90), long_words (344, BEYOND_P90), and nouns (294, BEYOND_P90), alongside high nominalization (31, BEYOND_P90). Addressing these issues will significantly improve the clarity and accessibility of the summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns, with 12 out of 18 evaluated features falling into the 'BEYOND_P90' or 'BEYOND_P10' percentile ranges. This suggests the text is considerably more complex and less readable than typical PLS documents. Specifically, readability indices like Flesch Reading Ease (28.07, P10) are very low, while Flesch-Kincaid Grade (16.08, BEYOND_P90), Gunning Fog Index (21.49, BEYOND_P90), SMOG Index (18.39, BEYOND_P90), and Automated Readability Index (17.49, BEYOND_P90) are exceptionally high, indicating a very high reading difficulty. Sentence structure is problematic with a high average of words_per_sentence (27.12, P90) and an excessive number of passive_voice constructions (30, BEYOND_P90). Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, with extremely high counts for complex_words_dc (399, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (238, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (344, BEYOND_P90). Additionally, the text is very noun-heavy (294 nouns, BEYOND_P90) and uses a high degree of nominalization (31, BEYOND_P90). These deviations collectively point to a text that is too long, too complex, and too formal for a plain language summary aimed at patients."
