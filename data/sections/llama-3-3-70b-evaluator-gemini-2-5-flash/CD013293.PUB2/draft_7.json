  "draft": "What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure?\n\nKey Messages\n- We don't know the benefits or risks of most treatments for blocked dialysis access in people with kidney failure. This includes whether treatments improve or worsen the condition.\n- Comparing different treatments, such as surgery, thrombectomy (removing a blood clot), and thrombolysis (dissolving a blood clot), did not show that one is clearly better than the others for treating blocked dialysis access. However, surgery may have some benefits in certain cases.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects and outcomes of these treatments that are important to patients and healthcare providers.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often need haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to do so. To receive haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their blood. This is typically done through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG), which are surgically created connections between an artery and a vein. However, sometimes these connections can become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents haemodialysis from working properly. Thrombosis can lead to serious complications, including infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different treatments for blocked AVF and AVG work, and if they are safe for people on haemodialysis. We aimed to see which treatments best bring back blood flow, stop more problems, and if they cause any side effects.\n\nMethods\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies about treatments for blocked haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts.\n\nWhich studies did we include?\nWe included randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies that compared any therapeutic or surgical intervention aimed at restoring patency of thrombosed haemodialysis fistulas or grafts with either another active treatment or standard care.\n\nHow did we select studies and collect data?\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and then full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus or a third reviewer. We extracted data including study design, participant characteristics, type of vascular access, intervention details, comparator, follow-up duration, and outcome measures.\n\nHow did we assess the risk of bias?\nWe evaluated the risk of bias for randomized trials with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and for non-randomized studies with the ROBINS-I tool.\n\nHow did we combine and rate the evidence?\nWhere feasible, we performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. We applied the GRADE approach to rate confidence in the body of evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1176 people with thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, a low number of patients, and industry involvement. The studies included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: types of thrombectomy, types of thrombolysis, and surgical procedures. However, there is limited information available on the duration of the studies, population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources. It is unclear if interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have an effect on outcomes such as failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it is not yet ready for publication. It fails a critical check because two subheadings ('Limitations' and 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. More importantly, the summary contains several sections with overly technical language that would be difficult for a patient to understand. The methods section, in particular, reads like a technical report rather than a plain language summary. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to make this summary clear and accessible for your audience:\n\n1. **Rewrite the entire 'Methods' section in plain language.** The current version is filled with technical jargon that is not suitable for a lay audience. It describes the 'how' in a way only a researcher would understand.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We evaluated the risk of bias for randomized trials with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and for non-randomized studies with the ROBINS-I tool... we performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes... We applied the GRADE approach to rate confidence in the body of evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Patients do not need to know the specific names of statistical tools or methods. Terms like 'meta-analyses', 'risk ratios', and 'GRADE approach' are meaningless to most readers and create a barrier to understanding.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine the five short methods paragraphs into one or two simple ones. For example: \"To find studies, we searched major medical databases. We looked for studies that compare different treatments for blocked dialysis access in adults. We were most interested in studies that randomly assigned people to a treatment group, as these provide the most reliable evidence. We then compared and summarized the results of the studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex and noun-heavy phrases with simpler, everyday language.** The text has many long words and uses nouns where simpler verbs would be clearer. This makes sentences difficult to read.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"It is unclear if interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have an effect on outcomes such as failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and packed with technical terms. 'Interventions', 'primary patency', and 'adverse events' are jargon.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We are not sure if the treatments worked to unblock the dialysis access, if the access stayed open for 30 days, or if the treatments caused any unwanted side effects.\"\n\n3. **Ensure all subheadings are questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. Two subheadings in the draft do not follow this rule.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** These single-word headings are not as engaging or clear as questions.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Change \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and change \"Currency\" to \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your own analysis supports these recommendations. The summary has a very high number of complex words, long words, and nouns, placing it in the 'BEYOND_P90' category for these metrics. The SMOG index (a measure of complexity) is also unusually high. Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics in line with typical Plain Language Summaries and, more importantly, make the text much easier for patients to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in some areas, such as word count and active voice usage. However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in key areas related to readability and vocabulary complexity. Five metrics are outside the normal range: 'nouns', 'long_words', 'complex_words', 'complex_words_dc', and the 'smog_index' are all in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates that the text uses vocabulary that is significantly more complex and technical than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which supports the editorial recommendation to simplify language and reduce jargon."
