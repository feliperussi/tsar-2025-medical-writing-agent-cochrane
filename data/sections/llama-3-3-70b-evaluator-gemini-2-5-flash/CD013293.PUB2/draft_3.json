  "draft": "What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- We don't know which treatments are best for blocked dialysis access. \n- Surgical procedures may improve the patency of the dialysis access at 30 days compared to mechanical thrombectomy, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for blocked dialysis access.\n\nWhat is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often require haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. For haemodialysis to work, the dialysis machine needs to connect to the patient's bloodstream. Doctors usually create a special access point called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). However, these access points can sometimes become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents patients from receiving the dialysis they need. Thrombosis of AVF or AVG is a significant problem because it can lead to infections, blockages in the large veins near the heart, and repeated hospital stays.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients undergoing haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions are most effective in restoring the function of the AVF or AVG, and which have the fewest adverse effects.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur search strategy identified 14 eligible studies (1176 randomised participants) for inclusion in this review. We included 3 types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: 1) types of thrombectomy, 2) types of thrombolysis, and 3) surgical procedures. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to a poor study design, a low number of patients, and industry involvement. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention was better than another for the outcomes of failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. The main issue is the use of technical terms without explanation, which can be confusing for readers. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define key medical and research terms for the reader.** Several important terms are used without a simple explanation. The original source material provided these definitions, and they should be included.\n    *   **In the 'Key messages' and 'Main results' sections:** Explain what 'thrombectomy' and 'thrombolysis' are.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We included 3 types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: 1) types of thrombectomy, 2) types of thrombolysis, and 3) surgical procedures.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We looked at three types of treatments: 1) thrombectomy (procedures to remove the blood clot), 2) thrombolysis (medicines to dissolve the blood clot), and 3) surgery.'\n    *   **In the 'Key messages' section:** Explain what 'patency' means.\n    *   **Problem:** 'Surgical procedures may improve the patency of the dialysis access at 30 days...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Surgical procedures may improve how well the dialysis access stays open (its patency) at 30 days...'\n\n2. **Explain the term 'blinding' in the limitations.** This is a research-specific term that will not be familiar to most readers.\n    *   **Problem:** 'The evidence is limited by... possible lack of blinding...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'The evidence is limited because... in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting (this is known as a lack of \"blinding\"), which can affect the results.'\n\n3. **Make the 'Methods' section more direct and easier to read.** The current version is a single, dense sentence. Breaking it into two shorter sentences would improve clarity.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We searched for studies on interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We searched for studies that looked at treatments for blocked dialysis access. We then compared the results and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess how well the treatments worked and what risks they had.'\n\nWhile the draft's overall readability scores are within the typical range, the vocabulary complexity metrics are on the higher side (P75). Addressing these specific key terms will significantly improve reader understanding.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns, with all metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, metrics for vocabulary complexity (complex_words, complex_words_dc) and nominalizations are in the 75th percentile, indicating the text is on the higher end of complexity for a PLS. This aligns with the editorial finding that several key technical terms are left undefined, which hinders readability despite acceptable overall metrics."
