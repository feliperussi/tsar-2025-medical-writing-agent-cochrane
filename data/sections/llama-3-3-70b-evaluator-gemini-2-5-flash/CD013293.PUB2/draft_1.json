  "draft": "# What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear which treatments are best for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease, including the benefits and risks of different interventions such as thrombectomy (a procedure to remove a blood clot), thrombolysis (a procedure to dissolve a blood clot), and surgery.\n- Surgical procedures may improve the patency (the state of being open or unblocked) of the dialysis access at 30 days compared to mechanical thrombectomy, but the evidence is very uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for blocked dialysis access, including their potential unwanted effects, to provide clearer guidance for people with kidney disease and their healthcare providers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often require haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. To undergo haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their bloodstream, which is typically achieved through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). However, these access points can sometimes become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents patients from receiving the dialysis they need. Thrombosis of AVF or AVG is a significant problem because it can lead to infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations. Common treatments for thrombosed AVF and AVG include thrombectomy (removing the blood clot) and thrombolysis (dissolving the blood clot), as well as surgical procedures.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients undergoing haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions are most effective in restoring the function of the AVF or AVG, and which have the fewest adverse effects. The authors also sought to compare the outcomes of different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and surgical procedures, and to assess the quality of the evidence supporting these interventions.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions.\n**Results**\n### Explanation\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed. This limit is in place to prevent endless loops and ensure the system remains responsive. If you need further assistance, please refine your request or break it into smaller steps.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the Master Style Guide. Most importantly, the 'Results' section contains an agent error message instead of the actual review findings, which is a critical factual omission. Additionally, the text deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns in terms of sentence length and vocabulary complexity, making it harder for a patient audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. Only 33.3% of features fall into the best quartile, with 50% in the P90 range and 11.1% beyond P90. Key areas of deviation include: \n- **Readability Indices:** Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.3, P90), Automated Readability Index (16.8, P90), Coleman-Liau Index (14.0, P90), Gunning Fog Index (19.9, P90), SMOG Index (13.95, P90), LIX (63.26, BEYOND_P90), and RIX (9.79, BEYOND_P90) all suggest the text is more difficult to read than typical PLS. \n- **Sentence Structure:** The average words per sentence (27.0, P90) is higher than typical, indicating longer sentences. \n- **Vocabulary Complexity:** Metrics for complex words (Dale-Chall: 217.0, P90; 3+ syllables: 117.0, P90) and long words (7+ characters: 186.0, P90) are all higher than typical, suggesting more challenging vocabulary. These deviations confirm the need for shorter sentences and simpler language to improve readability."
