  "draft": "What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear which treatments are best for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease, including the benefits and risks of different interventions such as thrombectomy (a procedure to remove a blood clot), thrombolysis (a procedure to dissolve a blood clot), and surgery.\n- Surgical procedures may improve the patency (the state of being open or unblocked) of the dialysis access at 30 days compared to mechanical thrombectomy, but the evidence is very uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for blocked dialysis access, including their potential unwanted effects, to provide clearer guidance for people with kidney disease and their healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often require haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. To undergo haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their bloodstream, which is typically achieved through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). However, these access points can sometimes become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents patients from receiving the dialysis they need. Thrombosis of AVF or AVG is a significant problem because it can lead to infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations. Common treatments for thrombosed AVF and AVG include thrombectomy (removing the blood clot) and thrombolysis (dissolving the blood clot), as well as surgical procedures.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients undergoing haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions are most effective in restoring the function of the AVF or AVG, and which have the fewest adverse effects. The authors also sought to compare the outcomes of different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and surgical procedures, and to assess the quality of the evidence supporting these interventions.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur search strategy identified 14 eligible studies (1176 randomised participants) for inclusion in this review. We included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: (1) types of thrombectomy, (2) types of thrombolysis and (3) surgical procedures. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to a poor study design, a low number of patients and industry involvement. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention was better than another for the outcomes of failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success and adverse events (both major and minor). Primary patency at 30 days may improve with surgical compared to mechanical thrombectomy (3 studies, 404 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.67); however, the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and complete, but it is not yet ready for publication. The language is too complex for a lay audience, which will prevent many readers from understanding these important findings. The top 3 improvements needed are:\n\n1. **Shorten very long sentences.** Many sentences are over 30 words long, combining multiple ideas. This makes them difficult to follow.\n    *   **Example:** 'Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear which treatments are best for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney disease, including the benefits and risks of different interventions such as thrombectomy (a procedure to remove a blood clot), thrombolysis (a procedure to dissolve a blood clot), and surgery.' (53 words)\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into two simpler sentences. For example: 'We don't know which treatments are best for blocked dialysis access. There is not enough good evidence to be sure of the benefits and risks of different treatments like thrombectomy (removing a clot), thrombolysis (dissolving a clot), and surgery.'\n\n2. **Explain or replace medical jargon.** The summary includes technical terms that a patient is unlikely to understand.\n    *   **Example:** 'Thrombosis of AVF or AVG is a significant problem because it can lead to infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace 'central venous occlusions' with a plain language explanation. For example: '...it can lead to infections, blockages in the large veins near the heart, and repeated hospital stays.'\n\n3. **Simplify formal and wordy phrasing.** The tone is often academic rather than conversational, making the text less accessible.\n    *   **Example:** 'To undergo haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their bloodstream, which is typically achieved through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use more direct, active language. For example: 'For haemodialysis to work, the dialysis machine needs to connect to the patient's bloodstream. Doctors usually create a special access point called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG).'\n\nThese issues are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows the text has a university-level reading difficulty (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 15.3) and much longer sentences (26.4 words on average) than a typical Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the required word count. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in terms of readability and complexity. A total of 13 out of 18 metrics fall outside the typical median range, with 4 metrics rated 'BEYOND_P90', indicating extreme deviation. Key problem areas identified by the metrics include very long sentences (`words_per_sentence` is 26.4), a high number of complex and long words (`complex_words` and `long_words` are 'BEYOND_P90'), and consequently, very poor readability scores (e.g., `flesch_reading_ease` is in the lowest P10 range, while `flesch_kincaid_grade` is at a university level of 15.3)."
