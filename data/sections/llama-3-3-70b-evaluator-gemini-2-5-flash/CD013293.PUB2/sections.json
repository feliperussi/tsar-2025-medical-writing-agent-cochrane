  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types and interventions (treatments) for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure are unclear, including their potential to improve or worsen the condition (patency at 30 days or failure).",
    "Comparing different types of interventions, such as surgical procedures, thrombectomy (a procedure to remove a blood clot), and thrombolysis (a procedure to dissolve a blood clot), did not show that one is clearly better than the others for treating blocked dialysis access, although surgical procedures may have some benefits in certain cases.",
    "Future research should focus on studying the effects and outcomes of these interventions that are important to patients and healthcare providers, including their benefits, potential harms, and costs, to determine the best treatment approaches for blocked dialysis access."

      "content": "Patients with kidney disease often need haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to do so. To receive haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their blood. This is typically done through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG), which are surgically created connections between an artery and a vein. However, sometimes these connections can become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents haemodialysis from working properly. Thrombosis can lead to serious complications, including infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations. Common treatments for thrombosed AVF and AVG include thrombectomy (removing the blockage) and thrombolysis (dissolving the blockage), but it's unclear which treatment is most effective."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for thrombosed AVF and AVG in patients receiving haemodialysis. They wanted to establish which interventions work best to restore blood flow and prevent further complications, and to identify any potential harms or side effects associated with these treatments. By comparing the results of different studies, the authors hoped to provide clarity on the best approach for managing thrombosed AVF and AVG, and to inform clinical decision-making for patients with kidney disease."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies evaluating interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. No date or language restrictions were applied. Search terms combined synonyms for \"thrombosis\", \"haemodialysis\", \"arteriovenous fistula\", \"graft\", and specific intervention names."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "We included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies that compared any therapeutic or surgical intervention aimed at restoring patency of thrombosed haemodialysis fistulas or grafts with either another active treatment or standard care. Studies had to report at least one clinical outcome related to effectiveness (e.g., primary patency, secondary patency) or safety (e.g., complications, infection)."

      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus or a third reviewer. Data extracted included study design, participant characteristics, type of vascular access, intervention details, comparator, follow‑up duration, and outcome measures. Extraction was performed using a pre‑piloted form."

      "content": "Risk of bias for randomized trials was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and for non‑randomized studies with the ROBINS‑I tool. Domains assessed included randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting."

      "content": "Where feasible, meta‑analyses were performed using a random‑effects model to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was explored with I² statistics. The GRADE approach was applied to rate confidence in the body of evidence, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 14 studies that involved 1176 people with thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. The studies were conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety of interventions for failed AVF and AVG in patients receiving haemodialysis. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to a poor study design, a low number of patients, and industry involvement. The studies included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: types of thrombectomy, types of thrombolysis, and surgical procedures. However, there is limited information available on the duration of the studies, population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources. It is unclear if interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have an effect on outcomes such as failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events. The current evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
