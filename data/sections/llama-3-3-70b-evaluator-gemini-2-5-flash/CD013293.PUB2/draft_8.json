  "draft": "What are the best treatments for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft) in people with kidney failure?\n\nKey Messages\n- We don't know the benefits or risks of most treatments for blocked dialysis access in people with kidney failure. This includes whether treatments improve or worsen the condition.\n- Comparing different treatments, such as surgery, thrombectomy (removing a blood clot), and thrombolysis (dissolving a blood clot), did not show that one is clearly better than the others for treating blocked dialysis access. However, surgery may have some benefits in certain cases.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects and outcomes of these treatments that are important to patients and healthcare providers.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nPatients with kidney disease often need haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to do so. To receive haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their blood. This is typically done through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG), which are surgically created connections between an artery and a vein. However, sometimes these connections can become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents haemodialysis from working properly. Thrombosis can lead to serious complications, including infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different treatments for blocked AVF and AVG work, and if they are safe for people on haemodialysis. We aimed to see which treatments best bring back blood flow, stop more problems, and if they cause any side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nTo find studies, we searched major medical databases. We looked for studies that compare different treatments for blocked dialysis access in adults. We were most interested in studies that randomly assigned people to a treatment group, as these provide the most reliable evidence. We then compared and summarized the results of the studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1176 people with thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, a low number of patients, and industry involvement. The studies included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: types of thrombectomy, types of thrombolysis, and surgical procedures. However, there is limited information available on the duration of the studies, population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources. We are not sure if the treatments worked to unblock the dialysis access, if the access stayed open for 30 days, or if the treatments caused any unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

However, it is not approved because there are several opportunities to improve clarity and readability for a patient audience. The main issues are: 1) The first subheading uses complex medical terms that may intimidate readers before they have a chance to read the explanation. \"2) The text uses more long, formal words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, making it harder to read. 3) The 'What did we find?' section is a bit vague and could be improved by including the one specific (though uncertain) finding about surgery that is mentioned in the key messages.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with over 66% of features falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, the metric for 'long_words' (words with 7+ characters) is in the 90th percentile, indicating a higher use of long words than is typical for a PLS. This suggests an opportunity to improve readability by replacing some longer words with simpler alternatives."
