  "draft": "Is intravenous iron (given through a vein) better than oral iron (taken by mouth) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that intravenous iron likely slightly increases hemoglobin levels (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and reduces anemia in pregnant women compared to oral iron.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether intravenous iron increases or decreases the risk of unwanted effects such as severe infections, prolonged hospital stays, or admissions to intensive care units.\n- Future research should look at the long-term effects of both treatments, focus on results that matter most to mothers and babies, and clearly report any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy?\nIron deficiency anemia is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of hemoglobin (a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen). In pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia can occur due to the increased demand for iron to support the growth of the baby. If left untreated, iron deficiency anemia can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy?\nThe common treatments are oral iron supplements (taken by mouth) and intravenous iron preparations (given through a vein). Oral iron supplements are typically the first line of treatment, but intravenous iron preparations may be used in cases where oral iron is not effective or tolerated.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We aimed to find out whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing hemoglobin levels, reducing anemia, and improving pregnancy outcomes.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing intravenous iron to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 3939 people with iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. The studies were mainly conducted in India and Africa. Intravenous iron probably slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hemoglobin levels after birth may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on severe anemia after birth is very uncertain. Intravenous iron seems to make little to no difference in the risk of serious bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by differences in the people studied and how the treatments were given, very small study sizes, and poor reporting of results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, concise, and factually accurate. However, it requires revision because the main results section omits important findings about the potential harms and unwanted effects of the treatments. This gives the reader an incomplete picture of the evidence. Addressing this and two other minor points will significantly improve the summary.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Add Missing Information on Unwanted Effects to the Results Section**\n\nThe 'Key Messages' section mentions unwanted effects, but the main results section ('What did we find?') focuses only on the benefits and two specific risks (bleeding and transfusion). This is a critical omission, as readers need a balanced view of potential harms to make informed decisions. The abstract contains important safety information that should be summarized.\n\n*   **Problem:** The 'What did we find?' section lacks any mention of findings on adverse events, maternal mortality, severe infections, or hospital stays.\n*   **Suggestion:** Add a sentence to the end of the 'What did we find?' paragraph that summarizes these findings. For example:\n    > \"The evidence is very uncertain about the risk of serious unwanted effects like maternal mortality. There was likely little to no difference between the treatments for other unwanted effects like severe infections or prolonged hospital stays.\"\n\n**2. Use More Active Voice to Improve Clarity**\n\nThe summary sometimes uses passive voice, which can make sentences less direct. The style guide recommends using active voice ('We did X') instead of passive voice ('X was done').\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The studies were mainly conducted in India and Africa.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** It's slightly less direct and engaging than the active voice.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Researchers conducted the studies mainly in India and Africa.\"\n\n**3. Make the 'Limitations' Section More Specific**\n\nThe current limitations section is a bit vague. The source material mentions a specific limitation—'possible lack of blinding'—that is important and can be explained in simple terms.\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by differences in the people studied and how the treatments were given, very small study sizes, and poor reporting of results.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** It omits the key limitation that in some studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n    > \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because of differences in the people studied and how treatments were given. Also, some studies were very small, and in some cases, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which may have affected the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling into the best quartile. Readability scores and sentence length are excellent (P25). However, the analysis supports the need for minor revisions, as the passive voice count is in the upper quartile (18 instances, P75), indicating an opportunity to make the text more direct and active, in line with Cochrane style guidance."
