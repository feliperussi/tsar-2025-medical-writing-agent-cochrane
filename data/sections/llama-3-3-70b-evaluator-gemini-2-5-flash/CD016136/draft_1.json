In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia can occur due to the increased demand for iron to support the growth of the baby. If left untreated, iron deficiency anaemia can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby, including postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), the need for blood transfusion, and low birth weight.\n### What are the common treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\nThe common treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy are oral iron supplements, such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate, and intravenous iron preparations, such as iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, and ferumoxytol. Oral iron supplements are typically the first line of treatment, but intravenous iron preparations may be used in cases where oral iron is not effective or tolerated.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. They aimed to find out whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing haemoglobin levels, reducing anaemia, and improving pregnancy outcomes, such as postpartum haemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion. They also wanted to assess the safety of intravenous iron and its potential to cause adverse events, such as maternal mortality and morbidity.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing intravenous iron to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 3939 people with iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. The studies were mainly conducted in India and Africa. The gestational age at baseline ranged from 13 to 37 weeks, and Hb levels ranged from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most frequently compared preparations were intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate. Most RCTs were at low risk of bias. This Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding. Intravenous iron probably slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hemoglobin levels after birth may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on severe anemia after birth is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may make little to no difference in the risk of serious bleeding after birth, and blood transfusion rates are probably unaffected by the route of administration. Intravenous iron may cause little to no difference in maternal health, but the evidence is limited.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of participants and intervention delivery, very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns across several key metrics. The text's readability is considerably lower than desired, with `words_per_sentence` (26.73, P90), `flesch_kincaid_grade` (15.55, P90), and `flesch_reading_ease` (31.20, P10) all falling outside typical ranges, suggesting sentences are too long and complex. Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, as indicated by `smog_index` (15.85, BEYOND_P90), `complex_words_dc` (295.00, BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (163.00, BEYOND_P90), and `long_words` (219.00, BEYOND_P90), all of which are significantly higher than typical PLS texts. Furthermore, the `nouns` count (231.00, BEYOND_P90) is excessively high, contributing to a noun-heavy and less engaging style. While `passive_voice` (18.00, P75) is at the higher end of the typical range, it still presents opportunities for improvement. These deviations confirm the need for substantial revisions to improve clarity and readability for the target audience."
