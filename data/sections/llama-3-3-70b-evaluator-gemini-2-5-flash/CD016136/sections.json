  "plain_title": "Is intravenous iron (given through a vein) better than oral iron (taken by mouth) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women?",
  "key_messages": [
    "In pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron (given through a vein) likely slightly increases hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) levels and reduces anemia compared to oral iron (the text appears truncated)",
    "The current evidence does not clearly show whether intravenous iron increases or decreases the risk of unwanted effects such as severe infections, prolonged hospital stays, or admissions to intensive care units, and more research is needed to understand its safety and effectiveness fully.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of intravenous versus oral iron, focus on outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as the impact on maternal and infant health, and improve the reporting of adverse events to provide clearer guidance for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy."

      "subheading": "What is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?",
      "content": "Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of haemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to different parts of the body. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia can occur due to the increased demand for iron to support the growth of the baby. If left untreated, iron deficiency anaemia can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby, including postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), the need for blood transfusion, and low birth weight."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?",
      "content": "The common treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy are oral iron supplements, such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate, and intravenous iron preparations, such as iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, and ferumoxytol. Oral iron supplements are typically the first line of treatment, but intravenous iron preparations may be used in cases where oral iron is not effective or tolerated."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. They aimed to find out whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing haemoglobin levels, reducing anaemia, and improving pregnancy outcomes, such as postpartum haemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion. They also wanted to assess the safety of intravenous iron and its potential to cause adverse events, such as maternal mortality and morbidity."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 13 studies that involved 3939 people with iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. The studies were mainly conducted in India and Africa. The gestational age at baseline ranged from 13 to 37 weeks, and Hb levels ranged from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most frequently compared preparations were intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate. Most RCTs were at low risk of bias. This Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding. Intravenous iron probably slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hemoglobin levels after birth may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on severe anemia after birth is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may make little to no difference in the risk of serious bleeding after birth, and blood transfusion rates are probably unaffected by the route of administration. Intravenous iron may cause little to no difference in maternal health, but the evidence is limited."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of participants and intervention delivery, very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants aware of treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes.",
