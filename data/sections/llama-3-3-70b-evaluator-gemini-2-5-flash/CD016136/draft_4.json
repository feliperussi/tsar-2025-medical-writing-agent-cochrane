  "draft": "Is intravenous iron (given through a vein) better than oral iron (taken by mouth) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that intravenous iron likely slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnant women compared to oral iron.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether intravenous iron increases or decreases the risk of unwanted effects such as severe infections, prolonged hospital stays, or admissions to intensive care units.\n- Future research should look at the long-term effects of both treatments, focus on results that matter most to mothers and babies, and clearly report any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy?\nIron deficiency anemia is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of hemoglobin (a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen). In pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia can occur due to the increased demand for iron to support the growth of the baby. If left untreated, iron deficiency anemia can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy?\nThe common treatments are oral iron supplements (taken by mouth) and intravenous iron preparations (given through a vein). Oral iron supplements are typically the first line of treatment, but intravenous iron preparations may be used in cases where oral iron is not effective or tolerated.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. They aimed to find out whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing hemoglobin levels, reducing anemia, and improving pregnancy outcomes.\n\nWhat methods did the researchers use?\nWe searched for studies comparing intravenous iron to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the researchers find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 3939 people with iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. The studies were mainly conducted in India and Africa. Intravenous iron probably slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hemoglobin levels after birth may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on severe anemia after birth is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by differences in the people studied and how the treatments were given, very small study sizes, and poor reporting of results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. All critical checks have passed. However, a few key improvements are needed to make the summary more consistent and complete for patients and caregivers. I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' to ensure these important changes are made.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add Missing Key Safety Results:** The results section summarizes the benefits of IV iron but omits important findings about risks that would matter to a pregnant woman. The original review found little to no difference in serious bleeding after birth or the need for blood transfusions, which is reassuring information that should be included.\n    - **Problematic Section:** The end of the \"What did the researchers find?\" section.\n    - **Suggested Addition:** After the sentence \"...the effect on severe anemia after birth is very uncertain,\" please add a sentence like: \"Intravenous iron seems to make little to no difference in the risk of serious bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion.\"\n\n2. **Make the Point of View Consistent:** The summary inconsistently switches between talking about \"the researchers\" in the third person and using \"we\" to describe the review authors' work. The Cochrane style is to consistently use \"we\" to build trust and clarity.\n    - **Problematic Quotes:** \"What did the researchers want to find out? The researchers wanted to evaluate...\", \"What methods did the researchers use?\", \"What did the researchers find?\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** Change these to use the first person. For example: \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to evaluate...\", \"What methods did we use?\", and \"What did we find?\"\n\n3. **Define Technical Terms Immediately:** The term \"hemoglobin\" is used in the first Key Message but isn't defined until a later section. Readers who only scan the key messages will miss the definition.\n    - **Problematic Quote:** \"- We found that intravenous iron likely slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnant women compared to oral iron.\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** Add a brief, parenthetical definition right away, as was done in the source material: \"- We found that intravenous iron likely slightly increases hemoglobin levels (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and reduces anemia in pregnant women compared to oral iron.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. The readability scores are excellent. However, the analysis also shows that the use of passive voice (18 instances, P75) and the total noun count (148, P75) are in the upper range of what is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial feedback to use more direct, active language (e.g., 'we found' instead of third-person phrasing) to further improve clarity."
