  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time.\n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It likely reduces the risk of severe pain and means women need less pain relief medication (local anesthetic).\n- The evidence is of moderate quality. This means we are reasonably confident in this finding, but future research could change the results.\n- Future studies should use more consistent methods and medicines. They should also focus on results that matter most to patients and doctors, like satisfaction with pain relief and the baby's health.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves putting pain relief medicine (local anesthetic) into a small space in your back, near the spine. This helps block pain signals from your belly, pelvis, and the area between the vagina and back passage (the perineum), providing effective pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be given through different methods, including continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labor. A key concern is 'breakthrough pain', which is severe pain that happens even when you are getting pain relief. When this occurs, an anesthesiologist needs to provide extra treatment. Knowing the pros and cons of each method helps doctors give the best pain relief and improve the health of mothers and babies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus continuous infusion for epidural analgesia?\nWe wanted to find out which method was better for pain relief during labor: giving the medicine in timed doses (automated mandatory bolus) or as a steady flow (continuous infusion).\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with continuous infusion for labor epidural analgesia. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the risk of severe pain and probably reduces the amount of local anesthetic (pain relief medication) used compared to continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, this method probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of cesarean delivery (delivery by surgery) or instrumental delivery (a delivery that requires tools like forceps or a vacuum device), or the duration of labor analgesia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because some studies were small, and they differed in the types of patients included and how they gave the treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revision to improve clarity for a patient audience. The language is more complex and abstract than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which is making it harder to read. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs to make sentences more direct.** The analysis shows a high number of nominalizations (verbs turned into nouns). This makes the text feel formal and less clear.\n   - **Example:** '...this method probably makes little to no difference to the **incidence** of cesarean delivery... or the **duration** of labor analgesia.'\n   - **Problem:** 'Incidence' and 'duration' are abstract nouns. It's clearer to state what does or doesn't happen.\n   - **Suggestion:** '...this method probably does not change **how often** women have a cesarean delivery... It also likely does not change **how long** labor pain relief lasts.'\n\n2. **Simplify complex medical vocabulary.** The summary contains many long, multi-syllable words that can be replaced with simpler alternatives. This is supported by the high `complex_words` and `smog_index` scores.\n   - **Example:** 'When this occurs, an **anesthesiologist** needs to provide extra treatment.'\n   - **Problem:** 'Occurs' is formal and 'anesthesiologist' is a long, technical term that may be unfamiliar.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'When this **happens**, a **specialist doctor** needs to give extra treatment.'\n\n3. **Remove technical jargon, even when it is defined.** If a plain language explanation is clear enough on its own, the technical term is often unnecessary and can intimidate readers.\n   - **Example:** '...block pain signals from your belly, pelvis, and the area between the vagina and back passage (the **perineum**)...'\n   - **Problem:** The plain language description is excellent. Adding the clinical term 'perineum' adds complexity without adding value for the reader.\n   - **Suggestion:** Simply write: '...block pain signals from your belly, pelvis, and the area between the vagina and back passage.'\n\nAddressing these patterns of complex vocabulary and sentence structure will make the summary much easier for patients to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and active voice are good, six key metrics related to vocabulary complexity and sentence structure deviate significantly from the norm (P90). These include high counts of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words (7+ characters). This pattern suggests the text's vocabulary is more technical and its sentences more abstract than a typical PLS."
