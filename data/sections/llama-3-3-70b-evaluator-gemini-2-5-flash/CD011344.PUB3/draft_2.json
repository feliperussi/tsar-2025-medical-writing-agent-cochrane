  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time. \n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and reduced local anaesthetic consumption.\n- The quality of the evidence is moderate. While there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive. More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies. This includes variation in techniques and medications used, and prioritizing outcomes important to patients and healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves administering local anaesthetics (pain relief medications) into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing effective pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labor. Breakthrough pain, which requires additional medical intervention, is a significant concern. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion is essential for optimizing epidural analgesia and improving maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the benefits and harms of automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia during labor. They sought to determine which method is more effective in reducing breakthrough pain, the incidence of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, and other relevant outcomes.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for labor epidural analgesia. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the amount of local anaesthetic used compared to basal infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, it probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the duration of labor analgesia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sample sizes and heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the interventions were delivered. This reduces confidence in the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs significant revision to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The language is often too technical and academic, making it difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Replace passive, academic phrases with simpler, active language.**\nThe text often uses passive voice and clinical terms that create distance from the reader. Rephrasing these sentences to be more direct will make the summary much easier to follow.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"It is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and reduced local anaesthetic consumption.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"Is associated with,\" \"incidence,\" and \"consumption\" are formal, scientific terms. This phrasing is indirect and less clear for patients.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This method likely leads to fewer episodes of severe pain and means women need less pain relief medication.\"\n\n**2. Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.**\nSeveral sentences are long and built around abstract nouns, which makes them dense and hard to process. Breaking them down and using more verbs will improve clarity.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion is essential for optimizing epidural analgesia and improving maternal and fetal outcomes.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This 28-word sentence is packed with abstract concepts like \"understanding,\" \"advantages,\" \"optimization,\" and \"outcomes.\" It's a lot for a reader to unpack at once.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"It's important to know the pros and cons of each method to provide the best pain relief and improve the health of mothers and babies.\"\n\n**3. Remove or explain technical jargon.**\nThe summary still contains technical terms that will be unfamiliar to most readers. These should be replaced with everyday language or clearly explained.\n\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by small study sample sizes and heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the interventions were delivered.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"Heterogeneity\" is high-level jargon. The phrase \"the ways the interventions were delivered\" is also unnecessarily wordy.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have less confidence in the evidence because some studies were small, and they differed in the types of patients included and how they gave the treatments.\"\n\nBy addressing these key areas, the summary will become much more accessible and useful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that the draft deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. While sentence length and active voice are good, the text scores poorly on key readability metrics. The Flesch Reading Ease score is very low (23.32), and the SMOG Index is very high (16.19), indicating the text is difficult to read. This is driven by a high number of complex and long words (BEYOND_P90), excessive use of passive voice (BEYOND_P90), and a high density of nouns and nominalizations (P90). These metrics confirm the editorial judgment that the vocabulary and sentence structures are too academic for a lay audience."
