  "draft": "# Is automated mandatory bolus (a way of giving pain relief medication at set time intervals) better than continuous infusion (giving medication all the time) for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia (a type of pain relief given through a tube in the back)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Automated mandatory bolus (a way of giving pain relief medication at set time intervals) may be better than continuous infusion (giving medication all the time) for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia (a type of pain relief given through a tube in the back), as it is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain (pain that is not well-controlled) and reduced local anaesthetic (pain relief medication) consumption, but there is no significant difference in the incidence of caesarean delivery (delivery by surgery) or instrumental delivery (delivery using tools like forceps).\n- The quality of the evidence is moderate, meaning that while there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects, particularly in terms of long-term outcomes and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the variation in techniques and medications used, and should prioritize outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as maternal satisfaction (how happy mothers are with their care) and the well-being of babies, to provide more definitive answers to the question of whether automated mandatory bolus is better than continuous infusion for pain relief during labor.\n**Introduction**\n### What is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labour?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labour and childbirth. It involves administering local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine, and sometimes opioids, like fentanyl, into the epidural space around the spine. This helps to block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing effective pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including continuous infusion (basal infusion) or automated mandatory bolus (AMB), where medications are injected at set time intervals. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) allows patients to self-administer additional boluses of medication as needed. Effective pain management during labour is crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the baby.\n### What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labour. Breakthrough pain, which requires additional medical intervention, is a significant concern. Moreover, the method of epidural analgesia administration may influence the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, and other outcomes such as the duration of labour and the consumption of local anaesthetics. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of AMB versus basal infusion is essential for optimizing epidural analgesia and improving maternal and fetal outcomes.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the benefits and harms of automated mandatory bolus (AMB) with basal infusion (BI) for maintaining epidural analgesia during labour. They sought to determine which method is more effective in reducing breakthrough pain, the incidence of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, and other relevant outcomes such as local anaesthetic consumption and maternal satisfaction. By assessing the current evidence, the authors aimed to provide guidance on the most effective approach to epidural analgesia administration, ultimately contributing to better pain management and outcomes for women in labour.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for labour epidural analgesia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with different techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia, including combined spinal epidural and epidural only. The population characteristics included healthy nulliparous women and healthy nulli- and multiparous women, with all studies excluding women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The types of interventions and comparisons included automated mandatory bolus (AMB) versus basal infusion (BI) for maintaining labour epidural analgesia. The studies lasted for varying durations, but the exact length of the studies was not specified. There was no overview of study funding sources provided. The interventions used different types of analgesics, including ropivacaine with fentanyl, ropivacaine with sufentanil, levobupivacaine with sufentanil, levobupivacaine with fentanyl, and bupivacaine with fentanyl. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the amount of local anaesthetic used compared to basal infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. Automated mandatory bolus probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the duration of labour analgesia.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the interventions were delivered, which reduces confidence in the findings.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

Several subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which violates the style guide. The text is consistently difficult to read, characterized by overly long and complex sentences, excessive passive voice, frequent nominalization, and a high density of complex and long words. These issues are particularly problematic in the 'Key Messages' section, which should be easily digestible. The extensive use of parenthetical definitions, while sometimes necessary, often makes sentences cumbersome and redundant, especially when terms are defined multiple times.",

All other readability indices (ARI, CLI, GFI, LIX, RIX, SMOG, Dale-Chall) are also beyond typical ranges, confirming severe readability issues. \\n- **Sentence Structure:** Words per sentence (26.03, P90) is too high, and passive voice (40.00, BEYOND_P90) is excessively used, contributing to complexity. \\n- **Vocabulary Complexity:** There is an overwhelming number of complex words (264.00, BEYOND_P90), long words (338.00, BEYOND_P90), and unfamiliar words (complex_words_dc: 426.00, BEYOND_P90).
