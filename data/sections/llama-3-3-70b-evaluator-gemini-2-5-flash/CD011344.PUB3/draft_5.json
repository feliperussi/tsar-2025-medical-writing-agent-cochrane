  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time.\n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It likely leads to fewer episodes of severe pain and means women need less pain relief medication.\n- The quality of the evidence is moderate. This means that while research suggests automated mandatory bolus may be better, we are not certain. More research is needed before we can be sure of its effects.\n- Future studies should use more consistent methods and medicines. They should also focus on results that matter most to patients and doctors, like satisfaction with pain relief and the baby's health.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves putting pain relief medicine into a small space in your back, near the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing effective pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be given through different methods, including continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labor. A key concern is 'breakthrough pain', which is severe pain that happens even when you are getting pain relief. When this occurs, an anesthesiologist needs to provide extra treatment. Knowing the pros and cons of each method helps doctors give the best pain relief and improve the health of mothers and babies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus continuous infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the benefits and harms of automated mandatory bolus with continuous infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia during labor. They sought to determine which method is more effective in reducing severe pain, the incidence of cesarean and instrumental deliveries, and other relevant outcomes.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with continuous infusion for labor epidural analgesia. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of severe pain and probably reduces the amount of local anesthetic used compared to continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, it probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of cesarean delivery (birth by surgery), instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or a vacuum device), or the duration of labor analgesia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because some studies were small, and they differed in the types of patients included and how they gave the treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

The main issues are the use of technical vocabulary without clear explanations and complex, noun-heavy sentences that make the text difficult to follow. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing high scores for complex words, long words, and nominalizations (turning verbs into nouns). By simplifying key terms and making sentences more direct, you can make this summary much more accessible for patients and the public. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with good sentence length and use of pronouns. However, the draft deviates significantly from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Seven metrics are in the P90 range, including `smog_index` (14.9), `complex_words` (133), `long_words` (183), `nominalization` (22), and `passive_voice` (19). This indicates the text is more complex and less direct than a typical PLS, supporting the need for simplification of vocabulary and sentence construction."
