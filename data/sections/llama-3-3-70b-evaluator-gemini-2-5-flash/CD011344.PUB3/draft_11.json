It involves administering local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine, and sometimes opioids, like fentanyl, into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing significant pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including basal infusion (BI), where medication is given continuously, and automated mandatory bolus (AMB), where medication is injected at set time intervals. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) allows patients to self-administer additional doses of medication as needed. Effective pain management during labour is crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the baby.\n### What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice between automated mandatory bolus (AMB) and basal infusion (BI) for epidural analgesia can impact the effectiveness of pain relief and the incidence of side effects. AMB may offer more consistent pain relief by providing medication at regular intervals, potentially reducing the need for additional interventions by anaesthesiologists. However, the optimal method might depend on various factors, including the type of analgesics used, the technique for initiating epidural analgesia (e.g., combined spinal-epidural), and individual patient characteristics. Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each method is essential for improving labour pain management.\n### What did the review authors aim to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors sought to compare the effectiveness and safety of automated mandatory bolus (AMB) with basal infusion (BI) for maintaining epidural analgesia during labour. Specifically, they aimed to assess how these methods impact the incidence of breakthrough pain, the need for anaesthesiologist interventions, and the occurrence of adverse effects such as caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, and complications related to the epidural procedure itself. By evaluating existing research, the authors hoped to provide evidence-based guidance on the most effective approach to epidural analgesia for labour pain management.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus and basal infusion for epidural analgesia in labor, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with different techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia, including combined spinal epidural and epidural only. The population characteristics included healthy nulliparous women and healthy nulli- and multiparous women, with no studies including women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The types of interventions and comparisons included automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia. No information was available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anaesthetics compared to basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia in women at term. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, automated mandatory bolus probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labour analgesia, and neonatal Apgar scores.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment allocation, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
