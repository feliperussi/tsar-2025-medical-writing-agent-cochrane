  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time.\n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It likely reduces the risk of severe pain and means women need less pain relief medication.\n- The evidence is of moderate quality. This means we are reasonably confident in this finding, but future research could change the results.\n- Future studies should use more consistent methods and medicines. They should also focus on results that matter most to patients and doctors, like satisfaction with pain relief and the baby's health.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves putting pain relief medicine into a small space in your back, near the spine. This helps block pain signals from your belly, pelvis, and the area between the vagina and back passage, providing effective pain relief. \n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labor. A key concern is 'breakthrough pain', which is severe pain that happens even when you are getting pain relief. When this happens, a specialist doctor needs to give extra treatment. Knowing the pros and cons of each method helps doctors give the best pain relief and improve the health of mothers and babies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus continuous infusion for epidural analgesia?\nWe wanted to find out which method was better for pain relief during labor: giving the medicine in timed doses or as a steady flow.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with continuous infusion for labor epidural analgesia. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the risk of severe pain and probably reduces the amount of pain relief medication used compared to continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, this method probably does not change how often women have a cesarean delivery or how long labor pain relief lasts.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because some studies were small, and they differed in the types of patients included and how they gave the treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
