  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time.\n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It likely leads to fewer episodes of severe pain and means women need less pain relief medication.\n- The quality of the evidence is moderate. While there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive. More research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies. This includes variation in techniques and medications used, and prioritizing outcomes important to patients and healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves administering local anaesthetics (pain relief medications) into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing effective pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labor. Breakthrough pain, which requires additional medical intervention, is a significant concern. It's essential to know the pros and cons of each method to provide the best pain relief and improve the health of mothers and babies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the benefits and harms of automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia during labor. They sought to determine which method is more effective in reducing breakthrough pain, the incidence of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, and other relevant outcomes.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for labor epidural analgesia. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the amount of local anaesthetic used compared to basal infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, it probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the duration of labor analgesia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because some studies were small, and they differed in the types of patients included and how they gave the treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The language is often too technical and the sentence structures are complex, which could make it difficult for patients to understand the key messages.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Words and Phrases**\n\nSome sentences use formal, clinical language that can be replaced with simpler, everyday words. This will make the text more accessible.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"It involves administering local anaesthetics (pain relief medications) into the epidural space around the spine.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The word \"administering\" is formal and less common than simpler alternatives.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This involves putting pain relief medicine (called local anaesthetics) into a small space in your back, near the spine.\"\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Breakthrough pain, which requires additional medical intervention, is a significant concern.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** \"Additional medical intervention\" and \"significant concern\" are technical and vague.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"A key concern is 'breakthrough pain', which is severe pain that happens even when you are getting pain relief. When this occurs, an anaesthesiologist needs to provide extra treatment.\"\n\n**2. Use Consistent and Simple Terminology**\n\nThe summary uses two different terms for the same method, which will confuse readers. It's important to choose the clearest term and use it consistently.\n\n- **Problematic phrases:** The text introduces \"continuous infusion\" in the first paragraph, but later switches to \"basal infusion\" in the Aims and Results sections (e.g., \"...automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion...\").\n- **Why it's an issue:** Readers may think \"basal infusion\" is a different method they haven't learned about.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Please replace all instances of \"basal infusion\" with \"continuous infusion\". This term is more descriptive and was explained at the beginning.\n\n**3. Use More Active and Direct Language**\n\nThe draft often uses passive voice and noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations), which can make the text feel indirect and harder to read. Using active verbs makes the writing clearer and more engaging.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This is written in the passive voice. It's clearer to state who is performing the action.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Doctors can provide epidural pain relief using different methods, such as continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\"\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The quality of the evidence is moderate. While there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is abstract. Rewording it more directly helps the reader understand the takeaway message.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We rated the evidence as 'moderate'. This means that while research suggests automated mandatory bolus may be better, we are not certain. More research is needed before we can be sure of its effects.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like sentence length are good (P25), the draft deviates significantly in key areas related to readability and complexity. The SMOG index (15.5) and count of complex words (147) are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more difficult than a typical PLS. Additionally, high rates of passive voice, nominalizations, and long words contribute to a low Flesch Reading Ease score (31.0), confirming that the text would be challenging for a lay audience."
