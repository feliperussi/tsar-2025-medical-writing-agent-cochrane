  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time.\n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It likely leads to fewer episodes of severe pain and means women need less pain relief medication.\n- The quality of the evidence is moderate. This means that while research suggests automated mandatory bolus may be better, we are not certain. More research is needed before we can be sure of its effects.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the variation in techniques and medications used, and should prioritize outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves putting pain relief medicine into a small space in your back, near the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing effective pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be given through different methods, including continuous infusion or automated mandatory bolus.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice of epidural analgesia method can impact the quality of pain relief, the risk of complications, and the overall experience of labor. A key concern is 'breakthrough pain', which is severe pain that happens even when you are getting pain relief. When this occurs, an anesthesiologist needs to provide extra treatment. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of automated mandatory bolus versus continuous infusion is essential for optimizing epidural analgesia and improving maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus continuous infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors aimed to compare the benefits and harms of automated mandatory bolus with continuous infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia during labor. They sought to determine which method is more effective in reducing severe pain, the incidence of cesarean and instrumental deliveries, and other relevant outcomes.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with continuous infusion for labor epidural analgesia. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of severe pain and probably reduces the amount of local anesthetic used compared to continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, it probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of cesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the duration of labor analgesia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because some studies were small, and they differed in the types of patients included and how they gave the treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness and factual accuracy. However, it is not yet ready for publication because the language is too complex for a lay audience. The feedback below focuses on the top 3 areas for improvement to make the summary clearer and more accessible for patients and their families.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify Complex and Academic Vocabulary**\n\nMany sentences use multi-syllable, academic words where simpler, everyday words would be clearer. This makes the text difficult to read and understand.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the variation in techniques and medications used, and should prioritize outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Words like 'addressing limitations', 'variation', 'prioritize', and 'healthcare providers' are jargon-heavy and create a high cognitive load for the reader.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should use more consistent methods and medicines. They should also focus on results that matter most to patients and doctors, like satisfaction with pain relief and the baby's health.\"\n\n**2. Explain Medical Terms in Context**\n\nThe results section uses medical terms without the simple, parenthetical explanations that would help a lay reader understand them immediately.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"However, it probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of cesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the duration of labor analgesia.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** While many people know \"cesarean delivery,\" the term \"instrumental delivery\" is less common and could be confusing. Providing a quick definition removes ambiguity.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, it probably makes little to no difference to the rate of cesarean delivery (birth by surgery), instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or a vacuum device), or how long the pain relief lasted.\"\n\n**3. Replace Abstract, Noun-Heavy Phrases with Direct Verbs**\n\nSome sentences are built around abstract nouns instead of clear actions, which makes them feel dense and less direct.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of automated mandatory bolus versus continuous infusion is essential for optimizing epidural analgesia and improving maternal and fetal outcomes.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and abstract. Using simpler verbs makes the point more directly and is easier to follow.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Knowing the pros and cons of each method helps doctors give the best pain relief and improve the health of mothers and babies.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nThese editorial suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis. The draft's Flesch Reading Ease score is very low (30.95), and several complexity metrics are far outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary. Specifically, the SMOG Index (15.65) and the count of complex words (150) are rated 'Beyond P90', confirming that the vocabulary is a significant barrier to readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in readability and vocabulary complexity. The Flesch Reading Ease score (30.95) is in the lowest decile (P10), indicating the text is very difficult to read. This is driven by metrics rated 'Beyond P90', including the SMOG Index (15.65) and the number of complex words (150), which are substantially higher than is typical for this text type. Additionally, metrics for passive voice, nominalizations, and long words are in the P90 range, contributing to the overall complexity."
