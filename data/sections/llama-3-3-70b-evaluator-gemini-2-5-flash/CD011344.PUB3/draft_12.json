  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time. \n\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and reduced use of local anesthetics. However, there is no significant difference in the incidence of caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Maternal satisfaction may be improved with automated mandatory bolus, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. More research is needed to understand the effects of automated mandatory bolus on maternal satisfaction and other important outcomes.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion on important outcomes like caesarean delivery and instrumental delivery. It should include larger numbers of people to give more reliable results, as the current evidence is not strong enough to fully answer the question of which method is better.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves administering local anesthetics (medications that numb the area) and sometimes opioids (strong pain relievers) into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing significant pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including basal infusion (where medication is given continuously) and automated mandatory bolus (where medication is injected at set time intervals). \n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice between automated mandatory bolus and basal infusion for epidural analgesia can impact the effectiveness of pain relief and the incidence of side effects. Automated mandatory bolus may offer more consistent pain relief by providing medication at regular intervals, potentially reducing the need for additional interventions by anesthesiologists. However, the optimal method might depend on various factors, including the type of anesthetics used, the technique for initiating epidural analgesia, and individual patient characteristics.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors sought to compare the effectiveness and safety of automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia during labor. They aimed to assess how these methods impact the incidence of breakthrough pain, the need for anesthesiologist interventions, and the occurrence of adverse effects such as caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, and complications related to the epidural procedure itself.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with different techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia. Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anesthetics compared to basal infusion for maintaining labor epidural analgesia in women at term. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, automated mandatory bolus probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labor analgesia, and neonatal Apgar scores.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment allocation, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check because it is missing the required 'Methods' section. Additionally, the language is too complex and academic for a lay audience, making it difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify Complex Language and Define Jargon Immediately.** The text is filled with technical terms that are not explained clearly or quickly enough for a reader. The key messages, in particular, should be simplified.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and reduced use of local anesthetics.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence uses multiple technical terms ('associated with', 'incidence', 'breakthrough pain', 'local anesthetics') without immediate, simple definitions. This makes the main findings hard to grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This method seems to lead to less 'breakthrough pain' (pain that isn’t controlled by the medication) and requires less numbing medicine (local anesthetics).\"\n\n2. **Convert Passive Sentences to Active Voice.** The draft frequently uses the passive voice, which can make the text feel impersonal and harder to follow. The style guide requires active voice (e.g., 'we found' instead of 'it was found').\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Maternal satisfaction may be improved with automated mandatory bolus, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The passive construction ('may be improved') is less direct and engaging than the active voice.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Automated mandatory bolus may improve how satisfied mothers are with their care, but we are not certain about this evidence.\"\n\n3. **Replace Abstract Nouns (Nominalizations) with Verbs.** The text relies heavily on noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences more abstract and wordy. Using direct verbs makes the writing clearer and more concise.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anesthetics...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Incidence' and 'consumption' are noun forms. Using verbs instead makes the sentence more direct and easier to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces how often breakthrough pain occurs and lowers the amount of local anesthetic used each hour...\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft's readability is at a university level (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 16.4) and it contains an extremely high number of passive sentences and complex words, deviating significantly from typical Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 15 of 18 metrics falling outside the expected range. All readability scores indicate very high complexity (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 16.38, Gunning Fog Index of 20.93), placing them in the 'BEYOND_P90' category. The draft also has an extremely high number of passive voice constructions (31), nominalizations (30), and complex words (201), all rated 'BEYOND_P90'. These results confirm that the text is too academic and structurally complex for the intended audience."
