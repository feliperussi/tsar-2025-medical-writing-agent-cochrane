  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive stent-graft with holes better than open surgery or no surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if a minimally invasive stent-graft with holes is better than open surgery or no surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. \nThe lack of robust evidence in this area is due to the low incidence rates of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and the heterogeneity of the aneurysms themselves, making it difficult to conduct research and draw firm conclusions. \nFuture studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible, which would help to better understand the benefits and harms of different treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulge in the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulge can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. When an AAA is close to or next to the renal arteries, it can be more difficult to repair, and the optimum treatment for these complex AAAs is unknown.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms?\nOne option for treating complex AAAs is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which involves using a special type of graft with holes or scallops to allow blood to flow to the visceral arteries. Another option is open surgical repair (OSR), which involves surgically removing the aneurysm and replacing it with a graft. Conservative management, or non-operative management, is also an option, but it may not be suitable for all patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR compared to OSR or conservative management for people with complex AAAs. They aimed to find out which treatment is most effective in reducing mortality, improving quality of life, and minimizing adverse events, and to determine the best approach for managing complex AAAs.\n\nWhat did the researchers do?\nWe searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, summarized their results, and evaluated the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these treatments.\n\nWhat did the researchers find?\nWe found no studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because there are too few studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, it is not approved because several key sentences are too complex for a lay audience, which could prevent readers from understanding important information. The top 3 improvements needed are: \n\n1. **Simplify the key message about future research.** The current sentence is too long and uses technical jargon. \n- **Problem:** 'Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating ...' \n- **Suggestion:** 'To get better evidence, future research should be set up in a way that requires patients to be included in studies. This would help us learn more about the best ways to treat these aneurysms.'\n\n2. **Explain the medical term 'visceral arteries'.** This term is used without explanation, leaving the reader to guess its meaning.\n- **Problem:** '...a special type of graft with holes or scallops to allow blood to flow to the visceral arteries.'\n- **Suggestion:** '...a special tube (a graft) with small holes in it. These holes line up with the arteries that supply blood to important organs like the kidneys and intestines, allowing blood to keep flowing to them.'\n\n3. **Make the 'Limitations' section more direct.** The current text understates the key issue, which is that no studies were found.\n- **Problem:** 'The evidence is limited because there are too few studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.'\n- **Suggestion:** 'Because we found no suitable studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of these treatments. There is a lack of evidence in this area.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the expected ranges, with 61% in the best quartile for readability (e.g., low passive voice, high active voice) and the remaining 39% in the median range. This indicates a strong structural and stylistic foundation. However, these overall positive scores can mask isolated instances of complexity, such such as individual long sentences or specific undefined technical terms that still require editorial attention for clarity."
