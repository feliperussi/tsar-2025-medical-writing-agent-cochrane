This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. If left untreated, AAAs can rupture, leading to severe bleeding and even death. Common treatments for AAAs include open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair, which involves using a stent-graft to reinforce the aorta.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. They aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies that directly compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative management in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. The search covered publications from inception to the present and used keywords and MeSH terms related to \"fenestrated\", \"endovascular\", \"aneurysm\", \"open repair\", and \"conservative\".\n### Eligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies were randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, and case‑control studies that reported clinical outcomes for FEVAR versus OSR or conservative treatment in complex AAAs. We excluded case series with fewer than 10 patients, studies lacking a comparator group, and those not reporting mortality or major adverse events.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes such as peri‑operative mortality, re‑intervention rates, aneurysm‑related mortality, and major complications. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when appropriate, pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\n### Evidence Assessment\nThe body of evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Benefits (e.g., lower early mortality) and harms (e.g., higher re‑intervention) of FEVAR relative to OSR or conservative management were weighed to inform clinical recommendations.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Therefore, there are no characteristics of included studies to report. We did not identify eligible studies that compared treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms with fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair versus open surgical repair or conservative management. It is unclear if fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair has an effect on outcome.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Only 16.7% of features fall within the best quartile, while 44.4% are in the P90 range and 33.3% are beyond P90, indicating a high level of complexity and poor readability. Key metrics showing significant deviation include:\n-   **Readability Indices:** Flesch Reading Ease (31.12, P10), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.69, P90), Automated Readability Index (16.07, P90), Gunning Fog Index (20.63, P90), SMOG Index (16.38, BEYOND_P90), Dale-Chall Readability (8.20, P90), LIX (60.28, P90), and RIX (9.00, P90) all suggest the text is too difficult.\n-   **Sentence Structure:** Words per sentence (27.26, P90) is too high, and passive voice (24.00, BEYOND_P90) is excessively used.\n-   **Vocabulary Complexity:** Nominalization (25.00, P90), complex words (179.00, BEYOND_P90), complex words (Dale-Chall) (319.00, BEYOND_P90), and long words (243.00, BEYOND_P90) are all too high.\n-   **Plain Language Elements:** Nouns (212.00, BEYOND_P90) are too frequent, contributing to a dense style.\n\nThese deviations collectively point to a text that is not sufficiently clear or easy to read for a general audience."
