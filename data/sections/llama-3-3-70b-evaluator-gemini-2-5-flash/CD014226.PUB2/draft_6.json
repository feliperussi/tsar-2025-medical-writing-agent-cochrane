  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n\nKey messages:\n- We could not determine if fenestrated endovascular repair is better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- We did not find any studies that compared the benefits and harms of fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. They aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies that directly compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative management in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Therefore, there are no characteristics of included studies to report. We did not identify eligible studies that compared treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms with fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair versus open surgical repair or conservative management. It is unclear if fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair has an effect on outcome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is not approved due to a critical factual error and several areas needing improved clarity for a lay audience.\n\n**1. Critical Factual Error in Limitations:** The 'Limitations' section incorrectly discusses the quality of included studies when the review found no studies. This is a major contradiction that will confuse readers.\n- **Original:** 'The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.'\n- **Problem:** This contradicts the main finding that 'We found no studies'. You cannot comment on the sample size of studies that do not exist.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The main limitation is the complete lack of studies that met our criteria. Because we found no relevant studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to other treatments.'\n\n**2. Unclear Key Message:** The final key message uses technical language not suitable for patients.\n- **Original:** 'Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible.'\n- **Problem:** Phrases like 'commissioning agreements' and 'mandating patient inclusion' are jargon.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'To help find the best treatment, future research should be designed to make it easier for people with this condition to be included in studies.'\n\n**3. Repetitive Results Section:** The 'What did the review authors find?' section states the same finding three times, which is unnecessary.\n- **Original:** 'We found no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Therefore, there are no characteristics of included studies to report. We did not identify eligible studies that compared treatment...'\n- **Problem:** This is redundant and can be stated more concisely for better readability.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Our search did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no studies met our requirements, we cannot present any results.'\n\n**4. Undefined Technical Terms:** Key terms in the title and text are not explained in simple language.\n- **Original:** 'Is fenestrated endovascular repair better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?'\n- **Problem:** 'Fenestrated endovascular repair' is a complex term that needs a simple definition early on for readers to understand the topic.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** In the first section ('What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm...'), add a simple explanation: 'This review looks at a specific type of minimally invasive surgery called 'fenestrated' endovascular repair (FEVAR), which uses a custom tube (stent-graft) with small openings to maintain blood flow to important arteries near the bulge.'\n\nThe linguistic analysis shows high readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 13.2), which supports the need to simplify the technical language identified in these points.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good overall conformity with typical PLS statistical patterns, with all 18 metrics falling within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges. However, several readability indices, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (13.19) and SMOG Index (13.10), are in the P75 range, indicating the text is more complex than 75% of summaries in the corpus. This suggests that while sentence structure is generally good, the vocabulary and phrasing could be simplified to improve reader understanding, supporting the editorial feedback to revise jargon-heavy sentences."
