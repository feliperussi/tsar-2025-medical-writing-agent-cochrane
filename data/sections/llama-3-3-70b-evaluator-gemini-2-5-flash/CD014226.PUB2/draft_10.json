  "draft": "Fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms\n\nKey messages:\n- We found no studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive procedure using a stent-graft with holes to allow blood flow to nearby arteries) with open surgery or conservative management (monitoring the aneurysm without surgery) for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- To answer these important questions, researchers need to find better ways to include people with this condition in clinical trials.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. We wanted to see how FEVAR affected survival, length of hospital stay, and patients' quality of life.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries to find all relevant studies. We looked for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur search did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no studies met our requirements, we cannot present any results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is the complete lack of studies that met our criteria. Because we found no relevant studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to other treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The main title must be rephrased as a question to be more engaging for a patient audience. Additionally, the first key message is quite long and complex due to nested definitions, which could be simplified. Finally, there's a small redundancy in the results section that can be easily fixed to improve conciseness. Please see the detailed feedback for specific suggestions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges, indicating the text's statistical profile is similar to other Plain Language Summaries. For example, the average words per sentence (19.95) and readability scores are well within the typical range. While the metrics do not flag major issues, the editorial review identified specific style guide violations and clarity improvements that are detailed below."
