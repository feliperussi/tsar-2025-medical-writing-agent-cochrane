This bulge can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. When an AAA is close to or next to the renal arteries, it can be more difficult to repair, and the optimum treatment for these complex AAAs is unknown.\n### What are the common treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms?\nOne option for treating complex AAAs is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which involves using a special type of graft with holes or scallops to allow blood to flow to the visceral arteries. Another option is open surgical repair (OSR), which involves surgically removing the aneurysm and replacing it with a graft. Conservative management, or non-operative management, is also an option, but it may not be suitable for all patients.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR compared to OSR or conservative management for people with complex AAAs. They aimed to find out which treatment is most effective in reducing mortality, improving quality of life, and minimizing adverse events, and to determine the best approach for managing complex AAAs.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, summarized their results, and evaluated the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these treatments.\n**Results**\n### Reason for Interruption\nThe agent halted because it reached the maximum number of allowed iterations without completing its task. This limit is in place to prevent endless loops and excessive resource consumption.\n### Suggested Next Steps\nReview the prompt or the logic that caused the agent to loop. Simplify the task, add clearer termination conditions, or increase the iteration limit if appropriate. Then restart the agent with the revised instructions.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and there are too few studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The 'Results' section contains an internal agent error message instead of the review's findings, which is a critical factual error. Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the style guide. The text also suffers from overly long sentences and noun-heavy phrasing, making it difficult to understand. These issues are supported by linguistic metrics indicating high complexity and deviation from typical Plain Language Summary patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. While the word count is within limits, 11 out of 18 evaluated features fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 percentile ranges, indicating higher complexity than 90% of the corpus. Key deviations include: words_per_sentence (29.14, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (22.0, P90), nouns (160.0, P90), flesch_kincaid_grade (14.71, P90), automated_readability_index (15.31, P90), gunning_fog_index (19.63, P90), rix (8.52, P90), smog_index (14.18, P90), complex_words_dc (237.0, P90), complex_words (122.0, P90), and long_words (179.0, P90). These metrics collectively suggest the text is too difficult for the target audience, with sentences that are too long and vocabulary that is too complex and formal. The overall pattern conformity is rated as 'DEVIATES FROM TYPICAL PLS PATTERNS' with a 'Best Quartile Rate' of only 27.8%."
