  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive procedure using a stent-graft with holes to allow blood flow to nearby arteries) better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulge in the main blood vessel that can be life-threatening if it ruptures)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found no studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment. Therefore, we do not know if this procedure is better or worse for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- To answer these important questions, future research needs to be designed in a way that encourages more people to take part in studies.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. We wanted to see how FEVAR affected survival, length of hospital stay, and patients' quality of life.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries to find all relevant studies. We looked for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur search did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no studies met our requirements, we cannot present any results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is the complete lack of studies that met our criteria. Because we found no relevant studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to other treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a good start, but several clarity issues need to be addressed before approval. The main problems are an overly long title with nested definitions, inconsistent terminology for one of the comparison treatments ('no treatment' vs. 'conservative management'), and a key message about future research that is too vague. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability for patients.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Simplify the title by moving definitions into the text.** The current title is very long because it includes two full definitions in parentheses. This makes it hard to read and understand at a glance.\n    -   **Current Title:** \"Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive procedure using a stent-graft with holes to allow blood flow to nearby arteries) better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulge in the main blood vessel that can be life-threatening if it ruptures)?\"\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        -   **Title:** \"Fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms\"\n        -   Then, ensure the definitions are clearly stated in the first few paragraphs of the summary, which this draft does well.\n\n2.  **Use consistent and clear terms for the treatments being compared.** The summary uses 'no treatment' in the key messages and methods section, but then introduces 'conservative management' in the aims section without explaining what it means. This could confuse readers.\n    -   **Problematic Sentences:**\n        -   \"We found no studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or **no treatment**.\"\n        -   \"We wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or **conservative management**.\"\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite:** Choose one clear term and use it consistently. If using 'conservative management', define it simply.\n        -   For example: \"...compared to open surgical repair or conservative management (monitoring the aneurysm without surgery).\" Then use \"conservative management\" throughout.\n        -   Alternatively, consistently use a plainer phrase like \"monitoring without surgery\" or \"no surgery\".\n\n3.  **Make the second key message more specific.** The current message about future research is vague and doesn't give the reader a clear idea of what needs to happen.\n    -   **Current Message:** \"To answer these important questions, future research needs to be designed in a way that encourages more people to take part in studies.\"\n    -   **Suggested Rewrite (based on the abstract's conclusion):** \"To answer these important questions, researchers need to find better ways to include people with this condition in clinical trials.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.16) and Words per Sentence (19.43) are excellent, indicating the text is structurally simple and uses short sentences. However, these metrics do not capture the qualitative issues identified, such as the overly complex title structure and inconsistent terminology, which are the primary barriers to reader understanding in this draft."
