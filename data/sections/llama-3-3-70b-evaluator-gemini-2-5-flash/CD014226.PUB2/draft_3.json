  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive stent-graft with holes better than open surgery or no surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if a minimally invasive stent-graft with holes is better than open surgery or no surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. The lack of robust evidence in this area is due to the low incidence rates of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and the heterogeneity of the aneurysms themselves, making it difficult to conduct research and draw firm conclusions. To get better evidence, future research should be set up in a way that requires patients to be included in studies. This would help us learn more about the best ways to treat these aneurysms.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulge in the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulge can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. When an AAA is close to or next to the renal arteries, it can be more difficult to repair, and the optimum treatment for these complex AAAs is unknown.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms?\nOne option for treating complex AAAs is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which involves using a special tube (a graft) with small holes in it. These holes line up with the arteries that supply blood to important organs like the kidneys and intestines, allowing blood to keep flowing to them. Another option is open surgical repair (OSR), which involves surgically removing the aneurysm and replacing it with a graft. Conservative management, or non-operative management, is also an option, but it may not be suitable for all patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR compared to OSR or conservative management for people with complex AAAs. They aimed to find out which treatment is most effective in reducing mortality, improving quality of life, and minimizing adverse events, and to determine the best approach for managing complex AAAs.\n\nWhat did the researchers do?\nWe searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, summarized their results, and evaluated the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these treatments.\n\nWhat did the researchers find?\nWe found no studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause we found no suitable studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of these treatments. There is a lack of evidence in this area.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

I have just a few suggestions to make it even more accessible to a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms in the opening summary.** The first paragraph is the most important, and a few words might be unfamiliar to readers.    *   **The sentence:** 'The lack of robust evidence in this area is due to the low incidence rates of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and the heterogeneity of the aneurysms themselves...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Incidence rates' and 'heterogeneity' are technical terms that can be hard to understand.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'There is not enough good research because these aneurysms are rare, and they can be very different from person to person. This makes it hard to study them and get clear answers.'\n\n2. **Clarify the recommendation for future studies.** The current wording could be confusing for readers.\n    *   **The sentence:** 'To get better evidence, future research should be set up in a way that requires patients to be included in studies.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This might wrongly suggest that patients are not normally included in studies. The original point from the abstract is more nuanced.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'To get better evidence, future studies should be designed to make it easier for people with these aneurysms to take part in research.'\n\n3. **Make the 'What did the researchers do?' section more direct.** Since no studies were found, the description of the methods can be simplified.\n    *   **The sentence:** 'We searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, summarized their results, and evaluated the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these treatments.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is quite long (36 words). Mentioning summarizing results and evaluating evidence is slightly confusing when no studies were ultimately included.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that compared the three treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms: the stent-graft with holes, open surgery, and no surgery.'\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even better. All other aspects of the draft, including its structure, accuracy, and adherence to style guidelines, are excellent.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and style. Metrics for readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 11.35), sentence length (20.46 words), and active voice (51 instances) are all excellent. The number of complex words is slightly elevated but still within an acceptable range, which supports the need to simplify a few remaining technical terms."
