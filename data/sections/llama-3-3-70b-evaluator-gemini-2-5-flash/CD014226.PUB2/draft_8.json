  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive procedure using a stent-graft with holes to allow blood flow to nearby arteries) better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulge in the main blood vessel that can be life-threatening if it ruptures)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found no studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment. Therefore, we do not know if this procedure is better or worse for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible, which would help to answer important questions about the best treatment options for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases (including the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL) and trial registries for studies that directly compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative management in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur search did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no studies met our requirements, we cannot present any results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is the complete lack of studies that met our criteria. Because we found no relevant studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to other treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, a few key areas could be simplified to make the summary easier for patients to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the second key message.** The current version uses technical language from the original abstract that is not suitable for a lay audience.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible, which would help to answer important questions about the best treatment options for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'commissioning agreements' and 'mandating patient inclusion' are research jargon. This sentence is also very long (39 words) and focuses on the process of research rather than the outcome for patients.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'To answer these important questions, future research needs to be designed in a way that encourages more people to take part in studies.'\n\n2. **Shorten the long sentence in the 'How did we search for evidence?' section.** Listing specific databases is unnecessary detail for a plain language summary.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We searched major medical databases (including the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL) and trial registries for studies that directly compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative management in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence is 42 words long and contains a list of technical database names that don't add value for the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched major medical databases and trial registries to find all relevant studies. We looked for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.'\n\n3. **Make the research aims more direct and less technical.** The list of clinical outcomes can be simplified.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'all-cause mortality' and 'aneurysm-related mortality' are clinical terms. The sentence can be made more direct and easier to read.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We wanted to see how FEVAR affected survival, length of hospital stay, and patients' quality of life.'\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accessible for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary, with 61% of its features falling in the best quartile. However, metrics like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (13.22) and average words per sentence (22.4) are in the upper range of what is typical (P75), supporting the need to simplify complex sentences and technical vocabulary to improve readability for a lay audience."
