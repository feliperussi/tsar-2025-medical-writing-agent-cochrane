  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, we could not determine if fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive procedure using a stent-graft with holes to allow blood flow to nearby arteries) is better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulge in the main blood vessel that can be life‑threatening if it ruptures).",
    "We did not find any studies that compared the benefits and harms of fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.",
    "Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible, which would help to answer important questions about the best treatment options for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms."

      "subheading": "What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. If left untreated, AAAs can rupture, leading to severe bleeding and even death. Common treatments for AAAs include open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair, which involves using a stent-graft to reinforce the aorta."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. They aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies that directly compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative management in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. The search covered publications from inception to the present and used keywords and MeSH terms related to \"fenestrated\", \"endovascular\", \"aneurysm\", \"open repair\", and \"conservative\"."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Included studies were randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, and case‑control studies that reported clinical outcomes for FEVAR versus OSR or conservative treatment in complex AAAs. We excluded case series with fewer than 10 patients, studies lacking a comparator group, and those not reporting mortality or major adverse events."

      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes such as peri‑operative mortality, re‑intervention rates, aneurysm‑related mortality, and major complications. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when appropriate, pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis."

      "subheading": "Evidence Assessment",
      "content": "The body of evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Benefits (e.g., lower early mortality) and harms (e.g., higher re‑intervention) of FEVAR relative to OSR or conservative management were weighed to inform clinical recommendations."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Therefore, there are no characteristics of included studies to report. We did not identify eligible studies that compared treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms with fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair versus open surgical repair or conservative management. It is unclear if fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair has an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies overall, resulting in low confidence in the outcome results.",
