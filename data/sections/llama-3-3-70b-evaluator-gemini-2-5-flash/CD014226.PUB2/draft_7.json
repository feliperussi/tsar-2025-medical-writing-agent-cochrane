  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive procedure using a stent-graft with holes to allow blood flow to nearby arteries) better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulge in the main blood vessel that can be life-threatening if it ruptures)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We could not determine if fenestrated endovascular repair is better than open surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- We did not find any studies that compared the benefits and harms of fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- To help find the best treatment, future research should be designed to make it easier for people with this condition to be included in studies.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta - the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulging can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. This review looks at a specific type of minimally invasive surgery called 'fenestrated' endovascular repair (FEVAR), which uses a custom tube (stent-graft) with small openings to maintain blood flow to important arteries near the bulge.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. They aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies that directly compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative management in patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nOur search did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no studies met our requirements, we cannot present any results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is the complete lack of studies that met our criteria. Because we found no relevant studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to other treatments.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This summary is a good start but requires revisions before approval. There is a critical factual error, and several areas can be made clearer for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the incomplete search description.** The current text misrepresents the scope of the search, which is a factual error.\n    - **Problem:** The draft states, 'We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL...'. This omits several important databases listed in the original abstract, such as the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register and CINAHL.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please revise to accurately reflect the full search: 'We searched major medical databases (including the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL) and trial registries.'\n\n2. **Combine the repetitive 'Key messages'.** The first two messages say the same thing, which can confuse readers.\n    - **Problem:** The first message says you 'could not determine' the answer due to a lack of evidence, and the second says you 'did not find any studies'. This is redundant.\n    - **Suggestion:** Combine them into one clear message: 'We found no studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or no treatment. Therefore, we do not know if this procedure is better or worse for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.'\n\n3. **Simplify long sentences and use a consistent voice.** Some sentences are too long and the switch between 'we' and 'the review authors' is jarring.\n    - **Problem:** The sentence 'This review looks at a specific type of minimally invasive surgery called 'fenestrated' endovascular repair (FEVAR), which uses a custom tube (stent-graft) with small openings to maintain blood flow to important arteries near the bulge' is 35 words long and hard to follow.\n    - **Suggestion:** Break it into shorter sentences: 'This review looks at a specific type of minimally invasive surgery called 'fenestrated' endovascular repair (FEVAR). This procedure uses a custom tube (a stent-graft) with small openings to help blood flow to important arteries near the bulge.' Also, please use 'we' consistently instead of 'the review authors'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft's metrics are statistically typical for a PLS, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile. However, metrics like 'words per sentence' (23.43) and 'passive voice' (17 instances) are in the 75th percentile, indicating they are higher than in most summaries. This aligns with the editorial feedback, which suggests shortening sentences and using more active voice to improve clarity for readers."
