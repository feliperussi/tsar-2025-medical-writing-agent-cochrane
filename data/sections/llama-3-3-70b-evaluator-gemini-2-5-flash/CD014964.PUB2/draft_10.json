  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than physical touch for regional anesthesia in adults?\n\nRegional anesthesia involves an injection near the nerves in your back. Doctors usually find the right spot by feeling for bones (called 'anatomical landmarks'). We wanted to find out if using an ultrasound scanner to see inside the back is better than this standard method of using touch.\n\nKey messages:\n- Using ultrasound guidance for regional anesthesia in adults requires fewer attempts to succeed and shortens the procedure time.\n- It is likely more successful on the first attempt.\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe looked at several outcomes. We wanted to know if ultrasound guidance could improve the patient's experience, require fewer attempts, shorten the procedure time, and reduce problems like pain or other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with the standard method of using physical touch (anatomical landmarks) for regional anesthesia. We then summarized and combined their results and rated how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. We found strong evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. We also found moderate evidence that it increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are less certain about some findings because:\n- In some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used. This knowledge could have affected their behavior or how they reported things like pain, which might have skewed the results.\n- Many of the included studies were small.\n- The studies included different groups of people and used ultrasound in different ways. These differences made it harder to combine the results.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-written summary, but it needs a few revisions to be approved. The main issues are a failure to follow the style guide for subheadings and the use of imprecise terminology for the type of anaesthesia studied. Addressing these points will ensure the summary is both accurate and easy for readers to navigate.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use and explain the correct medical term for the procedure.**\n   - **The issue:** The draft uses the general term \"regional anesthesia,\" but the review is specifically about 'neuraxial anaesthesia' (like an epidural), which is a specific type of regional anaesthesia. This is an important distinction for accuracy.\n   - **Your text:** \"Regional anesthesia involves an injection near the nerves in your back.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This summary is about a type of pain relief called 'neuraxial anaesthesia', which involves an injection near the nerves in your back (for example, an epidural).\"\n\n2. **Rephrase the 'Key messages' subheading as a question.**\n   - **The issue:** The Master Style Guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. The current subheading is a statement.\n   - **Your text:** \"Key messages:\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What are the key messages of this review?\"\n\n3. **Make the explanation of study limitations more direct.**\n   - **The issue:** The explanation of bias is a little vague. Using more direct language helps readers better understand why this is a limitation.\n   - **Your text:** \"This knowledge could have affected their behavior or how they reported things like pain, which might have skewed the results.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used. This awareness could have influenced how they reported outcomes like pain, potentially making the results less reliable.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within or exceed the expected ranges for a Plain Language Summary, with 83% of features in the best-performing quartile.
