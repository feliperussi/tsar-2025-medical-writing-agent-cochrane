  "key_messages": [
    "Using ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body) for regional anesthesia (a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body) in adults is better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) because it reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time, likely increasing the rate of first-attempt success, with no reported harmful effects.",
    "Ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in patient satisfaction or technical failure, but the evidence is uncertain regarding its effects on pain during the procedure and adverse events, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation of these results.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties in the evidence, particularly regarding the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events, to provide more definitive answers to the question of whether ultrasound guidance is better than anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults."

      "subheading": "What is neuraxial anaesthesia and why is it important?",
      "content": "Neuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anaesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position. Successful neuraxial anaesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes to perform the procedure, while also looking at its effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. The population characteristics included adults aged 18 years or older, with 32 studies evaluating obstetric populations undergoing labour epidural or caesarean section, and the remaining studies evaluating participants who received surgery under neuraxial anaesthesia. The types of interventions and comparisons included ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia, with 33 studies evaluating spinal anaesthesia, 15 studies evaluating lumbar epidural anaesthesia, 12 studies evaluating combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia, and four studies evaluating thoracic epidural anaesthesia. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods for the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
