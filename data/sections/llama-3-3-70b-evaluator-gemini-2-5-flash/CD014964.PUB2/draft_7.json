  "draft": "Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for giving regional anesthesia to adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and the time needed to perform regional anesthesia.\n- It also likely increases the success rate on the first attempt.\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is regional anesthesia and why is it important?\nRegional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body, often for surgery. It involves an injection near the nerves in your back. Getting the injection in the right place on the first try is important to reduce problems and improve a patient's experience.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if ultrasound guidance is safer and works better than anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults. We looked at whether it can help patients have a better experience, reduce the number of attempts and the time needed for the procedure, and reduce technical problems, pain, or other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. We found strong evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. We also found moderate evidence that it increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are less certain about some findings because:\n- In some studies, patients and doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n- The studies included different groups of people and used ultrasound in different ways. These differences made it harder to combine the results.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults.",

Here are the top 3 areas to focus on:\n\n1. **Define key terms in the title.** The title uses technical terms without immediate explanation, which could prevent readers from understanding the topic.\n    *   **Current title:** 'Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for giving regional anesthesia to adults?'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** A patient may not know what 'anatomical landmarks' or 'regional anesthesia' are and might stop reading before realizing the summary is relevant to them.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Is using ultrasound guidance (a technique using sound waves to create images of the body) better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) for giving regional anesthesia (pain relief for a specific body area) to adults?'\n\n2. **Include all key limitations of the evidence.** The summary omits an important limitation mentioned in the source materials, which affects the reader's ability to judge the evidence's strength.\n    *   **Missing information:** The source notes that 'the studies were very small'.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Readers need to know that results from small studies can be less reliable. This is a crucial piece of context.\n    *   **Suggested action:** In the 'What are the limitations of the evidence?' section, add a bullet point: '- Many of the included studies were small.'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active verbs instead of noun phrases.** Some sentences are unnecessarily complex and formal. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of 'nominalizations' (23 instances, placing the text in the 90th percentile for this metric).\n    *   **Example sentence:** 'We searched for studies comparing ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'evaluated our confidence' are less direct and more abstract than using a simple verb.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia. We then summarized and combined their results and rated how certain we are about the evidence.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics like sentence length and reading ease falling in the best quartile (P25/P75). However, the analysis flagged a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), with 23 instances placing it in the P90 range, which can make sentences less direct and more abstract for readers."
