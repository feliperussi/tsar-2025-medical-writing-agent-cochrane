  "draft": "# Is using ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body) better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) for giving regional anesthesia (a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body) to adults?\n**Key Messages**\n- Using ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body) for regional anesthesia (a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body) in adults is better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) because it reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time, likely increasing the rate of first-attempt success, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in patient satisfaction or technical failure, but the evidence is uncertain regarding its effects on pain during the procedure and adverse events, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation of these results.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties in the evidence, particularly regarding the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events, to provide more definitive answers to the question of whether ultrasound guidance is better than anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults.\n**Introduction**\n### What is neuraxial anaesthesia and why is it important?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anaesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position. Successful neuraxial anaesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes to perform the procedure, while also looking at its effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. The population characteristics included adults aged 18 years or older, with 32 studies evaluating obstetric populations undergoing labour epidural or caesarean section, and the remaining studies evaluating participants who received surgery under neuraxial anaesthesia. The types of interventions and comparisons included ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia, with 33 studies evaluating spinal anaesthesia, 15 studies evaluating lumbar epidural anaesthesia, 12 studies evaluating combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia, and four studies evaluating thoracic epidural anaesthesia. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods for the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues. Firstly, there is a factual inaccuracy in the 'Currency' section regarding the search date. The original abstract states the electronic searches were updated on 28 November 2023, but the draft incorrectly states the evidence is up to date to October 2022. Secondly, several subheadings ('Key Messages', 'Methods', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, violating the Cochrane style guide. Thirdly, the text contains overly long and complex sentences, excessive nominalization, and redundant definitions, significantly hindering readability for the target audience. For example, the first key message is 69 words long and repeats definitions from the title. Phrases like 'reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction' could be simplified. These issues contribute to the poor readability scores, including a Flesch Reading Ease score in the P10 range and multiple other readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Automated Readability Index, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, Dale-Chall Readability, LIX, RIX, Coleman-Liau Index) and vocabulary complexity metrics (nominalization, complex words, long words) all falling into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 ranges, indicating significant deviation from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with only 16.7% of features falling within the best quartile.

Sentence structure is also problematic, with an average of 27.12 words per sentence (P90, target <22.1). Vocabulary complexity is high, with nominalization (33.0, BEYOND_P90, target <13.0), nouns (200.0, P90, target <116.0), and all complex/long word metrics (complex_words_dc, complex_words, long_words) in the BEYOND_P90 range, indicating an overuse of difficult and lengthy words."
