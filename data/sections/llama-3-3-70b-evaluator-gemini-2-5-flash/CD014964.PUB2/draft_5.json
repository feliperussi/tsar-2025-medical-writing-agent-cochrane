  "draft": "Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for giving regional anesthesia to adults?\n\nWe compared two methods for giving regional anesthesia: using ultrasound guidance and using anatomical landmarks. \n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and time needed for the procedure. \n- It also likely increases the success rate of the first attempt.\n- However, we are not sure about its effects on pain during the procedure and adverse events.\n\nWhat is regional anesthesia and why is it important?\nRegional anesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position. Successful regional anesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if ultrasound guidance is safer and works better than anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults. We looked at whether it can:\n- help patients have a better experience\n- reduce the number of attempts and the time needed for the procedure\n- reduce technical problems, pain, or other unwanted effects\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are less certain about the evidence because:\n- many of the studies were small\n- in some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used, which could have influenced the results\n- the studies included different types of patients and used ultrasound in different ways, making the results harder to combine\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the lack of a 'Key messages' heading, some abstract phrasing that could be simplified, and the use of similar-sounding words ('probably' and 'likely') to describe different levels of evidence certainty, which could confuse readers. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add a 'Key messages' heading and align the wording with the evidence certainty.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary at the top functions as key messages but is not labeled, which is a missed opportunity to orient the reader. The final bullet point is also a bit vague.\n   - **Current text:**\n     \"We compared two methods for giving regional anesthesia: using ultrasound guidance and using anatomical landmarks. \n     - Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and time needed for the procedure. \n     - It also likely increases the success rate of the first attempt.\n     - However, we are not sure about its effects on pain during the procedure and adverse events.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:**\n     \"**Key messages**\n     - Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and the time needed to perform regional anaesthesia.\n     - It also likely increases the success rate on the first attempt.\n     - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects (adverse events).\"\n\n2. **Simplify the explanation of why the procedure can be difficult.**\n   - **The issue:** The current explanation is abstract and uses wordy phrases that are hard for a lay reader to visualize.\n   - **Current text:** \"This type of anesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Giving this type of anaesthesia can be difficult. Doctors usually feel for bony points on the back (called anatomical landmarks) to find the right spot for the injection, but this can be hard to locate accurately by touch alone.\"\n\n3. **Use clearer terms to describe different levels of evidence.**\n   - **The issue:** The words 'probably' and 'likely' are used to describe findings with high and moderate certainty, respectively. To a lay reader, these words mean the same thing, which can cause confusion about the strength of the findings.\n   - **Current text:** \"Ultrasound guidance **probably** reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It **likely** increases the rate of first-attempt success.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found strong evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. We also found moderate evidence that it increases the rate of first-attempt success.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. An impressive 72% of its features fall into the best quartile of our corpus, with excellent scores for sentence length (words_per_sentence: 18.79, P25) and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 11.65, P25). The metrics for vocabulary complexity are also within the typical range. The feedback provided focuses on nuanced clarity issues, such as consistent terminology and structural formatting, which are not fully captured by the metrics but are crucial for reader comprehension."
