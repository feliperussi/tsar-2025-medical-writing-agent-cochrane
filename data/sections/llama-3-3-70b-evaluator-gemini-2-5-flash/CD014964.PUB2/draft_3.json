  "draft": "Is using ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body) better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) for giving neuraxial anesthesia (a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body) to adults?\n\nWe compared two methods for giving neuraxial anesthesia: using ultrasound guidance and using anatomical landmarks. \n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and time needed for the procedure. \n- It also likely increases the success rate of the first attempt.\n- However, we are not sure about its effects on pain during the procedure and adverse events.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anesthesia and why is it important?\nNeuraxial anesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position. Successful neuraxial anesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anesthesia in adults. They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes to perform the procedure, while also looking at its effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies comparing ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anesthesia, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anesthesia in adults.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and consistency for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n1. **Make the voice consistent by using 'we' throughout.**\nThe text switches between using \"we\" and \"the review authors.\" Sticking to \"we\" makes the summary more direct and easier to read, as recommended in the style guide.\n- **Problematic sentences:** \"The review authors wanted to assess...\" and \"What methods did the review authors use?\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Change these to \"We wanted to assess...\" and \"What methods did we use?\"\n\n2. **Simplify the language in the 'Limitations' section.**\nThe current wording uses technical terms that may be unclear to patients.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation, and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods for the intervention.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** To make this clearer, try explaining the *impact* of these limitations. For example: \"We are less certain about the evidence because:\n- many of the studies were small.\n- in some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used, which could have influenced the results.\n- the studies included different types of patients and used ultrasound in different ways, making the results harder to combine.\"\n\n3. **Break up long, complex sentences.**\nSome sentences contain multiple ideas, making them difficult to follow. This is especially true in the section explaining the review's aims.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes the procedure, while also looking at its effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Using a bulleted list can make these outcomes much clearer: \"We wanted to find out if ultrasound guidance could:\n- increase the success rate of the first attempt.\n- reduce the number of attempts and the time needed for the procedure.\n- improve patient satisfaction.\n- reduce technical problems, pain, or other unwanted effects.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary significantly more accessible and reader-friendly.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling in the best or median quartiles. However, the analysis also flags a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) and long words, which supports the editorial feedback to simplify complex sentences and replace abstract nouns with more direct verbs to improve readability."
