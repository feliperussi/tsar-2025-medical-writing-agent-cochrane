  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than physical touch for regional anesthesia in adults?\n\nRegional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body, often for surgery. It involves an injection near the nerves in your back. \n\nKey messages:\n- Using ultrasound guidance for regional anesthesia in adults requires fewer attempts to succeed and shortens the procedure time.\n- It is likely more successful on the first attempt.\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe looked at several outcomes. We wanted to know if ultrasound guidance could improve the patient's experience, require fewer attempts, shorten the procedure time, and reduce problems like pain or other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia. We then summarized and combined their results and rated how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. We found strong evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. We also found moderate evidence that it increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are less certain about some findings because:\n- In some studies, patients and doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n- Many of the included studies were small.\n- The studies included different groups of people and used ultrasound in different ways. These differences made it harder to combine the results.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores, but it is not approved because a few key areas need improvement to ensure patients can fully understand the context. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain the comparison methods in the introduction.** The introduction explains regional anesthesia but not the two methods being compared. This leaves the reader without the core context of the review.\n   - **Problem text:** \"Regional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body, often for surgery. It involves an injection near the nerves in your back.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This doesn't explain the standard method (using touch) that ultrasound is being compared against. The reader doesn't know what the alternative to ultrasound is.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Regional anesthesia involves an injection near the nerves in your back. Doctors usually find the right spot by feeling for bones (called 'anatomical landmarks'). We wanted to find out if using an ultrasound scanner to see inside the back is better than this standard method of using touch.\"\n\n2. **Use consistent terminology for the standard procedure.** The summary introduces a plain language term in the title but then uses a technical term later without connecting them.\n   - **Problem text:** The title uses \"physical touch,\" but the 'What methods did we use?' section uses \"anatomical landmarks.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers may not realize that \"physical touch\" and \"anatomical landmarks\" refer to the same thing, causing confusion.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** In the methods section, clarify the link: \"We searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with the standard method of using physical touch (anatomical landmarks) for regional anesthesia.\"\n\n3. **Make the explanation of limitations more concrete.** The description of bias is too abstract for a lay reader.\n   - **Problem text:** \"In some studies, patients and doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"influenced the results\" is vague. It doesn't explain *how* this knowledge could be a problem.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used. This knowledge could have affected their behaviour or how they reported things like pain, which might have skewed the results.\"\n\nMaking these changes will provide essential context and clarity for the reader. The linguistic analysis supports the need for more direct and concrete language, as the draft showed a slightly high use of abstract nouns ('nominalizations').",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 17 of 18 metrics (94%) are within the typical or best-quartile ranges, including excellent readability scores and short sentence length. The only deviation is a high rate of nominalization (P90), suggesting a tendency to use noun forms of verbs, which can make text less direct."
