  "draft": "Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for giving regional anesthesia to adults?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and the time needed to perform regional anesthesia.\n- It also likely increases the success rate on the first attempt.\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nWhat is regional anesthesia and why is it important?\nRegional anesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. Giving this type of anesthesia can be difficult. Doctors usually feel for bony points on the back (called anatomical landmarks) to find the right spot for the injection, but this can be hard to locate accurately by touch alone. Successful regional anesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if ultrasound guidance is safer and works better than anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults. We looked at whether it can help patients have a better experience, reduce the number of attempts and the time needed for the procedure, and reduce technical problems, pain, or other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. We found strong evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. We also found moderate evidence that it increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are less certain about the evidence because many of the studies were small, in some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used, which could have influenced the results, and the studies included different types of patients and used ultrasound in different ways, making the results harder to combine.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults.",

To make it even more patient-friendly, I recommend focusing on three key areas:\n\n1. **Simplify the definition of regional anesthesia.** The current explanation is a bit technical for a lay audience.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Regional anesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Regional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body, often for surgery. It involves an injection near the nerves in your back.'\n\n2. **Make the limitations clearer and more direct.** The explanation of the limitations is slightly vague and could be more specific. This also addresses the high number of nominalizations (noun-like words) flagged in the linguistic analysis.\n    *   **Current text:** 'in some studies, patients and doctors knew which method was being used, which could have influenced the results, and the studies included different types of patients and used ultrasound in different ways, making the results harder to combine.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We are less certain about some findings because:\n        - In some studies, patients and doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n        - The studies included different groups of people (such as people in labor or having other types of surgery) and used ultrasound in different ways. These differences made it harder to combine the results.'\n\n3. **Improve conciseness in the introduction.** One sentence is a bit long and could be more direct.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Successful regional anesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Getting the injection in the right place on the first try is important to reduce problems and improve a patient's experience.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.05) are excellent. However, the analysis identified one deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is higher than usual (22 instances, placing it in the 90th percentile). This suggests that some sentences could be more direct and action-oriented."
