  "draft": "Do patient decision aids improve health choices compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages:\n- Patient decision aids probably help adults make informed choices about their healthcare that align with their personal values.\n- These aids lead to better knowledge about health conditions and treatments, and a more active role in decision-making, without increasing decision regret.\n- Further studies are needed to assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence to chosen treatments and their effects on healthcare costs.\n\nWhat is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people face health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. Health decisions can be complex and involve weighing up the benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are interventions that make the decision explicit, provide evidence-based information about the options and associated benefits/harms, and help clarify personal values for features of options. They support people making health decisions and are particularly helpful when the decision is complex or involves uncertain outcomes.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of patient decision aids in adults considering treatment or screening decisions. They aimed to find out whether patient decision aids can increase the congruence between informed values and care choices, and whether they can improve participants' knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and participation in decision-making.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 209 studies that involved 107,698 participants. The studies were conducted on 71 different health decisions, with the most common decisions being about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While it passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness, several key sections use technical language and an inconsistent voice, which will create barriers for a lay audience. Here are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the definition of 'patient decision aids'.** The current definition is copied from the technical abstract and is too complex for a plain language summary.\n   - **Current text:** 'Patient decision aids are interventions that make the decision explicit, provide evidence-based information about the options and associated benefits/harms, and help clarify personal values for features of options.'\n   - **Problem:** Words like 'interventions', 'explicit', and 'clarify personal values for features of options' are jargon and difficult for many readers to understand.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Patient decision aids are tools like booklets, videos, or websites. They help you understand your health choices by clearly explaining the pros and cons of each option using reliable evidence. They also help you think about what is most important to you, so you can choose the option that best fits your personal values.'\n\n2. **Use a consistent, first-person voice ('we').** The draft switches between 'the review authors' and 'we', which can be confusing. The style guide requires using 'we' when referring to the review team.\n   - **Current text:** 'What did the review authors want to find out?' and 'How did the review authors find the information?'\n   - **Problem:** This creates an inconsistent and distant tone, and later switches to 'we' in the results section.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Change the subheadings to 'What did we want to find out?' and 'How did we find the information?'. Also, update the text in those sections, for example: 'We wanted to know if using these decision aids helps adults...' instead of 'The review authors wanted to assess...'\n\n3. **Rephrase technical goals in the 'Aims' section.** The description of the review's goals uses complex terms that are hard to follow.\n   - **Current text:** '...whether patient decision aids can increase the congruence between informed values and care choices, and whether they can improve participants' knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and participation in decision-making.'\n   - **Problem:** 'Congruence between informed values and care choices' is a highly technical phrase. The long list at the end is also dense.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** '...if using these decision aids helps adults make healthcare choices that match their personal values. We also looked at whether the aids improved people's understanding of their options and risks, and helped them take a more active part in making the decision.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis supports these recommendations, noting a high number of nouns (P90), which often corresponds with the use of technical terms and nominalizations (e.g., 'participation in decision-making' instead of 'take part in the decision'). Addressing the points above will improve clarity and also bring this metric closer to the typical range for a PLS.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling in the best quartile. Sentence length and voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified a high noun count (158, P90), which can indicate overly formal or complex phrasing. This aligns with editorial findings of technical language and nominalizations that could be simplified for better clarity."
