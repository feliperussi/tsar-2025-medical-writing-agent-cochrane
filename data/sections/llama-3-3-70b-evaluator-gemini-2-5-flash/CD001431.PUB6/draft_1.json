  "draft": "# Do patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed health decisions) improve health choices compared to usual care?\n**Key Messages**\n- Patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed health decisions) probably increase the likelihood that people's health choices align with their informed values compared to usual care, by improving knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and involvement in decision-making, without increasing decision regret, although the quality of the evidence varies.\n- Decision aids seem to help people feel more informed and clearer about their personal values, and may lead to a more active role in decision-making, but the effects on adherence to chosen options and downstream healthcare system impacts are not well understood and require further study.\n- Future research should focus on assessing the long-term effects of patient decision aids, including their impact on adherence, health outcomes, and healthcare costs, as well as exploring how decision aids can be best implemented in different healthcare settings to support informed decision-making.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people are faced with health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. This is because health decisions can be complex and involve weighing the benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\n### What are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are interventions that make the decision explicit, provide evidence-based information about the options and associated benefits/harms, and help clarify personal values for features of options. They can be used to support people making health decisions, and can be particularly useful for decisions that involve trade-offs between different benefits and harms.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of patient decision aids in adults considering treatment or screening decisions. They aimed to find out whether patient decision aids can increase the congruence between informed values and care choices, and whether they can improve participants' knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and participation in decision-making. They also wanted to know if patient decision aids can reduce decisional conflict and adverse events.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care, summarized and combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of patient decision aids on health decisions.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 209 studies that involved 107,698 participants. The studies were conducted on 71 different health decisions, with the most common decisions being about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There is no information available on the study funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study settings, including the countries where the studies took place, were also not specified. The types of interventions and comparisons were patient decision aids compared to usual care, with patient decision aids being interventions designed to support people making health decisions. No studies were found that did not involve patient decision aids. Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making. However, they may not affect how long consultations last or the level of regret people feel about their decisions.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and heterogeneity in study populations and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

The linguistic analysis confirms these issues, showing significant deviations from typical Plain Language Summary patterns in readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 11 out of 18 features falling into the P90 or Beyond P90 range. Specifically, readability indices such as `smog_index` (14.96, BEYOND_P90), `automated_readability?` (15.34, P90), `lix` (59.34, P90), `rix` (8.54, P90), and `dale_chall_readability` (8.17, P90) suggest the text is more difficult to read than typical PLS. Sentence structure metrics show `words_per_sentence` (24.50, P75) is on the higher side, and `passive_voice` (19.00, P90) is too frequent. Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, with `complex_words` (144.00, P90), `long_words` (239.00, BEYOND_P90), `nominalization` (23.00, P90), and `complex_words_dc` (302.00, BEYOND_P90) all significantly higher than typical. Additionally, `nouns` (242.00, BEYOND_P90) are excessively high, indicating a noun-heavy writing style. These deviations collectively suggest the text is less accessible and harder to understand for a lay audience than is ideal for a Plain Language Summary."
