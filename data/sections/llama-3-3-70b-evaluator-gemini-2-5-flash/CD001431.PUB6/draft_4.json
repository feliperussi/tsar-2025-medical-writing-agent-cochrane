  "draft": "Do patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed health decisions) improve health choices compared to usual care?\n\nWe looked at 209 studies that involved over 107,000 participants. These studies compared patient decision aids to usual care for 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about treatments for heart disease, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery.\n\nKey messages:\n- Patient decision aids probably help people make health choices that align with their values. They do this by improving knowledge, helping people understand the risks and benefits, and encouraging involvement in decision-making.\n- Decision aids seem to help people feel more informed and clearer about their personal values. They may also help more people take an active part in decisions.\n- However, we need more research to understand how decision aids affect people's adherence to their chosen options and the impact on the healthcare system.\n\nWhat is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people face health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. Health decisions can be complex and involve weighing the benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are tools like booklets, videos, or websites. They help you understand your health choices by:\n- Clearly explaining the decision you need to make\n- Giving reliable information about the good and bad points of each option\n- Helping you think about what is most important to you\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if these aids help people make choices that match their personal values. We also looked at whether the aids improved people's knowledge, helped them understand risks correctly, and encouraged them to take part in the decision.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care, summarized and combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of patient decision aids on health decisions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nPatient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. People who used them were more likely to understand their options, including the benefits and harms. The aids may have also helped more people take an active part in making the decision.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and the studies included a wide variety of people and used the decision aids in different ways, which can make the results harder to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a very well-written draft that is clear, concise, and factually accurate. The linguistic metrics are excellent across the board, showing the text is easy to read and stylistically sound. However, I am recommending a few revisions to ensure all key findings are included and to further improve clarity before final approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Include the key finding on 'decision regret'.**\n   - **Problem:** The Key Messages section omits the important, high-certainty finding that decision aids did not cause more 'decision regret' compared to usual care. This is a reassuring result for patients and a key takeaway from the review.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Add this to your second key message. For example: 'Decision aids seem to help people feel more informed and clearer about their personal values, without causing more regret about their final choice.'\n\n2. **Simplify the sentence on evidence limitations.**\n   - **Problem:** The sentence listing the limitations is long (29 words) and combines three distinct points, which can be hard to follow.\n   - **Quote:** 'The evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and the studies included a wide variety of people and used the decision aids in different ways, which can make the results harder to compare.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Use a bulleted list to make the limitations easier to digest:\n     'The evidence has some limitations:\n     - It was not always possible to 'blind' participants (meaning they knew which treatment they were getting).\n     - Some studies did not report all their results.\n     - The studies included many different types of people and used the aids in various ways, which makes it harder to compare the results.'\n\n3. **Make the third key message more specific.**\n   - **Problem:** The phrase 'impact on the healthcare system' in the third key message is a bit vague.\n   - **Quote:** 'However, we need more research to understand how decision aids affect people's adherence to their chosen options and the impact on the healthcare system.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Use more specific language from the source material to clarify what needs further study. For example: 'However, we need more research to understand the long-term effects of decision aids on whether people stick to their chosen option, their overall health, and healthcare costs.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 17 of 18 metrics (94.4%) fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, including excellent scores for sentence length (18 words on average) and active voice. All readability indices, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.5), indicate the text is accessible. No metrics show significant deviation, confirming the draft is structurally and stylistically sound."
