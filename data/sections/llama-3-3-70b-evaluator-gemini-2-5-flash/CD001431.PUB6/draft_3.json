  "draft": "Do patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed health decisions) improve health choices compared to usual care?\n\nWe looked at 209 studies that involved over 107,000 participants. These studies compared patient decision aids to usual care for 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about treatments for heart disease, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery.\n\nKey messages:\n- Patient decision aids probably help people make health choices that align with their values. They do this by improving knowledge, helping people understand the risks and benefits, and encouraging involvement in decision-making.\n- Decision aids seem to help people feel more informed and clearer about their personal values. They may also lead to a more active role in decision-making.\n- However, we need more research to understand how decision aids affect people's adherence to their chosen options and the impact on the healthcare system.\n\nWhat is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people face health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. Health decisions can be complex and involve weighing the benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are tools like booklets, videos, or websites. They help you understand your health choices by:\n- Clearly explaining the decision you need to make\n- Giving reliable information about the good and bad points of each option\n- Helping you think about what is most important to you\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if these aids help people make choices that match their personal values. We also looked at whether the aids improved people's knowledge, helped them understand risks correctly, and encouraged them to take part in the decision.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care, summarized and combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of patient decision aids on health decisions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nPatient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making. However, they may not affect how long consultations last or the level of regret people feel about their decisions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and heterogeneity in study populations and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

However, a few minor revisions are needed to replace technical jargon and simplify sentence structures to make the key findings even easier for readers to understand. \n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Replace the technical term 'heterogeneity'.**\n   - **Problem:** In the 'Limitations' section, you use a word that will be unfamiliar to most readers.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...and heterogeneity in study populations and intervention delivery methods.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and the studies included a wide variety of people and used the decision aids in different ways, which can make the results harder to compare.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like \"take an active role in decision-making\" are less direct and contribute to a high noun count. Using a simpler verb makes the sentence more active and easier to read.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"They may also lead to a more active role in decision-making.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"They may also help more people take an active part in decisions.\"\n\n3. **Break up long sentences that contain multiple findings.**\n   - **Problem:** The first sentence in the 'What did we find?' section combines three distinct results, which can reduce their impact and make the sentence complex.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. People who used them were more likely to understand their options, including the benefits and harms. The aids may have also helped more people take an active part in making the decision.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 88.9% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. The only notable deviation is the noun count (162.0), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests some sentences are less direct than they could be, which supports the editorial feedback to simplify noun-heavy phrases and replace jargon."
