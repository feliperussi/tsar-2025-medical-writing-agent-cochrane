  "draft": "Do patient decision aids improve health choices compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages:\n- Patient decision aids probably help adults make informed choices about their healthcare that align with their personal values.\n- These aids lead to better knowledge about health conditions and treatments, and a more active role in decision-making, without increasing decision regret.\n- Further studies are needed to assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence to chosen treatments and their effects on healthcare costs.\n\nWhat is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people face health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. Health decisions can be complex and involve weighing up the benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are tools like booklets, videos, or websites. They help you understand your health choices by clearly explaining the pros and cons of each option using reliable evidence. They also help you think about what is most important to you, so you can choose the option that best fits your personal values.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if using these decision aids helps adults make healthcare choices that match their personal values. We also looked at whether the aids improved people's understanding of their options and risks, and helped them take a more active part in making the decision.\n\nHow did we find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 209 studies that involved 107,698 participants. The studies were conducted on 71 different health decisions, with the most common decisions being about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that are in line with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

However, it is not approved because key sections contain unexplained technical terms that will be confusing for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to make the summary clear and accessible:\n\n1. **Explain the limitations of the evidence in plain language.** The current text uses technical research terms without any explanation.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'The evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'blinding' and 'heterogeneity' are meaningless to most patients and prevent them from understanding the real-world limitations of the research.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, some studies did not report on all their findings. Finally, the people and the decision aids used in the studies were very different from each other, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.'\n\n2. **Simplify the description of the review methods.** The current explanation uses language that describes the technical research process rather than the general approach.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'We searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'summarized and combined their results' and 'evaluated our confidence' are jargon for the systematic review process.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We looked for studies that compared patient decision aids with the usual care people receive. We then collected and analyzed the results from all these studies to understand what the evidence.\n\n3. **Replace jargon with simpler words.** A few technical terms are used where simpler alternatives exist.\n    *   **Problematic text:** '...assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence to chosen treatments...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Adherence' is clinical jargon.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** '...see if patient decision aids help people stick to their chosen treatments...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. An impressive 78% of the metrics fall into the best quartile for readability, including excellent scores for sentence length (words_per_sentence: 18.33) and active voice (54 instances). All readability scores, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.33), are well within the target range. While these metrics indicate a strong structural foundation, they do not capture the use of specific, unexplained technical terms in key sections, which is the primary issue needing correction."
