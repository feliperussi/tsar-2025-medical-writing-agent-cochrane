  "draft": "Do patient decision aids improve health choices compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages:\n- Patient decision aids probably help adults make informed choices about their healthcare that align with their personal values.\n- These aids lead to better knowledge about health conditions and treatments, and a more active role in decision-making, without increasing decision regret (the feeling of disappointment after making a decision).\n- Further studies are needed to assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence to chosen treatments and their effects on healthcare costs.\n\nWhat is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people face health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. Health decisions can be complex and involve weighing up the benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are tools like booklets, videos, or websites. They help you understand your health choices by clearly explaining the pros and cons of each option using reliable evidence. They also help you think about what is most important to you, so you can choose the option that best fits your personal values.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if using these decision aids helps adults make healthcare choices that match their personal values. We also looked at whether the aids improved people's understanding of their options and risks, and helped them take a more active part in making the decision.\n\nHow did we find the information?\nWe looked for studies that compared patient decision aids with the usual care people receive. We then collected and analyzed the results from all these studies to understand what the evidence shows.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 209 studies that involved 107,698 participants. The studies were conducted on 71 different health decisions, with the most common decisions being about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. The evidence shows that patient decision aids lead to better knowledge about health conditions and treatments, and a more active role in decision-making, without increasing decision regret. They also increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, some studies did not report on all their findings. Finally, the people and the decision aids used in the studies were very different from each other, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
