  "draft": "Can changing the schedule of shift work (the times and hours that people work, especially at night) improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nWe found that changing shift work schedules may help workers feel less sleepy, but the evidence is uncertain. It is not clear if changing schedules improves how long or how well people sleep. Some changes, like rotating shifts faster, might even reduce sleep time. Limiting a single shift to 16 hours may help workers sleep longer and feel less sleepy.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem? \nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may be less safe and healthy at work, and may be more likely to have accidents or make errors. To help with these problems, workers might use treatments like sleep aids or therapy. This review looked at a different approach: whether changing the work schedule itself could help.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to know if changing shift work schedules can improve how well and how long workers sleep, and make them feel less sleepy. We looked at different types of changes, such as: \n- how quickly shifts rotate \n- the length of each shift \n- the amount of time off between shifts \n- whether workers had a say in their schedules\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedules. Here is what we found:\n- Limiting shifts to 16 hours: This may help workers sleep longer and feel less sleepy.\n- Rotating shifts faster: This may reduce sleepiness but might also reduce how long people sleep.\n- Changing shift length or compressing the work week: These changes seemed to have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness.\nFor most of these findings, the evidence was very uncertain.\n\nHow did we find this information? \nWe searched for studies that changed shift work schedules, then collected and analyzed their results on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. Most studies were small and did not always report all their results. The people in the studies and the schedule changes were very different, which makes it hard to compare findings. In some studies, workers knew which schedule they were on, which might have influenced their answers.",
