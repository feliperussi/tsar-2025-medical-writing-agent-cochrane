  "draft": "What are the key messages of this review?\n- Changing shift work schedules may help workers feel less sleepy, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- It is not clear if changing schedules improves how long or how well people sleep. Some changes, like rotating shifts faster, might even reduce sleep time.\n- Limiting a single shift to 16 hours may help workers sleep longer and feel less sleepy.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem? \nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may be less safe and healthy at work, and may be more likely to have accidents or make errors.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of adapting shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They looked at different ways to change work schedules, for example by changing:\n- how quickly shifts rotate (from day to night shifts)\n- the length of each shift\n- the amount of time off between shifts\n- whether workers had a say in their schedules\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedules. We found that adapting shift work schedules may reduce sleepiness during shifts and make little to no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness, but the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.\n\nHow did we find this information? \nWe searched for studies on adapting shift work schedules, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess effects on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different types of people. The new schedules were also introduced in different ways, which makes the results harder to compare.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and highly readable, but it must be revised due to a critical factual error regarding the search date. Additionally, several sections could be clearer and more specific to better help the reader understand the findings and their limitations.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Factual Error:** The search date is incorrect. The draft states the evidence is current to December 2020, but the abstract confirms a more recent search was conducted in April 2022. This must be corrected to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1. **Correct the Search Date:** The currency statement is factually incorrect and misleads the reader about how up-to-date the review is.\n   - **Current Text:** \"The evidence is up to date to December 2020.\"\n   - **Problem:** The abstract states, \"We searched... on 13 December 2020, and again on 20 April 2022\". The draft omits the most recent search.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is up to date to April 2022.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the Main Findings:** The results are presented in a single dense paragraph, making it difficult for readers to distinguish the effects of different schedule changes.\n   - **Current Text:** \"We found that adapting shift work schedules may reduce sleepiness during shifts and make little to no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness...\"\n   - **Problem:** Lumping general and specific findings together is confusing. Using a list would make the key results easier to scan and understand.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found 11 studies with 2125 people. The studies looked at different types of schedule changes. Here is what we found:\n   - **Limiting shifts to 16 hours:** This may help workers sleep longer and feel less sleepy.\n   - **Rotating shifts faster:** This may reduce sleepiness but might also reduce how long people sleep.\n   - **Changing shift length or compressing the work week:** These changes seemed to have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness.\n   For most of these findings, the evidence was very uncertain.\"\n\n3. **Make Limitations More Specific:** The limitations section is vague and omits important details that explain why the evidence is uncertain.\n   - **Current Text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different types of people. The new schedules were also introduced in different ways, which makes the results harder to compare.\"\n   - **Problem:** This misses key issues mentioned in the source material, such as participants knowing their treatment group ('lack of blinding') and incomplete results.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. Most studies were small and did not always report all their results. The people in the studies and the schedule changes were very different, which makes it hard to compare findings. In some studies, workers knew which schedule they were on, which might have influenced their answers.\"\n\n**PLS Evaluation Summary:**\nThe PLS evaluation shows the draft has excellent readability and sentence structure, conforming well to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within or better than the median range for Cochrane PLSs, with 72% in the best quartile. Metrics for sentence length (19.18 words), passive voice (3 instances), and reading grade level (9.3) are particularly strong. The required revisions are focused on factual accuracy and content clarity, not stylistic or linguistic issues.",
