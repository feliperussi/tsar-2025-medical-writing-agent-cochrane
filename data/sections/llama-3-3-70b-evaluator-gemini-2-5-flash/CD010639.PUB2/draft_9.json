  "draft": "Can changing the schedule of shift work improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers? Here are the key messages from this review: \n- Changing the schedule of shift work may help workers feel less sleepy, but the evidence is uncertain - it is not clear if changing schedules improves how well people sleep, and some changes, like rotating shifts faster, might even reduce how long people sleep.\n- Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness during shifts, but the evidence for other shift schedule changes is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies to better understand the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem? \nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may experience negative effects on their occupational health and safety, including increased risk of accidents and errors. To treat problems from shift work, doctors might suggest therapies to improve sleep habits or prescribe medicines like melatonin or sleep aids.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to know if changing shift work schedules can improve how well and how long workers sleep, and make them feel less sleepy. We looked at different types of changes, such as \n- how quickly shifts rotate \n- the length of each shift \n- the amount of time off between shifts \n- whether workers had a say in their schedules\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedules. We found that limiting shifts to 16 hours may help workers sleep longer and feel less sleepy. Rotating shifts faster may reduce sleepiness but might also reduce how long people sleep. Changing shift length or compressing the work week seemed to have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness. For most of these findings, the evidence was very uncertain.\n\nHow did we find this information? \nWe searched for studies that changed shift work schedules, then collected and analyzed their results on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. Most studies were small and did not always report all their results. The people in the studies and the schedule changes were very different, which makes it hard to compare findings. In some studies, workers knew which schedule they were on, which might have influenced their answers.",

This must be corrected to accurately reflect the currency of the review.\n    - **Quote:** 'The evidence is up to date to December 2020.'\n    - **Suggestion:** 'The evidence is up to date to April 2022.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n1. **Clarify the Methods Section:** The description of your methods is generic and uses jargon like 'risk of bias'. Explaining *why* you took these steps in simpler terms will help readers understand the process.\n    - **Quote:** 'We assessed the risk of bias of included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    - **Suggestion:** 'We also evaluated how well the studies were done to judge how reliable the evidence is.'\n\n2. **Remove Distracting Information:** The sentence about medical treatments is not relevant to a review about schedule changes and could confuse readers about the review's focus.\n    - **Quote:** 'To treat problems from shift work, doctors might suggest therapies to improve sleep habits or prescribe medicines like melatonin or sleep aids.'\n    - **Suggestion:** Remove this sentence. If you feel it is essential context, rephrase it to lead into the review's question: 'While doctors can suggest therapies or medicines, we wanted to know if changing the work schedule itself could help.'\n\n3. **Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences:** Some sentences are a bit formal and rely on nouns instead of verbs, making them less direct for a lay audience.\n    - **Quote:** 'As a result, shift workers may experience negative effects on their occupational health and safety, including increased risk of accidents and errors.'\n    - **Suggestion:** 'This can affect their health and safety at work, and increase the risk of accidents and errors.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and active voice. However, the noun count is higher than typical (in the 90th percentile), which supports the recommendation to rephrase some sentences using more direct verbs instead of abstract noun forms."
