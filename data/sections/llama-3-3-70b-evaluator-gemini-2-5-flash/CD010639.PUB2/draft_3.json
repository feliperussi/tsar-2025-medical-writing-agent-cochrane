  "draft": "Can changing the schedule of shift work improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that changing shift work schedules may reduce sleepiness in shift workers, but the evidence is uncertain. It's also unclear if it improves sleep quality or sleep duration. Some studies suggest that faster rotation may actually decrease sleep duration. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness during shifts. However, the evidence for other shift schedule changes, such as forward rotation or compressed workweeks, is very uncertain and does not show a clear benefit for sleep quality or sleep duration.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies to better understand the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem?\nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may be less safe and healthy at work, and may be more likely to have accidents or make errors.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of adapting shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They investigated various shift schedule components, such as the permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedules. We found that adapting shift work schedules may reduce sleepiness during shifts and make little to no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness, but the evidence is of low to moderate certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and included different types of people. The new schedules were also introduced in different ways, which makes the results harder to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies on adapting shift work schedules, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess effects on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nResults\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. The included studies evaluated various shift schedule components, including permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation. Adapting shift work schedules may reduce sleepiness during shifts and make little to no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness, but the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHowever, the evidence for other schedule changes is very uncertain. This includes changes like 'forward rotation' (where shifts move from morning to evening to night) or 'compressed workweeks' (where people work longer hours on fewer days). We need more high-quality studies to better understand the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It contains a critical factual error regarding the evidence search date and does not follow the required style for subheadings. Additionally, the text uses overly complex and technical language, with several sections being repetitive. Addressing these key issues will significantly improve clarity for readers.\n\n### Critical Issues\n\n1.  **Factual Error:** The search date is incorrect. The draft states the evidence is up-to-date to December 2020, but the abstract clearly states a more recent search was conducted in April 2022.\n2.  **Formatting:** Two subheadings ('Methods', 'Results') are not phrased as questions, which violates the style guide.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n1.  **Correct the Search Date for Accuracy.**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"Is the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to December 2020.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is factually incorrect. The abstract states, \"We searched... on 13 December 2020, and again on 20 April 2022.\" Providing the wrong date misleads the reader about the currency of the review.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Is the evidence up to date? The evidence is up-to-date to April 2022.\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Complex, Noun-Heavy Language.**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement\" are jargon. This sentence is heavy with nouns and abstract concepts, making it difficult for a layperson to understand.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies looked at different changes to work schedules and measured the results in different ways. This makes the findings hard to compare.\"\n\n3.  **Remove Redundant Sections and Fix Subheadings.**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** The draft includes a \"What did we find?\" section, and then later repeats much of the same information under separate \"Methods\" and \"Results\" subheadings. These final two subheadings are also not phrased as questions.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The repetition is confusing and makes the summary longer than necessary. The incorrect subheading format violates a key structural rule of the style guide.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Delete the final \"Methods\" and \"Results\" sections entirely. Ensure all unique and important information from them is integrated into the earlier sections that use question-based headings (e.g., 'What did the review authors want to find out?', 'What did we find?').",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While the draft performs well on sentence-level metrics like sentence length (words_per_sentence: P25) and use of active voice (active_voice: P75), it deviates significantly on vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' range, indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. This is driven by a high number of nominalizations (45.0), nouns (264.0), complex words (147.0), and long words (230.0), resulting in a very high SMOG index (15.17). These scores confirm the editorial feedback that the language is too technical and noun-heavy for a lay audience."
