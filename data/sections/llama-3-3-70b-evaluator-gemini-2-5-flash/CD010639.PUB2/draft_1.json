  "draft": "# Can changing the schedule of shift work (the times and hours that people work, especially at night) improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Changing the schedule of shift work (the times and hours that people work, especially at night) may improve sleepiness in shift workers, but the evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear if it improves sleep quality or sleep duration, with some studies suggesting that faster rotation may actually decrease sleep duration, and no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness during shifts, but the evidence for other shift schedule changes, such as forward rotation, faster rotation, or compressed workweeks, is very uncertain and does not show a clear benefit for sleep quality or sleep duration.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies, preferably randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group, which helps to ensure that the groups are similar), to better understand the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers, and to address the key limitations and unanswered questions in this area.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is shift work and why is it a problem?\nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside the traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may experience negative effects on their occupational health and safety, including increased risk of accidents and errors. Common treatments for shift work disorders include behavioral therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, and pharmacological interventions, like melatonin or sleep aids.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of adapting shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They investigated various shift schedule components, such as the permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation. The authors sought to determine which adaptations to shift work schedules are most effective in improving sleep outcomes and reducing sleepiness in shift workers.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on adapting shift work schedules, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess effects on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. The included studies evaluated various shift schedule components, including permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation. Three controlled before-after trials compared forward versus backward rotation, two controlled before-after trials and one non-randomised cross-over trial evaluated faster versus slower shift rotation, two randomised controlled trials compared limited shift duration of 16 hours versus unlimited shift duration, one randomised controlled trial, one controlled before-after trial, and one non-randomised cross-over trial compared shorter versus longer shifts, and one randomised controlled trial and one controlled before-after trial compared more compressed versus more spread out shift schedules. The studies were conducted in various settings, but the specific countries were not mentioned. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The studies did not provide information on the funding sources or the duration of the interventions. Adapting shift work schedules may reduce sleepiness during shifts and make little to no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness, but the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.",

The currency statement is factually incorrect, and a subheading is not phrased as a question. The text also suffers from overly long sentences, excessive passive voice, and redundancy, making it difficult for a general audience to understand.

Only 5.6% of features fall within the best quartile, and 77.8% are 'Beyond P90', meaning they deviate significantly from typical patterns. Key areas of concern include an average sentence length of 31.56 words (target <22.1), a low Flesch Reading Ease score of 31.44 (target >40.5), and high grade-level scores across all readability indices (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 16.71, Gunning Fog Index 22.56, SMOG Index 16.71). The text also exhibits excessive passive voice (26 instances, target <13.0), high nominalization (49 instances, target <13.0), and a high noun count (305 instances, target <116.0), all contributing to its complexity and reduced readability for a lay audience. Vocabulary complexity metrics (complex_words_dc, complex_words, long_words) are also significantly higher than typical PLS patterns."
