Heel-lance procedures involve pricking the heel of a newborn baby to collect a blood sample, which can be painful for the baby. Sucrose analgesia is used to help calm and comfort the baby during this procedure. It is a common practice in hospitals to use sucrose to help reduce the pain and distress associated with heel-lance procedures in neonates.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about sucrose analgesia for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective sucrose is in relieving pain in neonates during heel-lance procedures, compared to other methods such as water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and other interventions. They also wanted to assess the safety and potential side effects of using sucrose for this purpose. The authors aimed to summarize the available evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia in reducing pain in neonates during heel-lance procedures.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing sucrose to other pain‑relieving methods for heel lance in neonates, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 55 studies that involved 6273 infants. The studies were conducted in various countries and included term and preterm neonates. Most studies investigated the effect of sucrose on pain relief during heel lance procedures, with some also examining other minor painful procedures. The studies compared sucrose to various control treatments, including water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care. The duration of the studies was not specified, but they generally focused on immediate and short-term outcomes. There was no information provided about the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics included term and preterm neonates, with no specific information about age or gender. The study settings were not detailed, but it is assumed that they took place in healthcare facilities. No studies were found that examined the long-term effects of sucrose on pain relief in neonates. The intervention probably causes a reduction in pain scores. It may make little to no difference in pain scores when compared to other interventions. However, the effects of this treatment vary, so it is possible that it may make little or no difference.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and methods of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
