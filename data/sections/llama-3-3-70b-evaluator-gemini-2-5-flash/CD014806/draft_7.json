  "draft": "Can giving sugar reduce pain from a heel prick for newborn babies? A heel prick is a procedure to collect a small blood sample from a baby’s heel. We found that sugar probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies during a heel prick, compared to not giving them anything. However, we are not sure if it is better or worse than other methods of pain relief, such as non-nutritive sucking or breastfeeding. The quality of the evidence about the effectiveness of sugar for pain relief in newborn babies is not strong, and we need more research to be sure about how well it works and if it is safe, especially when compared to other treatments like glucose or expressed breast milk. More research is needed to compare sugar with other pain relief methods and to understand its long-term effects. This will help doctors and parents choose the safest and most effective ways to comfort babies during medical procedures. We have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons: many of the studies were very small, the studies were very different from each other, and in some studies, it was possible for parents or staff to know which treatment a baby received, which could have influenced the results. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft has been graded as 'NOT_APPROVED' because it fails a critical structural requirement. The entire summary is presented as a single paragraph, completely missing the mandatory Plain Language Summary structure of a question-based title and distinct sections with question-based subheadings (e.g., 'What did we want to find out?', 'What did we find?'). This makes it very difficult for a reader to navigate and understand the information. Additionally, the flow of information is confusing, and the text could be made more direct by using more active voice.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the required PLS structure and subheadings.** The current 'wall of text' is not scannable. You must restructure the content under the standard question-based headings.\n   - **Problem:** The draft is one long paragraph, violating the core structural rules of a PLS.\n   - **Suggestion:** Reorganize the existing text and information from the 'SOURCE_OF_TRUTH' under headings like:\n     - 'Is sugar effective for pain from a heel prick in newborn babies?'\n     - 'What did we want to find out?'\n     - 'What did we find?'\n     - 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'\n     - 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'\n\n2. **Improve the logical flow by separating the limitations.** The reasons for low confidence in the evidence are tacked on at the end, which feels abrupt and confusing.\n   - **Quote:** \"This will help doctors and parents choose the safest and most effective ways to comfort babies during medical procedures. We have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons: many of the studies were very small...\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence interrupts the concluding thought by suddenly introducing the study limitations.\n   - **Suggestion:** Create a dedicated section for limitations under a heading like, \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and place the sentence about small studies and other issues there.\n\n3. **Increase the use of active voice to be more direct.** The summary uses passive phrasing, which can make the text less engaging and clear about who is responsible for the action.\n   - **Quote:** \"More research is needed to compare sugar with other pain relief methods...\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a passive construction. The style guide recommends using the active voice ('We...').\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this in the active voice. For example: \"Researchers need to conduct more studies that compare sugar with other pain relief methods...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft uses simple vocabulary and is generally easy to read, with most readability scores falling within the best quartile (P25). However, the analysis also highlights two areas for improvement that support the editorial feedback. The average sentence length is slightly high (24.56 words, P75), suggesting that breaking up longer sentences could improve clarity. More significantly, the use of active voice is very low (P10), deviating from typical PLS patterns and confirming the need for a more direct and engaging style."
