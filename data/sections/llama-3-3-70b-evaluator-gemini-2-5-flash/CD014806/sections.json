  "key_messages": [
    "Sucrose (a type of sugar) probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies undergoing a heel prick (a minor surgical procedure that involves pricking the heel to collect blood samples), compared to not giving them anything, but we are not sure if it is better or worse than other methods of pain relief, such as non-nutritive sucking (when a baby sucks on something but does not get any milk), breastfeeding, or other treatments.",
    "The quality of the evidence about the effectiveness of sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies is not strong, and we need more research to be sure about how well it works and if it is safe, especially when compared to other treatments like glucose (a type of sugar) or expressed breast milk (milk that is pumped and stored for later use).",
    "Future research should focus on comparing sucrose to other pain relief methods, and looking at how it affects babies in the long term, to help doctors and parents make informed decisions about the best way to reduce pain during medical procedures, and to make sure that we are using the safest and most effective treatments for newborn babies."

      "content": "Sucrose analgesia refers to the use of sucrose (a type of sugar) to help relieve pain in newborn babies (neonates) during medical procedures, such as heel-lance procedures. Heel-lance procedures involve pricking the heel of a newborn baby to collect a blood sample, which can be painful for the baby. Sucrose analgesia is used to help calm and comfort the baby during this procedure. It is a common practice in hospitals to use sucrose to help reduce the pain and distress associated with heel-lance procedures in neonates."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out how effective sucrose is in relieving pain in neonates during heel-lance procedures, compared to other methods such as water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and other interventions. They also wanted to assess the safety and potential side effects of using sucrose for this purpose. The authors aimed to summarize the available evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia in reducing pain in neonates during heel-lance procedures."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 55 studies that involved 6273 infants. The studies were conducted in various countries and included term and preterm neonates. Most studies investigated the effect of sucrose on pain relief during heel lance procedures, with some also examining other minor painful procedures. The studies compared sucrose to various control treatments, including water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care. The duration of the studies was not specified, but they generally focused on immediate and short-term outcomes. There was no information provided about the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics included term and preterm neonates, with no specific information about age or gender. The study settings were not detailed, but it is assumed that they took place in healthcare facilities. No studies were found that examined the long-term effects of sucrose on pain relief in neonates. The intervention probably causes a reduction in pain scores. It may make little to no difference in pain scores when compared to other interventions. However, the effects of this treatment vary, so it is possible that it may make little or no difference."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and methods of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
