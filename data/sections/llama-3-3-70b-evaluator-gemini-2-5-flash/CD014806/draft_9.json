  "draft": "Is sucrose effective for pain from a heel prick in newborn babies?\nWe wanted to find out if giving sugar to newborn babies reduces pain from a heel prick. A heel prick is a procedure to collect a small blood sample from a baby’s heel.\n\nKey messages\n- Sucrose (a type of sugar) probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies during a heel prick compared to giving them nothing.\n- We are not sure if sucrose is better or worse than other pain relief methods like non-nutritive sucking (when a baby sucks on something but does not get any milk) or breastfeeding.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong, and we need more research to be sure about how well sucrose works and if it is safe in the long term.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared giving sucrose to other pain-relieving methods, such as giving water or another sugar (glucose), non-nutritive sucking (letting a baby suck on a pacifier), breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care (placing the baby directly on the parent's chest).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that sucrose probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies during a heel prick, compared to not giving them anything. However, the evidence was uncertain when comparing sucrose to other methods like breastfeeding. Sucrose seems to work about as well as giving other sugars (like glucose), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe quality of the evidence about the effectiveness of sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies is not strong, and we need more research to be sure about how well it works and if it is safe. The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022. Researchers need to conduct more studies that compare sugar with other pain relief methods and look at how it affects babies in the long term. This will help doctors and parents choose the safest and most effective ways to comfort babies during medical procedures.",

      "feedback": "This draft is very well-written and easy to read, which is reflected in its excellent readability scores. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because it's missing a required section and has a few structural issues that need fixing before publication. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add a 'Methods' section.** The summary is missing a section explaining how the review was conducted. This is a critical part of a PLS. \n   - **Problem:** Readers need to know how the evidence was found. The draft currently jumps from the aims to the results.\n   - **Suggested Action:** Please add a new section with a heading like 'How did we conduct this review?' and include a brief description of the methods, such as: 'We searched for studies that compare giving sucrose with other pain-relief methods for heel pricks in newborn babies. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n2. **Remove the repetitive sentence in the 'Limitations' section.** The first sentence of this section repeats information already stated in the key messages.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** 'The quality of the evidence about the effectiveness of sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies is not strong, and we need more research to be sure about how well it works and if it is safe.'\n   - **Suggested Action:** Please delete this sentence and begin the section directly with the reasons for the limitations, for example: 'The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes...'\n\n3. **Rephrase the 'Key messages' subheading as a question.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions where possible.\n   - **Problematic subheading:** 'Key messages'\n   - **Suggested Action:** Please change this to 'What are the key messages of this review?'\n\nWhile the draft's sentence-level clarity is excellent (as shown by the high readability scores and low use of passive voice), addressing these structural points will ensure it is complete and fully aligned with Cochrane standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 15 of 18 metrics (83.3%) are in the best quartile for readability and plain language, including excellent readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.99), low passive voice (4 instances), and high use of personal pronouns (22 instances). All metrics fall within or exceed typical ranges, indicating strong sentence-level clarity and style."
