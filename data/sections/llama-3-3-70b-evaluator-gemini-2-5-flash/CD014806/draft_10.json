  "draft": "Is sucrose effective for pain from a heel prick in newborn babies?\nWe wanted to find out if giving sugar to newborn babies reduces pain from a heel prick. A heel prick is a procedure to collect a small blood sample from a baby’s heel.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Sucrose (a type of sugar) probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies during a heel prick compared to giving them nothing.\n- We are not sure if sucrose is better or worse than other pain relief methods like non-nutritive sucking (when a baby sucks on something but does not get any milk) or breastfeeding.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong, and we need more research to be sure about how well sucrose works and if it is safe in the long term.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared giving sucrose to other pain-relieving methods, such as giving water or another sugar (glucose), non-nutritive sucking (letting a baby suck on a pacifier), breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care (placing the baby directly on the parent's chest).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compare giving sucrose with other pain-relief methods for heel pricks in newborn babies. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that sucrose probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies during a heel prick, compared to not giving them anything. However, the evidence was uncertain when comparing sucrose to other methods like breastfeeding. Sucrose seems to work about as well as giving other sugars (like glucose), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022. Researchers need to conduct more studies that compare sugar with other pain relief methods and look at how it affects babies in the long term. This will help doctors and parents choose the safest and most effective ways to comfort babies during medical procedures.",
