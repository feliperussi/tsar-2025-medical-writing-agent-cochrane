  "draft": "# Does giving sucrose (a type of sugar) to newborn babies before a heel prick (a minor painful procedure) help reduce their pain?\n**Key Messages**\n- Sucrose (a type of sugar) probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies when given before a heel prick (a minor painful procedure), but the evidence about its effectiveness compared to other methods of pain relief, such as non-nutritive sucking (when a baby sucks on something but does not get milk, which can be comforting), breastfeeding, or other treatments, is very uncertain.\n- The quality of evidence for the effectiveness of sucrose in reducing pain is generally moderate, meaning that while there is some evidence to support its use, it is not conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness of sucrose to other pain relief methods, and on studying its long-term effects, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare professionals and parents on the best ways to manage pain in newborn babies undergoing minor painful procedures.\n**Introduction**\n### What is sucrose analgesia and why is it used for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nSucrose analgesia refers to the use of sucrose (a type of sugar) to help relieve pain in newborn babies (neonates) during medical procedures, such as heel-lance procedures. Heel-lance procedures involve pricking the heel of a newborn baby to collect a blood sample, which can be painful for the baby. Sucrose analgesia is used to help calm and comfort the baby during this procedure.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about sucrose analgesia for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia in relieving pain from heel-lance procedures in neonates, both in the short-term (immediately after the procedure) and long-term. They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia with other methods of pain relief, such as water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing sucrose to other treatments for pain relief in neonates, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 55 studies that involved 6273 infants. The studies were conducted in various countries and included term and preterm neonates. Most studies investigated the effect of sucrose on pain relief during heel lance procedures, with some also examining other minor painful procedures. The studies compared sucrose to various control treatments, including water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care. The duration of the studies was not specified, but they generally focused on immediate and short-term outcomes. The funding sources for the studies were not explicitly stated in the abstract.\n### Main results: Effectiveness of Sucrose for Pain Relief in Neonates\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in pain scores compared to control, but the effects of sucrose compared to other interventions such as non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, and laser acupuncture are very uncertain. Sucrose may result in little to no difference in pain scores compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin-to-skin care.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues with subheading formatting and significant clarity issues. Two subheadings ('Methods' and 'Main results: Effectiveness of Sucrose for Pain Relief in Neonates') are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory style guide requirement. Additionally, several sentences are excessively long, particularly in the Key Messages, making them difficult to read. The text also contains wordy phrases and repetition, contributing to a high average number of words per sentence and a high noun count. These issues are supported by the PLS evaluation metrics, which show 'words_per_sentence', 'nouns', 'complex_words_dc', and 'long_words' all deviating significantly from typical PLS patterns (P90 range).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features in the best quartile. However, six metrics deviate significantly (P90 range): 'words_per_sentence' (26.70, target <22.1), 'nouns' (198.00, target <116.0), 'lix' (58.45, target <54.3), 'rix' (8.48, target <7.0), 'complex_words_dc' (249.00, target <160.0), and 'long_words' (195.00, target <122.0). These deviations indicate that the text tends to have longer sentences, more nouns, and more complex/long words than typical Plain Language Summaries, impacting readability. To improve, focus on shortening sentences, using more active verbs, and replacing complex vocabulary with simpler alternatives."
