  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) effective for treating painful menstrual cramps?\n\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills, which are medicines that prevent pregnancy) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea, which is cramping in the lower abdomen that happens when a woman has her period), but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (when a woman's period does not follow a regular pattern), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n- The quality of the evidence for these findings is generally good, but there is not enough information to know if one type of combined oral contraceptive pill is better than another for treating painful menstrual cramps, or if they are better than other treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, which are medicines that reduce pain and inflammation).\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for treating painful menstrual cramps, and to compare their benefits and harms to those of other treatments, so that women and their doctors can make informed decisions about the best way to manage this condition.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, also known as painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and safety of these treatments can vary. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are often used to manage dysmenorrhoea, but there is a need to understand their benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea. They wanted to find out how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving quality of life for women with dysmenorrhoea, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use. The authors also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens, and explored the evidence for using OCPs versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of relevant databases for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The combined oral contraceptive pill probably reduces pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo, but it may cause side effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. For every 100 women who use the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with a placebo. The pill may also slightly reduce the need for additional medication and absence from work.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It accurately covers the key findings of the review. My feedback focuses on making the text easier for patients to read by addressing three main areas: sentence length, active voice, and technical language.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Break up long, complex sentences.** Many sentences, especially in the key messages, are very long because they include definitions in parentheses. This makes them hard to follow.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills, which are medicines that prevent pregnancy) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea, which is cramping in the lower abdomen that happens when a woman has her period), but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (when a woman's period does not follow a regular pattern), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** At 68 words, this sentence is too long and asks the reader to process multiple ideas and definitions at once.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Combined oral contraceptive pills (often called 'the pill') are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps. However, they can cause unwanted side effects. These can include irregular bleeding, headaches, and feeling sick to your stomach (nausea).\"\n\n2.  **Use a consistent, active voice.** The text switches between using the third-person \"the review authors\" and the first-person \"we\". The style guide recommends consistently using \"we\". Using a more active voice also makes the text more direct and engaging.\n    *   **Problematic sentences:** \"The review authors aimed to evaluate...\" and \"It is characterized by painful cramps...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Switching from \"the review authors\" to \"we\" can be confusing. The passive phrase \"It is characterized by\" is impersonal and less clear than an active construction.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Change \"The review authors aimed to evaluate...\" to \"We aimed to evaluate...\". Rewrite \"It is characterized by painful cramps...\" as \"This condition causes painful cramps...\"\n\n3.  **Replace technical jargon with simpler terms.** The limitations section uses language directly from a research report that will be unfamiliar to a lay audience.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by... heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"heterogeneity,\" \"participant characteristics,\" and \"intervention delivery methods\" are research jargon and will not be understood by most readers.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because... the studies included different types of women, and the treatments were given in different ways.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much more accessible for your audience. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that sentence length and the use of complex words are significantly higher than in a typical Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns, with 10 of 18 metrics (56%) falling into the P90 range, indicating a need for review. Key areas for improvement are the high average sentence length (26.9 words), high number of passive voice constructions (22), and high counts of complex and long words. While some metrics like pronoun use are good, the overall readability is low, as shown by high scores on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (14.9) and SMOG Index (14.3)."
