  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects like irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n- The quality of the evidence is generally good, but there's not enough information to know if one type of pill is better than another or if they're better than other treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for dysmenorrhoea and compare them directly to other treatments.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, or painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It's characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea. They wanted to determine whether OCPs are effective in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as their potential side effects.\n\nWhat did the researchers do?\nWe searched for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the researchers find?\nThe researchers found that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo. However, they also found that OCPs probably increase the risk of any adverse events, irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n\nWhat about comparing one type of OCP to another?\nThe researchers found that continuous use of OCPs may reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than the standard regimen. However, there's insufficient evidence to determine if one type of OCP is better than another.\n\nWhat about comparing OCPs to NSAIDs?\nThere's insufficient data to determine whether OCPs are more effective than NSAIDs for pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes, lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, combined oral contraceptive pills are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for dysmenorrhoea and compare them directly to other treatments.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft with good readability scores, but it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and impact for the reader. The main issues are an inconsistent point of view, overly generalized results, and some repetition. Addressing these will make the summary much more helpful.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use a consistent and personal voice.** The summary switches between \"we\" and \"the researchers.\" Sticking to \"we\" (as recommended by the style guide) makes the summary more direct and easier to follow.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? ... The researchers found that...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? ... We found that...\"\n\n2. **Make the key findings more specific and meaningful.** The summary states that pills increase the risk of side effects but doesn't explain by how much. Adding a simplified statistic from the original abstract would give readers a clearer picture.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...they also found that OCPs probably increase the risk of any adverse events, irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"However, they also increase the risk of side effects. For example, the evidence shows that for women who have an 18% chance of irregular bleeding without treatment, taking the pill increases that risk to between 39% and 60%.\"\n\n3. **Clarify key terms and remove the repetitive conclusion.** The draft misses an opportunity to define terms like 'nausea' and 'irregular bleeding' for the reader. Additionally, the final paragraph is nearly identical to the first key message and can be removed.\n   - **Problematic Text:** The first key message says: \"...they can cause unwanted effects like irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\" The final paragraph repeats this almost word-for-word.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** In the key messages, add simple definitions: \"...unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in your period), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick).\" Then, delete the final, repetitive paragraph to make the summary more concise.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. All scores are within the expected range, indicating a strong foundation in terms of sentence length, word complexity, and active voice. No metrics show significant deviation."
