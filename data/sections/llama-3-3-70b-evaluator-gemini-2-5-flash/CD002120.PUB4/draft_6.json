  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in your period), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick).\n- We are confident in the evidence that the pill reduces pain, but we are less confident about the evidence for side effects and for comparing different types of pills.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for dysmenorrhoea and compare them directly to other treatments.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, or painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It's characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Painful menstrual cramps are usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to treat painful menstrual cramps. We also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens to find the best treatment options for women with painful menstrual cramps.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials, where treatments are given to people at random. We looked for trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with a placebo (a dummy pill) or other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce painful menstrual cramps in women more effectively than a placebo. However, they also increase the risk of side effects. For example, the evidence shows that for women who have an 18% chance of irregular bleeding without treatment, taking the pill increases that risk to between 39% and 60%. \n\nWhat about comparing one type of OCP to another?\nWe found that continuous use of OCPs may reduce painful menstrual cramps in women more effectively than the standard regimen. However, there's insufficient evidence to determine if one type of OCP is better than another.\n\nWhat about comparing OCPs to NSAIDs?\nThere's insufficient data to determine whether OCPs are more effective than NSAIDs for pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has some limitations. Many studies were small. In some studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting (this is called a 'lack of blinding' and can affect results). The studies also differed in the types of women included and how the treatments were used, which made them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear draft that meets all critical requirements. The following 3 suggestions are aimed at making it even more helpful and accessible for readers.\n\n1. **Clarify what 'confidence in the evidence' means.** Readers may not understand the difference between being 'confident' and 'less confident'. Explaining *why* the confidence level changes helps them better interpret the findings.\n   - **Current text:** 'We are confident in the evidence that the pill reduces pain, but we are less confident about the evidence for side effects and for comparing different types of pills.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'The evidence showing that the pill reduces pain is strong. The evidence for side effects is less certain, mainly because the studies were smaller or designed in ways that could affect the results. This means we are less sure about the exact risk of these side effects.'\n\n2. **Make the 'What did we do?' section more specific.** Adding key numbers from the review gives readers important context about the scale of the research and builds trust.\n   - **Current text:** 'We searched for randomised controlled trials, where treatments are given to people at random. We looked for trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with a placebo (a dummy pill) or other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that randomly assigned women to different treatments. We found 21 such studies, involving a total of 3723 women. We compared their results to understand the benefits and harms of contraceptive pills for painful periods and assessed how reliable the evidence was for each finding.'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language in the 'limitations' section.** This section is crucial for transparency, and using simple, active phrasing makes the limitations easier to understand.\n   - **Current text:** 'In some studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting (this is called a 'lack of blinding' and can affect results). The studies also differed in the types of women included and how the treatments were used, which made them difficult to compare.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'The evidence has some limitations. In some studies, women knew which treatment they were getting, which can influence the results. Also, the studies included different types of women and used the pills in different ways, making it hard to compare their findings directly.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and style. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.87) are excellent. However, the passive voice count (15 instances) is in the upper range of what's typical (P75), which supports the need for more direct, active phrasing in some sections to improve clarity."
