  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps?\n\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills, often called \"the pill,\" are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps. However, they can cause unwanted side effects. These can include irregular bleeding, headaches, and feeling sick to your stomach (nausea).\n- The quality of the evidence for these findings is generally good. But there is not enough information to know if one type of combined oral contraceptive pill is better than another for treating painful menstrual cramps. It's also unclear if they are better than other treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are medicines that reduce pain and inflammation.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for treating painful menstrual cramps. This will help compare their benefits and harms to those of other treatments. With this information, women and their doctors can make informed decisions about the best way to manage this condition.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, also known as painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue. It causes painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. We usually treat dysmenorrhoea with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives. But the effectiveness and safety of these treatments can vary. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are often used to manage dysmenorrhoea. However, there is a need to understand their benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea. We wanted to find out how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving quality of life for women with dysmenorrhoea. We also looked at the potential risks and side effects associated with their use. Additionally, we compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens. We explored the evidence for using OCPs versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of relevant databases for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The combined oral contraceptive pill probably reduces pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo. But it may cause side effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. For every 100 women who use the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain. This is compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with a placebo. The pill may also slightly reduce the need for additional medication and absence from work.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies included different types of women, and the treatments were given in different ways. Some studies had very small sample sizes, and participants may have known their treatment. Also, not all outcomes were fully reported.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

This is supported by the high number of complex and long words found in the analysis.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea.\"\n    *   **Try:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using 'the pill' to manage painful menstrual cramps.\"\n\n2. **Use the active voice to make it clear who is doing what.** The summary has a high number of passive sentences, which can be confusing. The style guide ...\n    *   **Instead of:** \"...the treatments were given in different ways.\"\n    *   **Try:** \"...researchers gave the treatments in different ways.\"\n    *   **Instead of:** \"Also, not all outcomes were fully reported.\"\n    *   **Try:** \"Also, researchers did not always report all their findings.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent, plain language terminology.** The summary introduces 'dysmenorrhoea' but then switches between this term, 'primary dysmenorrhoea', and 'painful menstrual cramps'. For clarity, please define the technical term once and then use the plain language term ('painful menstrual cramps') consistently throughout the rest of the text.\n    *   **For example:** In the 'What did we want to find out?' section, change 'primary dysmenorrhoea' and 'dysmenorrhoea' to 'painful menstrual cramps'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns overall, with 12 of 18 metrics (67%) falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis flags five key metrics for review, all of which are in the P90 range, indicating significant deviation from typical PLS vocabulary and sentence structure. These are: passive_voice (21 instances), smog_index (14.05), complex_words_dc (218), complex_words (116), and long_words (166). This pattern suggests that while sentence length is good, the vocabulary is too complex and the sentence structure is not direct enough for a lay audience, supporting the need for the recommended edits."
