  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in your period), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick).\n- The quality of the evidence is generally good. However, we don't have enough information to know if one type of pill is better than another. We also couldn't tell if the pill is better than other treatments, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for dysmenorrhoea and compare them directly to other treatments.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, or painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It's characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to treat painful period cramps. We also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens to find the best treatment options for women with dysmenorrhoea.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo. However, they also increase the risk of side effects. For example, the evidence shows that for women who have an 18% chance of irregular bleeding without treatment, taking the pill increases that risk to between 39% and 60%. \n\nWhat about comparing one type of OCP to another?\nWe found that continuous use of OCPs may reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than the standard regimen. However, there's insufficient evidence to determine if one type of OCP is better than another.\n\nWhat about comparing OCPs to NSAIDs?\nThere's insufficient data to determine whether OCPs are more effective than NSAIDs for pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has some limitations. Many studies were small, and in some, the women knew which treatment they were getting (which can affect results). Also, the studies were different from each other in ways that made them hard to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-written draft that is easy to read. However, it is not approved because it needs three key improvements to ensure patients can fully understand the information. 1. **Define the intervention for the reader:** The summary never explains what a 'combined oral contraceptive pill' is. Please add a simple definition, like '(a birth control pill containing two hormones)', which is crucial context for a lay audience. A good place would be the first key message: 'Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills containing two hormones) are effective...'. 2. **Clarify the quality of the evidence:** The statement 'The quality of the evidence is generally good' is too simple and masks important nuances from the original abstract, which reports a mix of high, moderate, and low-quality evidence. Please be more specific to build trust. For example: 'We are confident in the evidence that the pill reduces pain, but we are less confident about the evidence for side effects and for comparing different types of pills.' 3. **Use consistent terminology for the condition:** The summary switches between 'dysmenorrhoea', 'painful menstrual cramps', and 'painful period cramps'. For clarity, please define the term once (as you do in the title and first section) and then stick to one plain language phrase (e.g., 'painful period cramps') throughout the rest of the text. For example, in the 'What did we find?' section, change '...reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea...' to '...reduce painful period cramps...'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 78% of metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and clarity, including excellent scores for sentence length (words_per_sentence: 15.97), passive voice (9 instances), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.11). The metrics indicate a very strong stylistic foundation. The recommended edits focus on content and context—such as defining key terms and adding nuance—which are not captured by these statistical measures."
