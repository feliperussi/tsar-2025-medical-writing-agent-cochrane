  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in your period), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick).\n- The quality of the evidence is generally good, but there's not enough information to know if one type of pill is better than another or if they're better than other treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, a type of pain reliever).\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for dysmenorrhoea and compare them directly to other treatments.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, or painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It's characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea. We wanted to determine whether OCPs are effective in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as their potential side effects, such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo. However, they also increase the risk of side effects. For example, the evidence shows that for women who have an 18% chance of irregular bleeding without treatment, taking the pill increases that risk to between 39% and 60%. \n\nWhat about comparing one type of OCP to another?\nWe found that continuous use of OCPs may reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than the standard regimen. However, there's insufficient evidence to determine if one type of OCP is better than another.\n\nWhat about comparing OCPs to NSAIDs?\nThere's insufficient data to determine whether OCPs are more effective than NSAIDs for pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes, lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. The feedback below is focused on refining a few key areas to make the text even clearer for a lay audience. The main reason for this 'NOT_APPROVED' grade is the use of unexplained technical terms in the limitations section, which could confuse readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain technical terms in the 'Limitations' section.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by small sample sizes, lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'blinding' and 'heterogeneity' are research jargon and will be unfamiliar to most readers. This sentence lists limitations without explaining what they actually mean.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence has some limitations. Many studies were small, and in some, the women knew which treatment they were getting (which can affect results). Also, the studies were different from each other in ways that made them hard to compare.\"\n\n2. **Simplify formal language in the aims section.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is too academic. Words like 'assess' and 'management' can be replaced with simpler, more direct alternatives.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to treat painful period cramps.\"\n\n3. **Break up long sentences in the key messages for better readability.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The quality of the evidence is generally good, but there's not enough information to know if one type of pill is better than another or if they're better than other treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, a type of pain reliever).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines two separate ideas (comparing pills to each other, and comparing pills to other drugs), making it long and a bit complex.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The quality of the evidence is generally good. However, we don't have enough information to know if one type of pill is better than another. We also couldn't tell if the pill is better than other treatments, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, showing the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 78% of metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and simplicity, including strong scores for sentence length (17.8 words/sentence) and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (10.3). No metrics show significant deviation from the norm, indicating a solid structural and linguistic foundation. The feedback provided focuses on refining specific word choices and explaining technical terms rather than addressing broad metric-based issues."
