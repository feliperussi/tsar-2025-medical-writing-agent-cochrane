It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and safety of these treatments can vary. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are often used to manage dysmenorrhoea, but there is a need to understand their benefits and harms.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea. They wanted to find out how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving quality of life for women with dysmenorrhoea, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use. The authors also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens, and explored the evidence for using OCPs versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating dysmenorrhoea.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of relevant databases for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nWe extracted outcome data from the identified studies, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using a predefined assessment framework.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The combined oral contraceptive pill probably reduces pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo, but it may cause side effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. For every 100 women who use the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with a placebo. The pill may also slightly reduce the need for additional medication and absence from work.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED primarily due to critical issues with subheading formatting and significant clarity and readability problems. Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains overly long and complex sentences, uses too much passive voice, and relies on complex vocabulary and nominalizations, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the text deviates significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns across most readability and complexity metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. While the word count is within limits, the text shows lower readability (Flesch Reading Ease P25) and higher complexity across almost all other metrics (13 out of 18 features are in the P90 range). Specifically, sentence length (words_per_sentence 27.3), passive voice (23 instances), nominalization (21 instances), and overall vocabulary complexity (complex_words_dc 253, complex_words 133, long_words 196) are considerably higher than typical PLS texts. This suggests the text is much harder to read and understand for a lay audience than intended."
