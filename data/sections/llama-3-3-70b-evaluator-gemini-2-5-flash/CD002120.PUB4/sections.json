  "key_messages": [
    "Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills, which are medicines that prevent pregnancy) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea, which is cramping in the lower abdomen that happens when a woman has her period), but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (when a woman's period does not follow a regular pattern), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).",
    "The quality of the evidence for these findings is generally good, but there is not enough information to know if one type of combined oral contraceptive pill is better than another for treating painful menstrual cramps, or if they are better than other treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, which are medicines that reduce pain and inflammation).",
    "More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for treating painful menstrual cramps, and to compare their benefits and harms to those of other treatments, so that women and their doctors can make informed decisions about the best way to manage this condition."

      "subheading": "What is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Dysmenorrhoea, also known as painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and safety of these treatments can vary. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are often used to manage dysmenorrhoea, but there is a need to understand their benefits and harms."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea. They wanted to find out how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving quality of life for women with dysmenorrhoea, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use. The authors also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens, and explored the evidence for using OCPs versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating dysmenorrhoea."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The combined oral contraceptive pill probably reduces pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than a placebo, but it may cause side effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. For every 100 women who use the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with a placebo. The pill may also slightly reduce the need for additional medication and absence from work."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.",
