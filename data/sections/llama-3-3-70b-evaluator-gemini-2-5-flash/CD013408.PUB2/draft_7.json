  "draft": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation probably reduce deaths from any cause compared to usual care.\n- These services probably make little to no difference to the number of people hospitalised for any reason, but they do reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits or harms, so more research is needed.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults where the heart beats irregularly (an irregular heartbeat). It requires careful management. If not managed properly, AF can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems. Common treatments include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, and procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. We aimed to find out if organised clinical services, like collaborative and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing deaths and hospital stays.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing organised clinical service models for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, summarised their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. Researchers conducted these studies in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies compared organised care services—such as care led by a nurse-led team or provided through digital health apps—to usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nOur main results came from evidence of high, moderate, or low certainty:\n- High-certainty evidence shows that organised care services reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- Moderate-certainty evidence suggests these services probably greatly reduce deaths from any cause, but probably make little to no difference to hospital stays for any reason.\n- Low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain about the effects on other outcomes, such as deaths from heart-related problems, stroke, or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022 and for ongoing trials up to April 2023.\n\nFuture studies should investigate how organised care services affect people long-term. They should also measure how these services impact people's quality of life. This will provide more reliable evidence to help people and their doctors decide on the best care.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for patients before it can be approved. The main issues are a key factual omission in the 'Key messages' section and the use of formal, noun-heavy language in a few places. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) compared to typical summaries. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer and more helpful for readers.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Add the missing finding about harms to the Key Messages.**\n\nYour third key message currently says: \"The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits or harms, so more research is needed.\"\n\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This omits an important finding for patients. The source material states, \"no harmful effects were reported in the review.\" Knowing that no harms were found is a key piece of information for decision-making.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits, but the studies **did not report any harmful effects**. More research is needed.\"\n\n**2. Use more direct, active verbs instead of formal nouns.**\n\nIn the section 'What is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?', the language is a bit abstract.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"It requires careful management. If not managed properly, AF can lead to serious complications... Common treatments include medications... and procedures...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"requires management\" and \"common treatments include\" are noun-heavy and less direct. Using active verbs makes the information easier to understand.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"People with AF **need to manage** their condition carefully. If they don't, it can lead to serious complications... Doctors commonly **treat** AF with medicines... or with procedures...\"\n\n**3. Make the main results easier to scan and understand.**\n\nThe results section starts with a sentence that slows the reader down before getting to the key findings.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"Our main results came from evidence of high, moderate, or low certainty:\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is unnecessary and creates a barrier to the important information in the bullet points. It's better to remove it and let the clear, direct bullet points stand on their own.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** Simply delete that introductory sentence and begin the section with the first bullet point: \"- High-certainty evidence shows that organised care services reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis identified two metrics that deviate from the typical pattern: 'passive_voice' (21 instances) and 'nominalization' (24 instances), both falling in the P90 range. This suggests the text relies more heavily on formal, noun-based phrases and passive constructions than a typical PLS, which supports the editorial recommendation to rewrite key sentences using more direct, active verbs."
