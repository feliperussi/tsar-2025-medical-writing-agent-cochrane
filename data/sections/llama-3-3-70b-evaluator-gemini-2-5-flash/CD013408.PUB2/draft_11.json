It is considered a complex cardiovascular condition that requires careful management. As the prevalence of AF increases, there is a growing need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. The condition can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems if not managed properly. Common treatments for AF include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, as well as procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation, compared to usual care. They aimed to find out whether organised clinical services, such as collaborative, multidisciplinary, and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing the risk of death, hospitalisation, and other complications. The authors also wanted to examine the effectiveness of these models in reducing the burden of AF on individuals and the healthcare system.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing organized clinical services to usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse-led multidisciplinary approach or management using mHealth compared to usual care. There is no information available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. The population characteristics and study settings are varied, with different countries and healthcare systems represented. The types of interventions and comparisons also vary, with a focus on collaborative, multidisciplinary care and virtual care. No studies were found that reported on minor cerebrovascular events.\n### Main results: Reduction in mortality and hospitalisation\nOrganised clinical services for adults with atrial fibrillation probably result in a large reduction in all-cause mortality. Organised clinical services probably make little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation. Organised clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but they do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation. Organised clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants (or investigators) may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory requirement for patient engagement and readability. Additionally, the text exhibits significant issues with clarity and conciseness, marked by excessive passive voice, nominalization, and dense paragraphs, contributing to higher-than-typical vocabulary complexity. These issues collectively hinder the readability and accessibility of the Plain Language Summary for its intended audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling within the best quartile. However, a notable number of metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns. Specifically, the `smog_index` (15.45), `complex_words` (156.00), `long_words` (213.00), and `nominalization` (36.00) are all rated 'BEYOND_P90', indicating that the text is considerably more complex than typical PLS documents in terms of vocabulary and sentence structure. Furthermore, `passive_voice` (23.00), `nouns` (191.00), and `complex_words_dc` (273.00) are in the 'P90' range, suggesting a higher prevalence of passive constructions, noun-heavy phrasing, and unfamiliar words. These deviations collectively point to a need for simplification and more direct language to enhance readability."
