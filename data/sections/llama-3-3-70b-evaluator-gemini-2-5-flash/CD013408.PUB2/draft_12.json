  "draft": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\n\nWe looked at studies that compared organised care services to usual care for people with atrial fibrillation. Organised care services involve a team of healthcare professionals working together. \n\n- Organised care services probably reduce deaths from all causes for people with atrial fibrillation, but may make little to no difference to hospital stays.\n- The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the effects of organised care services on some outcomes, such as stroke or major bleeding events.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of different models of organised care, including the use of digital health technologies, to better understand what works best for people with atrial fibrillation.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?\nAtrial fibrillation, or AF, is a common heart condition where the heart beats irregularly. It requires careful management to prevent serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems. As more people develop AF, there's a growing need to improve care for those living with it.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know if organised clinical services, such as collaborative and multidisciplinary care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF. They aimed to find out if these services reduce the risk of death, hospitalisation, and other complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. These studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared organised care services, including nurse-led multidisciplinary approaches and management using digital health technologies, to usual care.\n\nMain results: Reduction in mortality and hospitalisation\nOrganised care services probably result in a large reduction in deaths from all causes. However, they may make little to no difference to hospital stays. Organised care services may reduce hospitalisations due to heart problems but may not reduce deaths from heart problems. They may also make little to no difference to stroke or major bleeding events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which could introduce bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to October 2022.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, particularly readability. All readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, etc.) are in the best quartile (P25), indicating the text is easy to read in terms of sentence length and word complexity. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs) is in the 90th percentile with 23 instances, well above the typical median of less than 13. This suggests the text could be made more direct and active by converting these nouns back into verbs."
