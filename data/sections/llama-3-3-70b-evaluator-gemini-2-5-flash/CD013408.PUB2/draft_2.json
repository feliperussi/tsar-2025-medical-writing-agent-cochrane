  "draft": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\n\nWe looked at how organised care services, where a team of healthcare professionals work together, affect people with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat. \n\n- Organised care services probably reduce deaths from all causes for people with atrial fibrillation, but may make little to no difference to hospital stays. \n- The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the benefits and harms of organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation. \n- More research is needed to understand how different models of care organisation can affect outcomes.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?\nAtrial fibrillation, or AF, is a common heart rhythm condition in adults where the heart beats irregularly. It requires careful management. If not managed properly, AF can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems. Common treatments include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, and procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. They aimed to find out if organised clinical services, like collaborative and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing deaths and hospital stays.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared organised care services, such as nurse-led multidisciplinary approaches or management using digital health technologies, to usual care.\n\nMain results: Reduction in mortality and hospitalization\nOrganised care services probably cause a large reduction in deaths from all causes. They probably make little to no difference to hospital stays. Organised care services may reduce hospital stays due to heart problems but may not reduce deaths from heart problems. They may make little to no difference to complications like stroke.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which could introduce bias.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFuture studies should investigate the long-term effects of organised care services, compare different models of care organisation, and examine the impact on quality of life and other important outcomes for people with atrial fibrillation. This will provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved because it has critical factual errors and does not follow the required structure. Here are the 4 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the search date.** The currency statement is factually incorrect and incomplete, which can mislead the reader.\n- **Problem:** The draft states, \"The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\"\n- **Reason:** The original abstract clearly states that trial registries were searched until April 2023. This later date must be included.\n- **Suggestion:** Please change the sentence to: \"We searched for studies up to October 2022 and for ongoing trials up to April 2023.\"\n\n2. **Add the missing 'Methods' section and format all subheadings as questions.** The draft is missing a required section, and several subheadings do not follow the style guide, which disrupts the flow and readability for the user.\n- **Problem:** There is no section explaining how the review was done. The subheadings \"Main results: Reduction in mortality and hospitalization\", \"Limitations\", and \"Currency\" are not questions.\n- **Suggestion:** Please add a new section before \"What did we find?\" with the subheading \"How did we conduct this review?\" and the text: \"We searched for studies comparing organized clinical service models for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\" Please also change the other subheadings to: \"What were the main results?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n3. **Use more direct, verb-focused language.** The text often uses nouns where verbs would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences more abstract and harder to understand.\n- **Problem:** \"Organised care services probably cause a large reduction in deaths from all causes.\"\n- **Reason:** The phrase \"cause a large reduction\" is a nominalization, using a noun (\"reduction\") instead of a direct verb. This is less active and engaging for the reader.\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite this to use a direct verb: \"Organised care services probably greatly reduce deaths from all causes.\"\n\n4. **State the certainty of evidence more accurately in the results.** The draft understates the certainty for a key finding, which misrepresents the review's conclusions.\n- **Problem:** The draft says, \"Organised care services may reduce hospital stays due to heart problems...\"\n- **Reason:** The original abstract states this finding is based on \"high certainty evidence.\" The word \"may\" implies low certainty and does not accurately reflect the confidence in this result.\n- **Suggestion:** Please change this to be more precise: \"We are very certain that organised care services reduce hospital stays due to heart problems.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good structural readability, with most metrics like sentence length (16.4 words) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.95) falling within the best quartile for PLS texts. However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which scored in the 90th percentile. This metric supports the editorial feedback to use more direct, active verbs to improve clarity and engagement."
