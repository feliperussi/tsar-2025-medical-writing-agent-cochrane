  "draft": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care? We looked at how organised care services, where a team of healthcare professionals work together, affect people with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat. Organised care services probably greatly reduce deaths from all causes for people with atrial fibrillation, but probably make little to no difference to hospital stays. The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the benefits and harms of organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation. More research is needed to understand how different models of care organisation can affect outcomes.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem? Atrial fibrillation, or AF, is a common heart rhythm condition in adults where the heart beats irregularly. It requires careful management. If not managed properly, AF can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems. Common treatments include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, and procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? The authors wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. They aimed to find out if organised clinical services, like collaborative and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing deaths and hospital stays.\n\nHow did we conduct this review? We searched for studies comparing organised clinical service models for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? We found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared organised care services, such as nurse-led multidisciplinary approaches or management using digital health technologies, to usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results? Organised care services probably greatly reduce deaths from all causes. They probably make little to no difference to hospital stays. We are very certain that organised care services reduce hospital stays due to heart problems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited because the studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which could introduce bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? We searched for studies up to October 2022 and for ongoing trials up to April 2023.\n\nFuture studies should investigate the long-term effects of organised care services, compare different models of care organisation, and examine the impact on quality of life and other important outcomes for people with atrial fibrillation. This will provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It has a strong foundation with good readability scores, but it fails on two critical checks: it is missing the required 'Key Messages' section and contains contradictory statements about the certainty of the evidence. Additionally, several sentences could be clearer and more direct.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Add a 'Key Messages' Section**\n\n*   **Problem:** The summary is missing the required 'Key Messages' section at the beginning. This section is crucial for readers who want the main takeaways quickly.\n*   **Suggestion:** Create a new section called 'Key messages' right after the title. Use the information from the first paragraph and the `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` to create a bulleted list of the 2-3 most important findings. For example:\n    *   'Organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat) probably reduce deaths from any cause compared to usual care.'\n    *   'These services probably make little to no difference to the number of people hospitalized for any reason, but they do reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.'\n    *   'The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits or harms, so more research is needed.'\n\n**2. Resolve Contradictory Statements on Evidence Certainty**\n\n*   **Problem:** The text makes conflicting claims about the quality of the evidence, which will confuse readers.\n*   **Quote:**\n    *   In the introduction: 'The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the benefits and harms of organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation.'\n    *   In the results: 'We are very certain that organised care services reduce hospital stays due to heart problems.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Revise the introductory summary to reflect the mixed certainty of the evidence. The statement in the introduction is too broad and clashes with the specific, high-certainty finding in the results. The key messages should clarify that our confidence in the evidence varies depending on the specific outcome.\n\n**3. Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Forms (Nominalizations)**\n\n*   **Problem:** Some sentences are unnecessarily complex because they use nouns to describe actions, rather than using verbs directly. This makes the text less engaging and harder to read.\n*   **Quote:** 'This will provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Rewrite the sentence to use active verbs. For example:\n    *   'This will provide more reliable evidence so people can make better decisions.'\n*   **Supporting Evidence:** This issue is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found the use of 'nominalization' (noun forms of verbs) was higher than in 90% of typical Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows high conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in two areas of vocabulary complexity. The count of 'nominalization' (26) and 'complex_words' (117) are in the P90 range, indicating the text relies more heavily on noun forms of verbs and words with 3+ syllables than is typical for a PLS. Addressing these vocabulary issues will improve clarity."
