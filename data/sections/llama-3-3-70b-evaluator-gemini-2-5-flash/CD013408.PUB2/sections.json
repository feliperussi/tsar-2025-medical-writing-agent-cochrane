  "key_messages": [
    "Organised care services (where a team of healthcare professionals work together) for people with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) probably reduce deaths (all-cause mortality) compared to usual care, but may make little to no difference to hospital stays (all-cause hospitalisation), with no reported harmful effects.",
    "The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the effects of organised care services on some outcomes, such as stroke (thromboembolic complications) or major bleeding events, highlighting the need for more research in this area.",
    "Future studies should investigate the effects of different models of organised care, including the use of digital health technologies (mHealth), to better understand what works best for people with atrial fibrillation and to address the current limitations in the evidence."

      "subheading": "What is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults, where the heart beats irregularly. It is considered a complex cardiovascular condition that requires careful management. As the prevalence of AF increases, there is a growing need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. The condition can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems if not managed properly. Common treatments for AF include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, as well as procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation, compared to usual care. They aimed to find out whether organised clinical services, such as collaborative, multidisciplinary, and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing the risk of death, hospitalisation, and other complications. The authors also wanted to examine the effectiveness of these models in reducing the burden of AF on individuals and the healthcare system."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 8 studies that involved 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse-led multidisciplinary approach or management using mHealth compared to usual care. There is no information available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. The population characteristics and study settings are varied, with different countries and healthcare systems represented. The types of interventions and comparisons also vary, with a focus on collaborative, multidisciplinary care and virtual care. No studies were found that reported on minor cerebrovascular events."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Reduction in mortality and hospitalisation",
      "content": "Organised clinical services for adults with atrial fibrillation probably result in a large reduction in all-cause mortality. Organised clinical services probably make little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation. Organised clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but they do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation. Organised clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants (or investigators) may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.",
