  "draft": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation probably reduce deaths from any cause compared to usual care.\n- These services probably make little to no difference to the number of people hospitalised for any reason, but they do reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits, but the studies did not report any harmful effects. More research is needed.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults where the heart beats irregularly (an irregular heartbeat). People with AF need to manage their condition carefully. If they don't, it can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems. Doctors commonly treat AF with medicines to control heart rate and rhythm, or with procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. We aimed to find out if organised clinical services, like collaborative and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing deaths and hospital stays.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing organised clinical service models for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, summarised their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. Researchers conducted these studies in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies compared organised care services—such as care led by a nurse-led team or provided through digital health apps—to usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n- High-certainty evidence shows that organised care services reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- Moderate-certainty evidence suggests these services probably greatly reduce deaths from any cause, but probably make little to no difference to hospital stays for any reason.\n- Low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain about the effects on other outcomes, such as deaths from heart-related problems, stroke, or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022 and for ongoing trials up to April 2023.\n\nFuture studies should investigate how organised care services affect people long-term. They should also measure how these services impact people's quality of life. This will provide more reliable evidence to help people and their doctors decide on the best care.\n\nWhat's next?\nMore research is needed to confirm the benefits and harms of organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation. Future studies should compare different models of care organisation, including the use of digital health technologies, and examine the impact on quality of life and other important outcomes. This will help us understand how to deliver the best possible care for people with AF.",

However, it needs revisions to reduce its formal, academic tone and make it more accessible for a lay audience. The language is more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify complex and formal vocabulary.** The text uses words that are common in research but may be unfamiliar to patients. This is supported by the high scores for complex and long words.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"If they don't, it can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The word \"complications\" is medical jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"If not managed well, it can lead to serious problems like stroke, heart failure, and other heart conditions.\"\n   - **Another example:** Replace \"investigate\" with \"look at\" or \"study\".\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations).** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences less direct and harder to read. The high `nominalization` score reflects this pattern.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Assess the effects of\" is a wordy, noun-based phrase. \"Clinical service organisations\" is a dense noun cluster.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how different ways of organising clinical services affect adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the description of the interventions.** The explanation of what 'organised care' means could be clearer for someone unfamiliar with the term.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies compared organised care services—such as care led by a nurse-led team or provided through digital health apps—to usual care.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Care led by a nurse-led team\" is a bit clunky.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared organised care services to usual care. These services included care coordinated by a team of nurses or support provided through digital health apps on a phone or tablet.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and structure, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and style. Six metrics are in the P90 range, including passive_voice (22), nominalization (25), complex_words (118), and long_words (166). This indicates the language is more formal and academic than is typical for a PLS, supporting the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence constructions."
