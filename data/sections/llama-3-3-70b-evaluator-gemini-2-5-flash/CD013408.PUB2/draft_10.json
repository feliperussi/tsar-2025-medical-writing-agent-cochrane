  "draft": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation probably reduce deaths from any cause compared to usual care.\n- These services probably make little to no difference to the number of people hospitalised for any reason, but they do reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits, but the studies did not report any harmful effects. More research is needed.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults where the heart beats irregularly - this is also known as an irregular heartbeat. People with AF need to manage their condition carefully. If they don't, it can lead to serious problems like stroke, heart failure, and other heart conditions. Doctors commonly treat AF with medicines to control heart rate and rhythm, or with procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of organising clinical services affect adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. We looked at whether organised clinical services, like collaborative and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing deaths and hospital stays.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing organised clinical service models for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, summarised their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The studies compared organised care services - such as care coordinated by a team of nurses or support provided through digital health apps on a phone or tablet - to usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n- Organised care services reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- Organised care services probably greatly reduce deaths from any cause, but probably make little to no difference to hospital stays for any reason.\n- We are uncertain about the effects on other outcomes, such as deaths from heart-related problems, stroke, or major bleeding, because the evidence is not strong enough.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022 and for ongoing trials up to April 2023.\n\nFuture studies should look at how organised care services affect people long-term. They should also measure how these services impact people's quality of life. This will provide more reliable evidence to help people and their doctors decide on the best care.\n\nWhat's next?\nMore research is needed to confirm the benefits and harms of organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation. Future studies should compare different models of care organisation, including the use of digital health technologies, and examine the impact on quality of life and other important outcomes. This will help us understand how to deliver the best possible care for people with AF.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate, well-organized, and meets the word count. The readability scores are excellent. I have three main suggestions to make the summary even clearer and more helpful for readers before it can be approved.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Add back the helpful plain language definitions.**\n\nThe draft removed the simple explanations for key terms that were in the source material. These definitions are crucial for helping a lay audience understand the topic from the very beginning.\n\n- **Problematic Text (Title):** \"Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** A reader may not know what \"atrial fibrillation\" or \"organised care services\" are. The original source provided simple, parenthetical definitions that should be included.\n- **Suggested Rewrite (Title):** \"Do organised care services (where a team of healthcare professionals work together) reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) compared to usual care?\"\n- **Further Suggestion:** Briefly define these terms again in the main text, for example: \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition where the heart beats irregularly...\" and \"We looked at organised care services, where a team of healthcare professionals work together to manage a person's care...\"\n\n**2. Combine the repetitive final sections.**\n\nThe summary ends with two sections that say very similar things. This can feel repetitive and confusing for the reader.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** The last two paragraphs, starting with \"Future studies should look at...\" and \"What's next? More research is needed...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Both sections call for more research, mention quality of life, and discuss future directions. Combining them makes the conclusion stronger and more concise.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Merge the two sections under the single heading \"What's next?\"\n  > **What's next?**\n  > More research is needed to confirm the long-term benefits and harms of organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation. Future studies should compare different types of organised care, including the use of digital health apps. It is also important for studies to measure how these services affect people's quality of life. This will provide more reliable evidence to help people and their doctors decide on the best care.\n\n**3. Use more direct and active language to improve clarity.**\n\nThe draft sometimes uses passive or indirect phrasing that can make it harder to understand who is doing what. Using more active verbs makes the writing clearer and more engaging.\n\n- **Problematic Text (from 'Limitations'):** \"Also, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"could have biased the results\" is passive and a bit vague. It's not clear who might have been biased (the participants, the researchers, or both).\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Also, people in the studies and the researchers knew which treatment each person received. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\"\n\nThis is part of a broader pattern in the draft. Focusing on using active verbs (e.g., \"researchers found\" instead of \"it was found\") will make the entire summary easier to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with excellent readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.88) and good sentence length (17.7 words/sentence), placing it in the best quartile for 83% of features. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate significantly from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (23 instances), nominalization (23 instances), and nouns (166 instances) are all in the P90 range, meaning they are higher than is typical. This statistical finding supports the editorial feedback to use more active, verb-driven language to improve clarity."
