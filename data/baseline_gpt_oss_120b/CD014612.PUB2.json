    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDoes closing the internal space (mesenteric defect) during gastric‑bypass surgery reduce the chance of an internal hernia?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Closing the mesenteric defect may lower the risk of an internal hernia that can block the bowel, but we have little confidence in this finding because only a few small studies looked at it.  \n- Closing the defect probably does not change the overall rate of complications after surgery, the chance of dying within a month, or the number of problems that happen during the operation. The evidence for these outcomes is also uncertain.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to know for sure whether closing the defect is helpful or harmful.\n\nWhat is the health problem and why does it matter?  \nWhat is Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and internal hernia?  \nRoux‑en‑Y gastric bypass is a type of weight‑loss surgery where the stomach is made smaller and the small intestine is rearranged. After this rearrangement, a small opening called a mesenteric defect can be left behind. If loops of intestine slip through this opening, an internal hernia can form. An internal hernia can block the bowel and become a life‑threatening emergency.\n\nWhy might surgeons close the defect?  \nSome surgeons stitch the opening closed (defect closure) hoping to stop internal hernias. However, stitching could also cause the intestine to kink, leading to a blockage (small‑bowel obstruction). We do not know which approach is safer.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to learn whether closing the mesenteric defect reduces internal hernias and whether it changes other important outcomes such as early complications, death within 30 days, problems during the operation, length of hospital stay, and pain after surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared closing the defect with leaving it open in people with obesity who had RYGB. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three studies that together included about 3,000 people who had RYGB. The studies were done in different countries and used either non‑absorbable stitches placed one at a time or a running stitch to close the defect. The follow‑up periods varied, with some outcomes measured up to 10 years after surgery.\n\n- Closing the defect may cause a large reduction in the chance of an internal hernia that blocks the bowel, but we have little confidence in this result because only a few small studies examined it.  \n- Closing the defect probably makes little or no difference to the overall rate of complications within the first month after surgery.  \n- Closing the defect probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying within the first month after surgery.  \n- Closing the defect probably makes little or no difference to the number of problems that happen during the operation.  \n- It is unclear if closing the defect changes how long people stay in the hospital after surgery.  \n- There was not enough information to say anything about pain after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were few, involved relatively small numbers of people, and some may have had problems with how they were carried out (for example, people might have known which treatment they received). These issues make it hard to be sure about the true effects of closing the defect.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024."
