    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs lying face‑down after eye surgery helpful for preventing retinal problems (retinal displacement) in people with a macula‑involving retinal detachment?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Very low‑certainty evidence suggests that lying face‑down right after surgery may lower the chance of the retina shifting, of outer retinal folds, and of double vision, but it might also raise the risk of higher eye pressure; the evidence is too uncertain to be sure about any of these effects.  \n- The same low‑certainty evidence shows no clear difference in how well people see (visual acuity) or in visual distortion when they lie face‑down compared with other positions.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to find out whether face‑down positioning truly helps, what side‑effects it may cause, and how it affects quality of life.  \n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment?  \nA macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is an eye emergency where the thin layer at the back of the eye pulls away from its normal place, and the central part of vision (the macula) is affected. This can lead to sudden loss of sharp vision and may cause long‑term visual problems if not repaired quickly.  \n\nWhy might face‑down positioning matter after surgery?  \nSurgeons often repair this condition with a procedure called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) that uses a gas bubble to hold the retina in place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay face‑down for a period after the operation because they think the gas bubble will press the retina back into place better, possibly reducing the chance that the retina shifts (retinal displacement) after surgery. Retinal displacement can cause wavy vision (metamorphopsia) and double vision (binocular diplopia).  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether staying face‑down right after PPV with a gas bubble reduces the risk of retinal displacement compared with other post‑surgery positions, and whether it changes vision quality, visual distortion, quality of life, or causes any eye‑related side‑effects.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched multiple medical databases for studies that compared face‑down positioning with other positions after PPV and gas tamponade. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found three studies that together included about 370 eyes from 368 people who had a macula‑involving retinal detachment. Most participants were men, and the studies were carried out in different countries. The surgeries used a gas bubble, and the face‑down position was started immediately after the operation. One study also reported funding sources and was registered in a trial database.  \n\nMain results  \n- It is unclear if face‑down positioning reduces retinal displacement after surgery.  \n- It is unclear if face‑down positioning reduces outer retinal folds (a type of eye surface wrinkle) after surgery.  \n- It is unclear if face‑down positioning reduces double vision after surgery.  \n- It is unclear if face‑down positioning changes the chance of higher eye pressure after surgery.  \n- Face‑down positioning probably makes little or no difference to how well people see (visual acuity) three months after surgery.  \n- Face‑down positioning probably makes little or no difference to visual distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores around six months after surgery.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and there were only a few of them, which makes it hard to be sure about the results.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022."
