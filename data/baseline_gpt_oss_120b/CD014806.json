    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs giving sugar water (sucrose) helpful for easing the pain of heel‑lance in newborn babies?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Giving a small amount of sugar water probably lowers the pain scores that babies show right after a heel‑lance, compared with giving no treatment or plain water; no serious side‑effects were reported.  \n- Adding sugar water to other soothing methods such as non‑nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, or skin‑to‑skin care shows unclear benefit, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- More well‑designed studies are needed because many of the existing trials were small, varied a lot, and did not always hide which treatment was given, so we cannot be sure about the true effects.\n\nWhat is the problem?  \nWhat is a heel‑lance and why does it matter?  \nA heel‑lance is a quick prick of the baby’s heel that doctors use to collect a tiny drop of blood for testing. The procedure can cause a sharp, short‑lasting pain for newborns, both full‑term and pre‑term. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, clinicians use special pain scores (such as the Premature Infant Pain Profile, PIPP) to estimate how much pain a baby shows.\n\nWhat are the usual ways to calm babies during this test?  \nParents and health workers often try non‑medicine methods like giving the baby a pacifier (non‑nutritive sucking), holding the baby skin‑to‑skin, or letting the baby breastfeed. Some hospitals also give a tiny amount of sweet sugar water (sucrose) because sweet taste can trigger the body’s natural pain‑relieving chemicals.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving sucrose reduces the pain that babies show during and after a heel‑lance, and whether it causes any short‑term or longer‑term problems.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies up to February 2022 that compared sucrose with other soothing methods or with no treatment in newborns. We combined the findings from those studies and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 55 studies that together included 6 273 newborn babies. Some studies looked only at full‑term babies, some at pre‑term babies, and a few included both. Most studies were carried out in hospitals in many different countries. The heel‑lance was the main procedure examined, and a few studies also looked at other small painful procedures.\n\nWhen sucrose was compared with doing nothing or with plain water, the evidence (moderate confidence) suggests that sucrose probably reduces the pain scores measured a short time after the prick (at 30 seconds and at 60 seconds). The reduction was noticeable on the PIPP scale and on the NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale) score taken immediately after the lance.\n\nWhen sucrose was compared with other soothing methods, the evidence was very uncertain. For example, adding sucrose to a pacifier (non‑nutritive sucking) might lower pain scores, but the studies were few and of low quality, so we cannot tell if the effect is real. The same uncertainty applied to comparisons with breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, or skin‑to‑skin care; the results showed little to no clear difference.\n\nComparing sucrose with glucose (another sweet solution) showed little to no difference in pain scores, but the confidence in this finding was low because the studies were small.\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported. The few minor side‑effects that did occur needed no medical treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because the studies were often small, used different methods, and sometimes the people caring for the babies knew which treatment was given. These factors make it hard to be sure about the true effects of sucrose.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
