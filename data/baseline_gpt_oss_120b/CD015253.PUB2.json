    "output": "Does self‑inflating the nose (autoinflation) help children with fluid‑filled ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n\nKey messages\n- Autoinflation may improve ear‑related quality of life and may slightly lower the chance that fluid stays in the middle ear, but the evidence is uncertain for helping hearing return to normal and for causing ear pain. No serious side‑effects were reported in the studies we found.\n- The overall confidence in these findings is low because the studies were small, not always randomly assigned, and measured outcomes in different ways.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to show clearly whether autoinflation really helps children with fluid‑filled ears and whether it causes any harm.\n\nWhat is fluid‑filled ear (otitis media with effusion) and why does it matter?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid builds up in the middle part of the ear. It is common in young children and can make hearing worse. When hearing is reduced for a long time, children may have trouble learning to speak, may behave differently, and may find school harder.\n\nWhy might blowing air into the nose help?\nAutoinflation is a technique where a child uses a small balloon or similar device to push air into the nose and back of the throat. The puff of air can open the Eustachian tube, the passage that connects the middle ear to the throat, allowing fluid to drain and the ear to “ventilate.” Some doctors suggest doing this a few times each day.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether autoinflation improves hearing, quality of life, or reduces ear pain, and whether it has any unwanted effects compared with doing nothing or with other standard treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other usual care. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included about 1,000 children aged 3 to 11 years. The studies were carried out in Europe and North America, in hospitals and community clinics. All studies compared a form of autoinflation (different devices and methods) with no treatment. Children were usually asked to do the technique two or three times a day for a few weeks, and outcomes were measured soon after the treatment period ended.\n\n- Hearing: The evidence is very uncertain about whether autoinflation helps children get back to normal hearing. We do not know if it makes a difference.\n- Quality of life: Autoinflation may improve ear‑related quality of life. The studies suggest a modest benefit, but the certainty is low.\n- Ear pain: Autoinflation may increase ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain, and overall pain was reported as uncommon.\n- Persistence of fluid: Autoinflation may slightly reduce the chance that fluid remains in the ear after three months, but the certainty of this finding is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, and many did not randomly assign children to the different groups. This means differences between groups could be due to other factors besides the treatment. In addition, the studies measured outcomes in various ways and at different times, making it hard to compare them directly.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
