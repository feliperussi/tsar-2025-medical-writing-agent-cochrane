    "output": "What are toe‑brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure tests good for in finding peripheral arterial disease?\n\nKey messages\n- The current evidence does not show a clear benefit of toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease, and no harmful effects of these tests were reported. Because the studies were small and of low quality, we cannot be sure how well the tests work.\n- Most of the research on TBI and TSBP was of very low quality, meaning the results are uncertain and may not apply to all people with or at risk of the disease.\n- More well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether TBI or TSBP can reliably detect peripheral arterial disease and to understand any possible downsides.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed by plaque. This reduces blood flow and can cause leg pain, wounds that do not heal, and in severe cases, gangrene or amputation. PAD is common worldwide and is more likely in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems.\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose PAD early?\nFinding PAD early lets doctors start treatments that lower the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and leg complications. Early diagnosis can also help people make lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or managing diabetes, to slow the disease.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure tests?\n- Toe‑brachial index (TBI) measures the pressure in a toe compared with the pressure in an arm. A low ratio may suggest reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) measures the actual pressure in a toe using a cuff, similar to the way blood pressure is measured at the arm. Low toe pressure can also indicate poor blood flow.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to see how accurately TBI and TSBP can identify PAD in people who might have the condition, and to compare the two tests against each other.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that measured TBI or TSBP and also used a reliable imaging test to confirm PAD. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that together looked at about 1,900 people for TBI and about 700 people for TSBP. The studies were carried out in various countries and used different imaging methods, such as colour duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, and conventional angiography, as the reference standard. Most studies examined only one of the two tests; a few looked at both. The research was generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting on how participants were selected and limited blinding between the heart‑blood‑flow test and the imaging reference.\n\nBecause the evidence was of very low quality, it is unclear if TBI or TSBP can accurately identify PAD. No studies reported serious side effects from using these toe‑based measurements.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, did not use random selection of participants, and often did not keep the test‑takers blind to the imaging results. These issues make it hard to know whether the test results truly reflect the presence of PAD.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
