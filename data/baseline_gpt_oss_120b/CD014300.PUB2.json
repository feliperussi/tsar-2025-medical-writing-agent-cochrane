    "output": "Is a group‑based psychosocial program better than usual care for improving mental health in people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises?\n\nKey messages  \n- Group‑based psychosocial programs may improve mental well‑being a little in adults, but we have little confidence in this finding; for children and adolescents the programs make little or no difference to mental well‑being, and may even reduce prosocial behaviour slightly, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- No harmful effects were reported in the studies we found, but the research is scarce and the results are uncertain.  \n- More high‑quality research with larger numbers of participants is needed to know whether these programmes really help people’s mental health in crisis settings.\n\nWhat is the problem?  \nPeople who have been forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, persecution or other crises often live in low‑ and middle‑income countries. The stress of displacement can hurt mental health, leading to lower well‑being, poorer daily functioning, and less hope. While many programmes try to treat mental illness, this review looked only at programmes that aim to promote positive mental health – things like feeling good, coping well, and having a good quality of life.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nThe authors wanted to know whether psychosocial programmes that are delivered in groups and run by trained lay workers (people who are not mental‑health professionals) can improve mental well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope or prosocial behaviour compared with no programme, usual care or a waiting list.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many databases for studies up to January 2023 that compared group‑based psychosocial programmes with usual care or no programme in humanitarian settings. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 13 studies that together included 7 917 people, both children and adults, from countries such as Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal and Tanzania. The programmes were all delivered in groups by paraprofessionals – people who are not mental‑health specialists but receive basic training to help. Study lengths ranged from about 10 to 32 weeks, and most funding came from academic grants or non‑governmental organisations.\n\nFor children and adolescents, the programmes did not clearly improve mental well‑being and made little or no difference to prosocial behaviour; the evidence is very uncertain. There is some indication that the programmes might improve daily functioning, but this comes from a single small study and the certainty is very low.  \n\nFor adults, the programmes may improve mental well‑being slightly, but the confidence in this finding is low and the effect may not last over time. No studies measured functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, some had methodological problems, and the results varied a lot between studies. This means we cannot be sure whether the programmes truly help or not.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
