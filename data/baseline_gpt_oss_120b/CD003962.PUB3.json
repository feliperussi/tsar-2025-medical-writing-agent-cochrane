    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs using blood‑pressure medicines (renin‑angiotensin system inhibitors) the best non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system probably lower the amount of protein in the urine and improve kidney function in people with IgA nephropathy, and they do not seem to cause more side‑effects than doing nothing or using simple symptom relief.  \n- Other non‑immune‑suppressing options such as tonsil removal, blood thinners, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese herbs, or antimalarial drugs may give small or uncertain benefits, but the studies are few, small, and often of low quality, so we cannot be sure how well they work.  \n- Because most studies were short, small, and had unclear methods, we need larger, well‑designed trials that follow people for many years to know which non‑immune‑suppressing treatments truly protect the kidneys and are safe.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney condition where a protein called immunoglobulin A builds up in the tiny filters of the kidneys. This can cause blood and protein to appear in the urine and may slowly damage the kidneys over many years. About one‑quarter to two‑fifths of people with IgAN eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Because the disease progresses slowly, doctors often try treatments that do not suppress the immune system, hoping to protect the kidneys while avoiding the side‑effects of strong immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review try to find out?  \nWe wanted to learn whether non‑immune‑suppressing treatments—such as blood‑pressure medicines, diet changes, tonsil removal, blood thinners, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines, and antimalarial drugs—help people with IgAN and whether they cause any harm.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched a large collection of medical studies up to December 2023 for trials that compared any of these non‑immune‑suppressing treatments with doing nothing, a placebo, or standard care. We combined the findings from the eligible trials and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 80 trials that together included almost 5,000 people with biopsy‑confirmed IgAN. Most of the studies were short‑term and involved relatively few participants. The trials were carried out in many countries, but the majority of the research on tonsil removal came from Japan. The most frequently studied treatments were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (often called ACE inhibitors or ARBs).  \n\n**Blood‑pressure medicines (renin‑angiotensin system inhibitors)** – The evidence, which we feel moderately confident about, suggests these medicines probably reduce the amount of protein that leaks into the urine and improve measures of kidney function such as serum creatinine and creatinine clearance. The same evidence indicates they probably do not change the risk of progressing to kidney failure, and they do not appear to cause more side‑effects than placebo or simple symptom relief.  \n\n**Tonsil removal (tonsillectomy)** – In a small number of studies done in Japanese people, the evidence (low confidence) hints that adding tonsil removal to standard care may increase the chance that people’s protein in the urine goes into remission and may also improve microscopic blood in the urine. However, we are not sure whether these results apply to people in other countries.  \n\n**Blood thinners, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines, and antimalarial drugs** – The trials showed small possible benefits for kidney function when these were compared with placebo, but when they were compared with standard care the benefits disappeared. The confidence in these findings is low, meaning we cannot be sure the benefits are real.  \n\nOverall, the studies did not report deaths, major kidney failure events, or serious worsening of kidney function for most of the treatments, so we cannot say whether any hidden harms exist.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the overall evidence because many of the studies did not randomly assign people to the different treatment groups, the studies were often very small, and important details about how the trials were run were missing. These problems make it hard to know whether the observed effects are truly due to the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2023."
