    "output": "Does placing an abdominal drain (a tube that removes fluid) after surgery for complicated appendicitis prevent infections inside the belly?\n\n- Using a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis does not clearly lower the chance of an infection inside the belly (intraperitoneal abscess) or wound infection, and the evidence is very uncertain. The drain may increase the chance of death and may lead to a longer hospital stay, but the certainty of these findings is also low.\n- No studies compared different types of drains or looked at the best time to remove a drain, so we do not know if one kind of drain works better than another or if early removal is safer.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether drains truly help or harm people after this surgery, especially regarding survival and how long people stay in hospital.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why might a drain be used?  \nAppendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix that often needs to be removed by surgery. When the appendix has burst or the tissue is dead (gangrenous), the condition is called complicated appendicitis. People with this form are more likely to develop problems after surgery, such as infections inside the belly. Some surgeons place a drain—a thin tube that can collect fluid—to try to prevent these problems, but it is not clear whether this helps.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis reduces the risk of an infection inside the belly, wound infection, other complications, death, or the length of hospital stay. We also looked for evidence about different drain types and the best time to remove a drain.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases and trial registers for studies that compared a drain with no drain, or compared different drains, in people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight studies that together included 739 people of all ages. The studies were carried out in North America, Asia, and Africa between 1973 and 2023. Most participants had a burst appendix with infection spreading in the belly. All participants received antibiotics after surgery. The studies were judged to have a high risk of bias, meaning the way they were done could affect the reliability of the results.\n\nThe evidence does not show that a drain prevents an infection inside the belly or a wound infection. It is unclear if a drain changes the overall chance of other complications. The evidence suggests that using a drain may increase the risk of death and may lead to a longer stay in hospital, but we are very uncertain about these findings because the studies were small, not well balanced, and gave different results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, the studies were very small, and the results varied between studies. These issues make it hard to know whether any observed differences are real.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023."
