    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 immunotherapy helpful for adults with glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Anti‑PD‑1 medicines such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab probably do not improve overall survival or slow disease progression in most adults with glioblastoma, and in some treatment combinations they probably increase serious side‑effects; many studies did not report any new safety problems.  \n- One very small study suggested that giving pembrolizumab before and after surgery might improve survival, but the evidence is very uncertain and needs confirmation.  \n- Because the existing studies are few, often small, and at risk of bias, we need more well‑designed research to know whether any of these medicines can truly help people with glioblastoma.\n\nWhat is glioblastoma?  \nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult brain tumor. It usually shortens life to about a year and a half after diagnosis. The tumor creates an environment that blocks the body’s immune system, making it hard for treatments that rely on immune activation to work.\n\nWhy might anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 medicines be used?  \nAnti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 medicines (sometimes called immune checkpoint inhibitors) are drugs that help the immune system recognise and attack cancer cells. They have helped people with some other cancers, so researchers have tested them in glioblastoma.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to see whether these immune medicines, given alone or together with other treatments, change how long people live, how long the tumor stays under control, and whether they cause serious or less‑serious side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched major medical databases for studies that compared anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 medicines with placebo or other therapies in adults with glioblastoma. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how confident we felt in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified seven randomized studies that together involved about 2,000 adults with grade 4 glioma. Some participants had newly diagnosed disease, others had recurrent disease after earlier treatment. The studies were carried out in several countries and many received funding from the drug manufacturers that make the medicines.\n\nMain results  \n\n- In people whose glioblastoma had come back, nivolumab alone probably does not increase overall survival or the time the tumor stays under control, and it probably does not improve the chance that the tumor shrinks.  \n- Adding bevacizumab (a drug that blocks blood‑vessel growth) to nivolumab or pembrolizumab probably does not improve survival, disease control, or tumor response, and the evidence about side‑effects is very uncertain.  \n- Giving pembrolizumab both before surgery (neoadjuvant) and after surgery (adjuvant) may improve overall survival and disease control, but the evidence is very uncertain because it comes from a single small study.  \n- In newly diagnosed glioblastoma, combining nivolumab with radiotherapy, with or without the chemotherapy temozolomide, probably does not increase survival or disease control. In the group of patients whose tumors had a specific genetic marker (methylated), adding nivolumab to the standard three‑drug regimen probably increases serious side‑effects.  \n- In older adults receiving standard chemotherapy, adding nivolumab probably does not improve survival or disease control, and the evidence about side‑effects is very uncertain.\n\nOverall, most comparisons showed little or no benefit from anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 medicines, and in some settings they may raise the risk of serious side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small, some did not hide which treatment people received, and the results varied a lot between studies. These issues make it hard to be sure about the true effects of the medicines.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
