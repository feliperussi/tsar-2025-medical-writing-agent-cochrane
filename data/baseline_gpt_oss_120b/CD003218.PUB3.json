    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDo psychostimulant medicines (drugs that increase alertness) help people with myotonic dystrophy feel less sleepy during the day?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Psychostimulants may make people with myotonic dystrophy report feeling less sleepy, but we are not sure if they improve objective sleep‑wake tests or overall quality of life, and they might increase the chance of side‑effects.  \n- All of the studies looked at only a short period of a few weeks, so we do not know whether any benefits or harms continue over longer times.  \n- More well‑designed, longer studies are needed to find out how well these medicines work and how safe they are for people with myotonic dystrophy.  \n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why does daytime sleepiness matter?  \nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness and can affect many parts of the body. A common problem for people with this condition is excessive daytime sleepiness – they feel very tired and have trouble staying awake during the day. This can make it hard to work, study, drive, or enjoy daily activities.  \n\nWhat treatments are usually tried for this sleepiness?  \nDoctors sometimes give medicines called psychostimulants, such as modafinil, that are meant to increase alertness. These drugs are used for other sleep‑related problems, but it is not clear how well they work for people with myotonic dystrophy.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to learn whether psychostimulant medicines help reduce daytime sleepiness and improve quality of life for people with myotonic dystrophy, and whether these medicines are safe.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared a psychostimulant with a placebo or no treatment in people with myotonic dystrophy. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified several studies that together included a few hundred adult participants. All participants were out‑patients, ranging from young adults to older adults, and each study followed them for only a short period of a few weeks. Most of the studies used a design where each person tried both the medicine and a placebo at different times. The studies were carried out in various countries and were mostly funded by academic or public sources.  \n\nThe main findings were:  \n\n- For a test that measures how long a person can stay awake (the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test), we do not know if psychostimulants make any difference.  \n- For a questionnaire where people rate their own sleepiness (the Epworth Sleepiness Scale), psychostimulants may reduce the feeling of sleepiness.  \n- For another test that measures how quickly a person falls asleep (the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), we do not know if psychostimulants have any effect.  \n- For overall quality of life, we do not know if psychostimulants bring any benefit.  \n- People taking psychostimulants may experience more side‑effects than those not taking them, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, some participants may have known whether they were taking the medicine or a placebo, and the studies used different methods and groups of people. These factors make it hard to be sure about the results.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
