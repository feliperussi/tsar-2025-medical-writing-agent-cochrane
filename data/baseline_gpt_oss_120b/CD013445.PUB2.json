    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nKey Messages  \n- PCNL may increase the chance of being stone‑free and may greatly reduce the need for another procedure, while probably not changing the risk of serious complications, but it may lead to a slightly longer hospital stay. No information was found about unexpected doctor visits or quality‑of‑life effects.  \n- The evidence comes from many small studies, many of which were only reported as brief abstracts, so we have little confidence in most of the results.  \n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed studies that also look at quality of life and any unexpected medical visits after treatment.\n\nWhat is the problem that kidney stones cause?  \nKidney stones (also called renal stones) are hard pieces that can form inside the kidney. They often cause sudden pain, block the flow of urine, and can lead to infections. Depending on the size and location of the stone, doctors may watch the stone, break it with shock waves, or use one of two main surgical approaches: a tube placed through the skin into the kidney (percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or PCNL) or a thin scope passed up through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery, or RIRS).\n\nWhy compare PCNL and RIRS?  \nBoth PCNL and RIRS aim to remove or break kidney stones, but they work in different ways. PCNL involves a small incision in the back to reach the stone directly, while RIRS uses a flexible tube that goes up through the urethra and bladder. Understanding which method works better, causes fewer problems, and leads to a quicker recovery helps doctors and patients choose the right treatment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to learn whether PCNL or RIRS is more effective at making people stone‑free, whether one causes more serious complications, whether either reduces the need for additional procedures, and how each affects hospital stay, unexpected medical visits, ureter injuries, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that directly compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. We combined the findings from those studies and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found dozens of studies that together involved several thousand adults with kidney stones ranging from small to fairly large. Most studies were carried out in hospitals around the world, but many did not say who funded the research. The size of the PCNL tube varied, with most using smaller‑diameter tubes.  \n\nMain results  \n\n- Stone‑free rate: PCNL may increase stone‑free rates slightly.  \n- Need for secondary procedures: PCNL may cause a large reduction in the need for additional procedures.  \n- Major complications: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to serious complications.  \n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may increase the length of hospital stay slightly.  \n- Ureteral strictures or injuries: PCNL may make little or no difference to ureteral strictures.  \n- Unplanned medical visits: No studies reported any unexpected doctor or emergency visits after treatment.  \n- Quality of life: No studies reported how the treatments affected people’s overall well‑being.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small, some were only brief abstracts, and the way the procedures were performed varied between studies. These issues make it hard to be sure about the true effects of the two treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
