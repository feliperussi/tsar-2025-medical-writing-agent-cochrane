    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDoes bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment improve lung health in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Using antibiotics chosen from bronchoscopy samples (a tube that collects fluid from deep in the lungs) probably makes little or no difference to lung function, chest‑scan scores, nutrition, or quality of life, and may lead to more hospital stays; mild cough after the procedure is common, and serious breathing problems are rare.  \n- The evidence comes from only two small studies that looked at children with CF; no studies included adults.  \n- More and larger studies are needed, especially in older children and adults, to know whether bronchoscopy‑guided treatment is worth the extra effort and risk.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why do lung infections matter?  \nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes thick mucus build up in the lungs, leading to frequent infections. These infections damage the lungs over time, so early and accurate treatment is very important.  \n\nHow are infections usually diagnosed?  \nDoctors often use sputum (spit) or throat swabs to grow bacteria in the lab. When a person cannot produce sputum, they may rely only on throat swabs, but this method can miss bacteria that live deeper in the lungs.  \n\nWhat is bronchoscopy‑guided treatment?  \nBronchoscopy is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube is passed through the mouth into the lungs to wash out fluid (bronchoalveolar lavage, or BAL). The fluid is then cultured to see which bacteria are present, and antibiotics are chosen based on those results.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether choosing antibiotics based on BAL samples leads to better health outcomes than choosing antibiotics based on sputum, throat, or cough swabs and clinical signs.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that compared bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics with other ways of choosing antibiotics. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found two studies that together included about 200 children with CF. One study followed infants from birth until they were five years old; the other followed children aged five to 18 years for a shorter period. Both studies compared a group that received antibiotics based on BAL results with a group that received standard care based on clinical signs and throat‑swab cultures. The studies were carried out in hospitals in high‑income countries and were funded by a mix of public and charitable sources.\n\nMain results  \n- Using bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics may make little or no difference to lung function measured by standard breathing tests. (low‑certainty evidence)  \n- Using bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics probably makes little or no difference to chest‑scan scores that show lung damage. (moderate‑certainty evidence)  \n- Using bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics may make little or no difference to nutrition, quality of life, and the number of bacteria found in the lungs. (low‑certainty evidence)  \n- Using bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics may lead to more hospital stays each year. (low‑certainty evidence)  \n- The cost of care was probably similar between the two approaches. (moderate‑certainty evidence)  \n- Mild side effects, such as a temporary worsening of cough after the bronchoscopy, were common. Serious breathing problems occurred in a small number of procedures.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023."
