    "output": "Is removing the urinary catheter early (before 5 days) after a kidney transplant better than removing it later?\n\nKey messages  \n- We are not confident that taking the catheter out early changes the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms; the studies did not show a clear difference and did not report any extra harms.  \n- No reliable information was found about whether early removal reduces painful urinary‑tract infections or serious kidney‑related problems that need treatment.  \n- Better, larger studies are needed to find out if the timing of catheter removal matters for people after a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat is a kidney transplant and why is a urinary catheter used?  \nKidney transplantation is the best way to treat people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed in the bladder so urine can drain while the new kidney heals. The tube helps protect the connection between the new kidney and the bladder, but it also lets germs enter the bladder and cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI). The longer the tube stays in, the higher the risk of infection.\n\nWhat did the review want to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare two groups of transplant recipients: those who had the catheter removed in less than 5 days after surgery and those who kept it in for 5 days or more. The main questions were whether early removal lowered the number of people with bacteria in the urine (even if they felt fine), reduced real UTIs, or prevented serious kidney‑related problems that need extra treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe looked for studies that compared early and late catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined the results they reported, and judged how much confidence we could have in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two studies that together included about 200 people who had received a kidney transplant. Both studies compared removal before 5 days with removal after 5 days. The research was done in hospitals that treat transplant patients, but the studies were small and one of them was only a conference abstract with very limited details. The people in the studies were of different ages and both men and women were included. The studies did not receive clear funding from industry or other sources, and the follow‑up time was short—no one was followed for more than one month after the transplant.\n\nBecause the evidence was very uncertain, we cannot say whether early removal makes a difference to the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms. In other words, we do not know if taking the catheter out early helps or harms people in this respect. The studies also did not provide any data on whether early removal changes the number of painful UTIs or serious kidney‑related complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies knew which timing they were getting, and because the studies were very small. These issues make it hard to tell whether any observed differences are real.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
