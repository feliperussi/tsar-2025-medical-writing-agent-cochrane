    "output": "Does using a video laryngoscope improve breathing‑tube placement in newborn babies compared with a standard laryngoscope?\n\nKey messages\n- Using a video laryngoscope (a device that shows a live video of the airway) may increase the chance that the breathing tube is placed correctly on the first try and may need fewer tries overall, but it probably does not make the procedure faster.  \n- The evidence that the video tool reduces injury to the airway is more reliable, while we do not know whether it changes the baby’s oxygen levels or heart‑rate problems during the procedure.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm how much the video laryngoscope helps and whether it is safe for all newborns.\n\nWhy is securing the airway important for newborn babies?\nWhen a newborn cannot breathe well on its own, doctors must quickly place a breathing tube (endotracheal intubation) to keep the airway open. Delays or repeated attempts can cause low oxygen levels, slow heart rate, or injury to the throat. Finding a method that makes the tube placement easier and safer is therefore a high priority in delivery rooms and neonatal intensive‑care units.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to compare video laryngoscopy with the traditional direct laryngoscopy (a handheld tool that lets the doctor look straight at the throat) to see whether the video method shortens the time needed, reduces the number of attempts, improves first‑attempt success, and lowers the risk of breathing‑tube‑related harms in babies up to 28 days old.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared video laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in newborns. We combined the results of the eligible studies and judged how confident we could be in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight studies that together reported 759 attempts to place a breathing tube in newborns from hospitals around the world. The studies used different video devices such as C‑MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope. Most of the studies were small and had some problems with how they were carried out.\n\n- The video method probably does not make the procedure faster. (low confidence)  \n- The video method may reduce the number of attempts needed, but the effect is small. (low confidence)  \n- The video method may increase the chance of getting the tube right on the first try. (low confidence)  \n- The video method may make little or no difference to the lowest oxygen level the baby reaches during the procedure. (low confidence)  \n- We do not know if the video method changes the risk of the baby’s heart rate dropping or of oxygen desaturation during the attempt. (very low confidence)  \n- The video method probably lowers the risk of injury to the airway (such as bruising or tears). (moderate confidence)\n\nHow confident are we in these findings?\nWe have little confidence in most of the results because the studies were small and because some did not hide which method the doctors were using, which could affect how they performed. For the finding about reduced airway injury, we are moderately confident because the result was seen in several studies, although the overall evidence still has some limitations.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022."
