    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs feeding through a tube (jejunostomy) better than IV nutrition after a Whipple operation for adults?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Feeding through a tube placed in the small intestine (jejunostomy) probably shortens the time people stay in hospital compared with nutrition given through an IV line, and it does not clearly increase or decrease serious complications after surgery.  \n- Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose (naso‑jejunal tube) or feeding through a tube in the intestine shows little or no difference in hospital stay or complications when compared with IV nutrition, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n- Because the studies were small, varied a lot, and sometimes had design problems, we have little confidence in these findings; more high‑quality research is needed.\n\nWhat is the problem that people face after a Whipple operation?  \nA Whipple operation removes the head of the pancreas and changes how food moves through the gut. After this major surgery many people lose weight and become malnourished, which can slow recovery and increase the risk of complications. Doctors try to keep nutrition good by giving food by mouth, by a tube that goes into the intestine, or by an IV line that provides nutrients directly into the blood.\n\nWhy did the review authors look at different ways of giving nutrition?  \nThe review team wanted to find out whether the way nutrition is given after surgery (by tube, by IV line, or by normal eating) changes how quickly people recover, how many complications they have, and whether it affects how long they stay in the hospital.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared different ways of giving nutrition after a Whipple operation. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 17 studies that together included 1,897 adults who had a Whipple operation. The studies were carried out in many countries and used a variety of feeding methods: at least 13 studies used tube feeding into the intestine, 10 used IV nutrition, and 7 used normal oral eating. The length of follow‑up in the studies ranged from a few days to several weeks after surgery. Some studies were funded by hospitals or research charities, while others did not report funding sources.\n\nWhen tube feeding through a jejunostomy was compared with IV nutrition, the evidence that we are moderately confident in suggests that jejunostomy feeding probably shortens the hospital stay. For serious complications such as leaks from the pancreas, delayed stomach emptying, or bleeding after surgery, the evidence is uncertain and shows little or no clear difference between the two methods.\n\nWhen a naso‑jejunal tube was compared with IV nutrition, the evidence (which we have little confidence in) shows little or no difference in how long people stay in the hospital or in the rates of complications. There is some indication that IV nutrition might slightly increase the chance of a pancreatic leak, but this finding is also uncertain.\n\nWhen jejunostomy feeding was compared with normal oral eating, the evidence (very uncertain) shows little or no difference in hospital stay, leaks, delayed stomach emptying, bleeding, or overall complication rates.\n\nNo clear difference in death rates after surgery was seen in any of the comparisons, but the evidence for this outcome is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the overall findings because many of the studies were small, used different feeding methods and timing, and some may have had design problems that could affect the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
