    "output": "Is a birth‑control pill that contains drospirenone (a type of hormone) helpful for women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)?\n\nKey messages  \n- Drospirenone‑containing birth‑control pills may lessen overall premenstrual symptoms and may help with daily activities, work, social life and relationships, but the benefit is small and the evidence is not strong; the pills also cause more side‑effects such as breast tenderness, nausea, spotting between periods and irregular periods, and more women stop taking them because of these side‑effects.  \n- No studies compared drospirenone pills with other types of combined birth‑control pills, so we do not know if they are better or worse than alternatives.  \n- Because the studies were small, not well reported and gave inconsistent results, we have little confidence in these findings and more high‑quality research is needed.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?  \nPMS is a common problem that causes physical and emotional symptoms in the days before a period. When the symptoms are very severe, it is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both conditions can interfere with work, school, friendships and family life. Many women use combined oral contraceptives (birth‑control pills that contain both estrogen and a progestin hormone) to prevent pregnancy, and some of these pills have been studied to see if they also relieve premenstrual symptoms.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to know whether combined birth‑control pills that contain the hormone drospirenone improve premenstrual symptoms and whether they cause any harmful side‑effects compared with a placebo pill or with no pill.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared drospirenone‑containing birth‑control pills with placebo or no pill. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified five studies that together included 858 women, most of whom had PMDD. The studies were carried out in different countries and lasted for a few menstrual cycles. The pills were compared only with placebo; no study compared them with other types of combined birth‑control pills.\n\nThe evidence suggests that drospirenone‑containing pills may reduce overall premenstrual symptoms slightly. They may also make a small improvement in how the symptoms affect daily life, work productivity, social activities and relationships, but the benefit is modest. The pills may increase the chance that women stop taking the medication because of side‑effects. They also may increase the overall number of side‑effects, especially breast tenderness, nausea, spotting between periods and irregular periods. There is some indication that more women may notice an improvement in their symptoms (a slightly higher response rate) when taking the drospirenone pill compared with placebo. No serious rare side‑effects such as blood clots were reported in the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, some details about how they were done were not clearly reported, and the results varied between studies. This means we cannot be sure how well the pills work or how often side‑effects occur.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
