    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs using digital tools together with usual care better than usual care alone for helping children and teens lose body fat?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Adding digital tools (such as apps, text messages, or active video games) to the regular care that children and teens with obesity receive probably reduces body fat a little, and no harmful side‑effects were reported.  \n- Using digital tools by themselves, without the regular care, did not show a clear benefit or harm for any of the outcomes we looked at.  \n- Because the studies were few, involved small numbers of participants, and lasted only a short time, we cannot be sure how well these digital approaches work in the long run; more research is needed.\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?  \nChildhood obesity is a global health issue that raises the risk of many long‑term diseases. More than 340 million kids and teens aged 5‑19 were living with excess weight in 2016. Traditional programs often combine diet advice and physical‑activity plans, but many families find it hard to stick with them.\n\nWhy might digital tools help?  \nDigital health tools—like wearable devices, smartphone apps, text‑message reminders, web programmes, active video games, and video‑call visits—can reach children and families at home, give instant feedback, and make healthy habits more engaging. The review wanted to find out whether these tools improve weight‑related outcomes when they are added to usual care, or when they are used alone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe aimed to see whether digital health interventions, either together with or instead of standard obesity care, change body‑mass measures, body‑fat levels, physical activity, well‑being, or any safety problems in children and adolescents.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases and trial registers for studies that compared digital tools plus usual care with usual care alone, and for studies that compared digital tools alone with usual care alone. We combined the results of the eligible studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 15 studies that together included 911 children and teenagers aged 10‑19 years (some also included younger children). The studies were carried out in the United States, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland and Thailand. Most studies lasted less than six months, and a few lasted six months or longer. The digital interventions varied: some used apps or text messages, others used active video games or wearable devices, and they were usually combined with diet advice, exercise plans, or both. The comparison groups received the same diet or exercise advice but without any digital component.\n\nWhen digital tools were added to the regular care, the evidence (moderate confidence) suggests that they probably reduce body‑fat levels slightly. No study reported any adverse events, so we have no evidence of harm. For all other outcomes—such as overall weight, physical activity, mental well‑being, blood pressure, or quality of life—the results were unclear. When digital tools were used alone, the evidence did not show a clear benefit or harm for any outcome, and we cannot tell whether they make a difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the finding about a small reduction in body fat because the studies were few and involved only a small number of participants, and many important outcomes were not measured or reported. This makes it hard to know whether the benefit would last over a longer period or apply to all children and teens.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025."
