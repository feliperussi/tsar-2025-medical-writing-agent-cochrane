    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs giving zinc supplements helpful for preventing death, illness, and growth problems in children?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Giving zinc (a mineral that helps the body work properly) to children does not change the chance of dying from any cause, but it probably lowers the chance of dying from pneumonia‑type lung infections and from malaria, and it probably reduces how often children get diarrhea. Zinc also probably helps children grow a little taller, but it increases the chance that a child will have at least one episode of vomiting.  \n- The benefit of zinc on growth and on preventing diarrhea was seen mainly when zinc was given alone; when zinc was taken together with iron, the good effects were smaller.  \n- Because many of the studies were small and the results were sometimes uncertain, we are only moderately confident about the benefits for specific illnesses and growth. More large, well‑designed studies are needed, especially in areas where zinc deficiency is common.\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?  \nWhy is zinc important for children?  \nMany children in low‑ and middle‑income countries do not get enough zinc from their food. Not having enough zinc can make children more likely to get sick, to die, and to grow poorly. Health workers sometimes give zinc tablets or syrup to children to try to prevent these problems, but we need to know whether this works.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to know whether giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years reduces death from any cause, reduces death from specific illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia‑type lung infections, and malaria, lowers how often children get sick with these illnesses, helps children grow taller, and whether zinc causes any unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared giving zinc supplements with giving no supplement or a placebo. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 96 studies that together included about 220 000 children from 34 countries, most of them low‑ or middle‑income. Most of the children were under five years old. The zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate, at a dose of about 10 mg to 15 mg each day, and the children were followed for about six months.\n\nThe evidence shows that zinc supplementation makes little to no difference to overall death rates in children. It probably reduces deaths caused by pneumonia‑type lung infections and by malaria, and probably makes little to no difference to deaths caused by diarrhea. Zinc probably reduces how often children get diarrhea, but it makes little to no difference to how often they get pneumonia‑type lung infections. Zinc probably helps children grow a little taller. However, zinc clearly increases the chance that a child will experience at least one episode of vomiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are confident that zinc makes little to no difference to overall death and that it increases vomiting. We are moderately confident about the other findings because many of the studies were small and the results were sometimes uncertain, which means we cannot be sure how large the true effects are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
