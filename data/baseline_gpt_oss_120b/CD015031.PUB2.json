    "output": "Is the inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique better than standard ILM peeling for closing large macular holes?\n\nKey messages  \n- The flap technique probably helps the hole close more often and may give a small improvement in vision after three months or more; serious eye complications were not reported in the studies we found.  \n- The evidence comes from a few small studies, so we have only limited confidence in the vision benefit and moderate confidence that the flap improves hole closure.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm these findings and to see whether any hidden risks exist.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?  \nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina, the part of the eye that lets you see details straight ahead. When the hole is large (wider than about 400 µm) it can cause a noticeable loss of central vision, making reading, driving and recognizing faces difficult.  \n\nWhy compare two ways of doing eye surgery for large macular holes?  \nThe usual surgery, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with ILM peeling, removes a thin layer of tissue (the internal limiting membrane) to help the hole close. This works well for small holes but often fails for larger ones. A newer method flips a piece of that membrane back onto the hole (the inverted ILM flap) and might give the tissue a better chance to seal the defect.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to see whether the inverted‑flap method gives better vision and higher hole‑closure rates than the standard peeling method, and whether it causes any extra harms.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that directly compared the two surgical approaches for large macular holes. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how much confidence we could place in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nThe studies we identified involved a few hundred eyes from older adults, most of whom were women. All the eyes had large idiopathic macular holes. The surgeries were performed in hospitals in India, Poland and Mexico, and follow‑up lasted from three months up to one year. No study reported financial conflicts of interest.  \n\nVision after surgery  \nThe flap technique may improve visual acuity slightly after three months or more compared with standard peeling. The improvement is modest, and because the studies were small, we have little confidence that this benefit will be seen in all patients.  \n\nHole closure  \nThe flap technique probably increases the chance that the macular hole closes completely, and it also probably raises the chance of achieving a “type 1” closure, which is the most complete form of healing. Our confidence in this finding is moderate because the studies were fairly consistent and the effect was clear.  \n\nHarms  \nSerious complications such as retinal detachment were not reported in the studies, and no other major harms were noted.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the vision‑improvement result because the studies were small and some did not hide which surgery the surgeon performed, which could affect how outcomes were measured. We are moderately confident that the flap improves hole closure because the studies gave similar results and were generally well conducted, but the overall number of participants was still limited.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
