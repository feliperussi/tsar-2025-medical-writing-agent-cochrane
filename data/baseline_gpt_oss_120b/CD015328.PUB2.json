    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs it better to use school‑based activity programmes, diet advice, or a mix of both to keep children aged 5‑11 from becoming overweight?\n\nKey Messages  \n- School‑based activity programmes, either alone or together with diet advice, may lead to a small drop in body‑mass index (a measure of weight) over the short‑ and medium‑term, but they do not seem to keep the benefit after a year or more.  \n- Diet‑only programmes probably make little or no difference to children’s weight at any time point.  \n- Serious side‑effects were rarely reported, and the evidence is limited because many studies were small, varied a lot in how they were run, and often did not include children with disabilities or from low‑income backgrounds.\n\nWhat is the problem and why does it matter?  \nWhat is childhood obesity and why do we want to prevent it?  \nObesity means a child has excess body fat that can harm health, growth and confidence. Around the world many children become overweight, and this raises the risk of diabetes, heart problems and other illnesses later in life.  \n\nWhat are the usual ways to try to stop obesity from starting?  \nCommon approaches try to change what children eat, how much they move, how much they sit, or how well they sleep. Schools often deliver these programmes, but community groups, homes and clinics can also be used.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether programmes that focus on diet, on activity, or on both together can lower children’s body‑mass index (BMI) and whether they cause any serious harms.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe looked for studies that compared diet or activity programmes (or a mix of both) with doing nothing special or with usual care. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 172 studies that together included about 190,000 children aged 5‑11 years. Most studies were carried out in schools in high‑income countries; a few took place in community settings, homes or clinics. About three‑quarters of the studies were funded by non‑industry sources. The programmes lasted from a single visit up to four years, but most were shorter than nine months.\n\n**Diet‑only programmes**  \nThese programmes probably make little or no difference to children’s BMI at any time point.  \n\n**Activity‑only programmes**  \nThese programmes may make little or no difference to BMI in the short term, but they likely cause a small reduction in BMI after about six to twelve months. The benefit does not appear to last beyond a year.  \n\n**Combined diet + activity programmes**  \nThese programmes may lead to a slight drop in BMI in the short term and probably cause a modest reduction in BMI after six to twelve months. By the long term they seem to make little or no difference.  \n\nSerious adverse events (such as severe injuries or major health problems) were reported in only a few studies, and most studies found no increase in such events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small, used different methods, and involved different groups of children. This makes it hard to be sure about the true size of any benefit or harm. In addition, few studies looked at children with disabilities or at families from lower‑income backgrounds, so we do not know how well the programmes work for those groups.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023."
