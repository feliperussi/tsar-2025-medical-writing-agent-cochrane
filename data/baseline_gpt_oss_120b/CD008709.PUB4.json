    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nAre single‑incision sling operations (a short synthetic mesh placed through the vaginal wall) as effective and safe as other sling surgeries for stress urinary incontinence in women?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Single‑incision slings work about the same as other sling types (retropubic and transobturator) for improving leakage at one year, and they probably cause a large reduction in post‑surgery pain compared with transobturator slings; however, we do not have enough good evidence to know if they change the chance of painful sex, mesh problems, or the need for another surgery.  \n- The few studies that compared single‑incision slings (about 70 women) with a sling made from the woman’s own tissue did not provide clear information on cure rates, pain, or other harms, so the effect of single‑incision slings versus that option remains uncertain.  \n- More long‑term research is needed, especially studies that look at safety issues such as mesh exposure, urinary retention, and repeat surgeries, because current evidence is limited and often uncertain.  \n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why does it matter?  \nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where the bladder leaks when a woman coughs, sneezes, or lifts something heavy. It can affect daily life, cause embarrassment, and lead to extra health‑care costs. Many women try non‑surgical options first, but when those do not work, a sling surgery is often offered to support the urethra and stop the leaks.  \n\nWhat are single‑incision slings and how do they differ from other sling surgeries?  \nA single‑incision sling is a thin piece of synthetic mesh that is inserted through a small cut in the front wall of the vagina to hold the middle part of the urethra. Other common sling methods use a longer mesh that is placed through the abdomen (retropubic sling) or through a side pathway (transobturator sling). The single‑incision approach is meant to be less invasive and may cause less pain after the operation.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether single‑incision slings improve leakage as well as other sling types, and whether they cause more or fewer side‑effects such as pain, mesh exposure, urinary retention, or the need for another surgery. We also looked for any information on cost‑effectiveness.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that compared single‑incision slings with other sling surgeries or with a sling made from a woman’s own tissue. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 62 studies that together included about 8,000 women with stress urinary incontinence. Most studies were done in hospitals in many countries and followed women for at least one year after surgery. A small number of studies used a sling called TVT‑Secur, which is no longer sold; those results were examined separately. Two economic evaluations and one cost‑minimisation analysis were identified, but they did not give clear answers about value for money.  \n\nMain results:  \n- Compared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings probably make little to no difference in how many women feel cured or improved after 12 months.  \n- Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings make little to no difference in cure rates, but they probably cause a large reduction in pain reported after 24 months.  \n- Single‑incision slings probably reduce the chance of mesh exposure or erosion compared with transobturator slings, and they probably reduce urinary retention after surgery.  \n- Evidence about whether single‑incision slings affect painful sex, quality of life, or the need for repeat surgery is uncertain or suggests only a small possible change.  \n- When single‑incision slings were compared with a sling made from a woman’s own tissue, the studies did not provide enough information to tell if they are better or worse for any outcome.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because the studies were often small, some did not hide which treatment each woman received, and the results varied between studies. This makes it hard to be sure about the true benefits and harms.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.  "
