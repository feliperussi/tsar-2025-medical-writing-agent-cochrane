    "output": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (MST) better than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages\n- The only study we found showed that MST may work about the same as ECT for overall schizophrenia symptoms, and it may cause fewer memory problems, but the evidence is very uncertain and the study had many problems. No clear difference in side‑effects was reported.\n- Because the review is based on a single, small study with serious limitations, we cannot be sure whether MST truly offers any benefit or harm compared with ECT.\n- More well‑designed research with larger numbers of people is needed before we can know if MST is a useful option for schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why do we need other treatments?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental health condition that can cause hallucinations, delusions, and difficulties thinking or feeling motivated. Medicines called antipsychotics are the main treatment, but about one‑in‑five people do not get enough relief from these drugs. When medicines do not help, doctors look for other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy (MST) and how does it differ from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?\nMST is a newer, non‑invasive brain‑stimulation method that uses magnetic fields to create a brief seizure in the brain, similar to the seizure caused by ECT. ECT uses an electric current to do the same. Both are used when medicines are not enough, but MST is thought to cause fewer memory problems because the magnetic field can be more focused.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to see whether MST, added to usual care, works better than ECT (also added to usual care) for improving schizophrenia symptoms and whether it is safer or causes fewer side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared MST with ECT or other treatments for schizophrenia. We combined the results of any eligible studies and judged how much confidence we could have in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one short‑term study that enrolled adults with acute schizophrenia. The study compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The researchers reported that the two treatments gave similar results for overall mental state, positive symptoms (like hallucinations) and negative symptoms (like lack of motivation). They also noted that people receiving MST seemed to have fewer problems with delayed memory and showed some improvement in overall thinking abilities. However, the study had many issues: it stopped early, the groups were not well balanced at the start, and it was unclear whether participants and staff knew which treatment was given. Because of these problems, we are very uncertain about all the findings.\n\n- It is unclear if MST changes overall schizophrenia symptoms compared with ECT.  \n- It is unclear if MST reduces memory problems compared with ECT.  \n- It is unclear if MST improves overall thinking abilities compared with ECT.  \n- It is unclear if MST changes the chance of stopping treatment because of side‑effects or lack of benefit.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was small, people in the study may have known which treatment they received, and the study stopped early and had imbalances between groups. These issues make it hard to tell whether any observed differences are real.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
