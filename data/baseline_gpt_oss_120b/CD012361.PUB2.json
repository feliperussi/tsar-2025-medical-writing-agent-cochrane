    "output": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for calming and pain relief in newborns on breathing machines?\n\nKey Messages  \n- No studies that met our criteria were found, so we cannot say whether dexmedetomidine helps or harms newborns who need a breathing machine.  \n- Some research is still being done, but the results are not yet available, so we do not have information about safety or long‑term effects.  \n- More high‑quality studies are needed to find out if dexmedetomidine works well and is safe for these tiny patients.\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?  \nNewborn babies (under four weeks old) sometimes need a breathing machine called mechanical ventilation. While they are on the machine they often need medicines to keep them calm and free from pain. Currently doctors often use morphine or other strong pain medicines, but these can affect blood pressure and heart rate. Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that works on a part of the nervous system called the alpha‑2 receptor. It is thought to calm babies without changing their heart or blood pressure much. Although it is being used more often, it is not officially approved for pain relief in newborns.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to know whether dexmedetomidine works better or safer than other non‑opioid medicines, opioid medicines, or no medicine at all for calming and relieving pain in newborns who are on a breathing machine. They also wanted to learn about any side effects, how long the babies stayed on the machine, and whether the medicine affected survival or later brain development.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several large medical databases and two trial registries for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines or placebo in newborns on a breathing machine. We combined the findings from any eligible studies and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found **no completed studies** that met our inclusion rules. The search identified four studies that are still in progress. Two of those will compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborns who need surgery. The other two are waiting for full reports: one will compare dexmedetomidine with morphine in newborns who have had a lack of oxygen and are being cooled, and the other will look at dexmedetomidine versus a mix of ketamine and dexmedetomidine for heart‑ultrasound exams in children up to three years old. The planned size of these studies ranges from about 40 to 200 newborns. Because no finished studies were available, we have no evidence about how well dexmedetomidine works, whether it reduces the need for other medicines, or whether it causes side effects such as low blood pressure. We also have no information about its impact on survival or long‑term brain development.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in any conclusions because there are **no completed studies** to look at. Without data, we cannot tell whether any differences between dexmedetomidine and other medicines are real or due to chance. The lack of research means we do not know how the medicine might affect different groups of newborns or what long‑term outcomes might be.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
