    "output": "**What do healthcare workers think about primary health care integration (PHC integration)?**  \n\n**Key messages**  \n- Healthcare workers describe PHC integration in many different ways.  They talk about combining services such as mental health, HIV/TB, maternal‑child health, chronic disease care, general primary care and specialised services, using approaches that range from full to partial merging of programmes.  No reports described serious harms from integration, but the evidence is very mixed and does not allow firm conclusions about overall impact.  \n- Most of the research comes from recent studies in a wide range of countries, yet some regions and certain types of workers are under‑represented, and many studies used only one‑time interviews or focus groups, limiting depth of insight.  \n- Future work should explore how the many ways of organising integration affect the day‑to‑day work of clinicians, managers and support staff, and should include more diverse settings and longer‑term observations to build clearer understanding.  \n\n### What is primary health care integration?  \nPrimary health care integration means delivering several health services together instead of running separate “vertical” programmes.  For example, a clinic might offer HIV testing, mental‑health counselling and maternal‑child care in the same visit, rather than sending patients to different locations for each service.  The idea is to make care easier for people and to use resources more efficiently, especially in places with limited health budgets.  \n\n### Why look at healthcare workers’ views?  \nPeople who work in health services—doctors, nurses, managers, community health workers and policy makers—play a key role in how new ways of delivering care are put into practice.  Their opinions, experiences and the challenges they face can shape whether integration works well or not.  Understanding these perspectives helps planners design reforms that fit real‑world conditions.  \n\n### What did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explored how healthcare workers perceive and experience PHC integration.  Specifically, we wanted to describe the range of settings, worker groups, service types and integration strategies that have been studied, so future researchers can see where evidence is strong and where gaps remain.  \n\n### What did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that reported healthcare workers’ views on PHC integration, counted and described their findings, and judged how confident we could be in the overall picture based on how the studies were carried out and reported.  \n\n### What did we find?  \n\nWe identified a large body of work that examined healthcare workers’ experiences across many countries, with roughly equal numbers from high‑income and low‑ or middle‑income settings.  The research covered 37 nations, but some countries (for example the United States, South Africa and Uganda) contributed many more studies than others, leaving gaps in other regions.  \n\nMost studies used cross‑sectional qualitative methods—interviews or focus‑group discussions held at a single point in time.  Only a few used longer‑term or ethnographic approaches that follow workers over months or years.  The studies described six main groups of health services being integrated:  \n\n- mental and behavioural health,  \n- HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health,  \n- maternal, women’s and child health,  \n- non‑communicable (chronic) diseases,  \n- general primary‑care services, and  \n- allied and specialised services.  \n\nWithin these groups, integration was reported as either “full” (all services merged) or “partial” (some services combined while others remain separate).  Three broad strategies were identified:  \n\n- **Horizontal integration** – linking services at the same level of care,  \n- **Service expansion** – adding new services to existing primary‑care sites, and  \n- **Service linkage** – creating referral pathways between different programmes.  \n\nA wide variety of workers took part in these integration efforts, including policy makers, senior and middle managers, frontline clinicians, allied health professionals, lay health workers and support staff.  The target populations they served also varied, ranging from children and pregnant women to people living with chronic infections or mental‑health conditions.  \n\nOverall, the evidence shows a highly diverse picture of how integration is understood and practiced, with many different models, strategies and worker experiences reported.  Because the studies are mostly short‑term snapshots and some records could not be fully examined, the picture remains incomplete.  \n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because most studies were simple interviews or focus groups that do not show how experiences change over time, many were small in size, and some records could not be fully classified.  This means the findings may not represent all settings or all types of health workers.  \n\n### How up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.  "
