    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs infliximab (a medicine that blocks TNF‑α) better than placebo for keeping Crohn’s disease in remission?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Infliximab probably reduces the chance that people with Crohn’s disease‑flare compared with no medicine, and adding infliximab to purine‑analogue medicines probably greatly lowers the chance of a flare; the review could not determine whether infliximab causes more or fewer serious side‑effects because the safety evidence is very uncertain.  \n- When infliximab is compared with a similar “biosimilar” medicine, the evidence suggests there may be little or no difference in preventing flares or serious side‑effects, but the confidence in these findings is low.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm how well infliximab works for different groups of people and to clarify its safety profile.  \n\nWhat is Crohn’s disease?  \nCrohn’s disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation in the gut, leading to pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People aim to keep the disease “in remission,” meaning they have few or no symptoms, because flares can damage the intestine and reduce quality of life.  \n\nWhy do we use medicines like infliximab?  \nInfliximab is a type of biologic medicine that binds to a protein called tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α) which is high in people with active‑type Crohn’s disease. By neutralising this protein, infliximab can calm gut inflammation. It is often given after an initial treatment has put the disease into remission, to help keep it there.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether infliximab, alone or together with other medicines, helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission better than a placebo (no active medicine) or other active treatments, and whether it causes any serious side‑effects.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared infliximab with placebo or other medicines, combined the results of those studies, and judged how confident we could be in the findings.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified nine studies that together included about 1,200 adults aged 18 to 69 years. The studies were carried out in many countries between 1999 and 2022. Most participants had not previously received biologic medicines, while a few had mixed treatment histories. All studies allowed people to keep taking other Crohn’s medicines at the same time. Four of the studies were funded by drug companies, two had mixed public‑and‑commercial funding, and two were publicly funded.  \n\n**Inflix vs placebo** – The evidence (moderate confidence) suggests infliximab probably reduces the chance of a disease flare compared with no active medicine.  \n\n**Infliximab + purine analogues vs purine analogues alone** – The evidence (moderate confidence) indicates that adding infliximab probably causes a large reduction in the chance of a flare for people already in remission.  \n\n**Infliximab vs biosimilar medicines** – The evidence (low confidence) suggests infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing flares or serious side‑effects, and it may be slightly less effective at keeping people from losing response, but the data are uncertain.  \n\n**Safety outcomes** – For most safety comparisons (serious side‑effects, withdrawals because of side‑effects) the evidence was very uncertain, so we cannot say whether infliximab is safer or riskier than the other options.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in many of the safety findings because the studies were small and may have been affected by bias (people and researchers sometimes knew which treatment was given). In addition, the results varied across studies, and some outcomes were not reported a lot, making the overall picture unclear.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.
