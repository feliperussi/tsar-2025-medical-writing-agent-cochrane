    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise and education programmes done at home) as effective as centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Home‑based programmes and centre‑based programmes give similar results for most outcomes. People do not die less, and their overall quality of life is about the same, and there are no clear differences in safety or cost.  \n- The evidence that home‑based programmes might improve exercise ability a little over the long term is only moderately reliable; most other findings are based on low‑confidence evidence.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed, especially to see whether any short‑term benefits last for many years and to test home‑based programmes in other heart conditions such as valve surgery or irregular heartbeat.  \n\nWhat is cardiac rehabilitation and why does it matter?  \nCardiac rehabilitation is a set of supervised exercises, education, and lifestyle advice that people start after a heart attack, heart surgery, or when they have heart failure. It helps them recover, feel stronger, and reduces the chance of another heart problem. Traditionally these programmes are run in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres.  \n\nWhy look at home‑based programmes?  \nHome‑based cardiac rehabilitation lets people do the same exercises and receive the same advice from their own home, often using phone calls, video calls, or apps. This can be useful when travelling to a centre is hard, such as during the COVID‑19 pandemic, or for people who live far from a centre.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare home‑based cardiac rehabilitation with centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation to see which one works better for: (1) preventing death, (2) improving the ability to exercise, (3) enhancing health‑related quality of life, and (4) changing heart‑related risk factors such as blood pressure or cholesterol.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases and trial registers for studies that directly compared home‑based and centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified about two dozen studies that together included roughly three thousand people who had a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure. The studies were carried out in many countries and were mostly short‑term, with only a few lasting longer than a year. The programmes compared were either traditional centre‑based sessions or home‑based programmes that sometimes used digital tools such as video calls or apps.  \n\nOverall, the evidence showed that home‑based cardiac rehabilitation makes little to no difference compared with centre‑based rehabilitation for the most important outcomes. People’s chances of dying, their overall quality of life, and the safety of the programmes appear similar, and the cost per person is also alike.  \n\nFor exercise ability, the evidence that home‑based programmes might improve performance a little over the long term is of moderate confidence. This suggests that, after a year or more, people doing the home programme may experience a small increase in how far or fast they can walk or cycle compared with those attending a centre.  \n\nHow confident are we in these findings?  \nWe have little confidence in most of the evidence because many of the studies were small and did not clearly describe how participants were assigned to the different groups or whether the people measuring outcomes knew which programme was used. These issues make it possible that the results could be affected by bias. For the longer‑term exercise benefit, our confidence is moderate because the few studies that looked beyond one year were better reported.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
