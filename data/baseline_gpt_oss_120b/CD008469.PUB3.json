    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs teaching children with asthma at home better than usual care or less‑intensive teaching?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Home‑based asthma education probably makes little or no difference to how often children need emergency‑room visits or a short course of oral steroids, and we are not confident about these results because the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- More intensive teaching at home may greatly lower the chance that a child is hospitalized for an asthma flare‑up, but we have little confidence in this finding because the studies were small and varied.  \n- Overall, the current research is limited and diverse; future studies should test clearly defined teaching programs and measure outcomes that matter to families, such as quality of life and school attendance.\n\nWhat is asthma and why does education matter?  \nAsthma is a chronic (long‑lasting) condition that makes the airways in the lungs narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects millions of people worldwide. Managing asthma well usually includes medicines, avoiding triggers (like dust or pollen), and learning how to use inhalers correctly. Teaching children and their families about these skills can help keep symptoms under control.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether asthma education delivered in the child’s home—by a teacher, nurse or other educator visiting the house—helps children more than the usual care they receive, education given outside the home, or a simpler version of home teaching.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared home‑based asthma teaching with other approaches. We combined the findings from the eligible studies and judged how much confidence we could place in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nThe review identified many studies that together involved thousands of children and teenagers with asthma, ranging from very young kids to older teens and covering mild to severe disease. The teaching programs varied a lot: some focused on specific skills like inhaler technique, others gave broader information about asthma. Control groups also differed, including usual care, waiting‑list groups, or shorter home sessions. All studies had some risk of bias because participants and educators often knew which group they were in.\n\n**Emergency‑room visits** – Home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to the number of children who end up in the emergency department, and we are not confident about this because the evidence is very uncertain.  \n\n**Need for oral steroids** – Home‑based education may make little or no difference to the need for a short course of oral steroids, but confidence is low.  \n\n**Quality of life** – We do not know whether teaching at home improves children’s overall quality of life, as the evidence is very uncertain.  \n\n**Hospital admission** – When the home program is more intensive (more sessions or longer visits) it may greatly reduce the chance that a child is hospitalized for an asthma flare‑up, but we have little confidence because the studies were small and varied.  \n\n**School attendance and symptom‑free days** – The evidence does not tell us whether home teaching changes the number of days children miss school or the number of days they feel symptom‑free; confidence is very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because many studies were small, the participants and teachers often knew which group they were in, and the programs differed a lot in content and length. These factors make it hard to know whether any observed effects are due to the teaching itself or to other differences between the groups.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
