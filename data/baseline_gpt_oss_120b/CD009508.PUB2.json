    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nWhat is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for women with urinary incontinence?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Some ways of doing PFMT may slightly improve how women feel about their bladder problems, while other approaches make little or no difference; serious side‑effects are rare, but a few women reported mild irritation from training devices.  \n- Doing PFMT more days each week might greatly improve quality of life, but the evidence for this is uncertain because it comes from only one small study.  \n- More well‑designed research is needed, especially studies that compare how often and how intensely women should train their pelvic floor muscles.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?  \nUrinary incontinence means losing urine unintentionally. It can happen when you cough, sneeze, run, feel a sudden urge, or all of the time. The condition affects many women, especially after having children, and can make daily activities and social life difficult.\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)?  \nPFMT is a set of exercises that strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. The exercises can be done by squeezing the pelvic floor muscles alone (direct PFMT) or together with other body movements (co‑ordinated or indirect training). PFMT can be taught in a clinic, at home, or through apps and written guides.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to learn whether different types of PFMT, the amount of training, or the way the training is delivered change how women feel about their urinary incontinence and whether any approach causes more side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched a large medical database and other sources for studies that compared one way of doing PFMT with another. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found 63 studies that together included 4,920 women aged about 45 to 65 years. Most women had stress‑type or mixed urinary incontinence and had not been treated before. The studies were carried out in many countries, mainly in middle‑ and high‑income settings. All studies used some form of direct PFMT (repeated, isolated pelvic floor squeezes) as a comparison.\n\nMain results  \n\nExercise type  \n- Coordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing the pelvic floor) may slightly improve quality of life, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n- Direct PFMT (just squeezing the pelvic floor) may moderately improve quality of life compared with indirect training that does not involve pelvic squeezes.  \n- Adding indirect exercises to direct PFMT probably makes little or no difference in quality of life.\n\nExercise dose  \n- Training without a resistance device may slightly improve quality of life, but we are very uncertain about this result.  \n- Doing PFMT on more days each week may greatly improve quality of life, though this finding comes from a single small study and is therefore uncertain.\n\nDelivery of training  \n- Having a therapist supervise PFMT in a clinic may slightly improve quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- Individual supervision versus group supervision probably makes little or no difference in quality of life.  \n- Supervision in a clinic compared with supervision through a mobile‑app may make little or no difference, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- Delivering PFMT instructions through an app may slightly improve quality of life compared with just written instructions.\n\nAdverse events  \nAcross nine studies, about 6 % of women reported mild side‑effects, mainly mild vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort linked to the use of a training device placed inside the vagina or rectum.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because the studies were small, some did not randomly assign women to the different training methods, and the results varied a lot between studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023."
