    "output": "What are the benefits, worries and reasons people use (or avoid) general health checks?  \n\n**Key messages**  \n- General health checks probably motivate many people to adopt healthier habits and give them reassurance that their health is being looked at objectively; however, some people may avoid them because they fear bad news or worry about costs.  \n- Trusted, skilled and culturally aware health‑check providers probably encourage attendance, while lack of time, unclear insurance coverage and limited access probably reduce it.  \n- Because many findings come from a limited number of studies or from specific settings, we have only little confidence in some ideas—especially those about cultural influences and how policies are decided—so more research is needed.  \n\n**What are general health checks?**  \nGeneral health checks are appointments where people who feel fine can have several screening tests (for at least two diseases or risk factors) to see how healthy they are. They are offered by national programmes, private companies or workplaces and aim to spot problems early so that illness and death might be reduced.  \n\n**Why look at people’s views on health checks?**  \nA 2019 review of effectiveness studies found that these checks do not clearly lower death rates or heart‑related problems. That result makes it important to understand what different groups—policy makers, health‑care managers, doctors, nurses and the people who might attend—think about the value, the challenges and the reasons for using or not using these checks.  \n\n**What did we do?**  \nWe searched two large databases for studies that used interviews or focus groups to explore views on commissioning, delivering and taking up general health checks, up to August 2022. We combined the findings from the selected studies and judged how much confidence we could have in each finding.  \n\n**What did we find?**  \nWe identified 146 eligible studies and chose 36 that gave rich, varied perspectives from many countries. Most were from high‑income European nations, but about a third came from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia and Latin America. The studies were carried out in primary‑care clinics, community centres, workplaces and other community settings. They included the views of clients (people who attended or considered attending), health‑care providers and health‑care managers or commissioners.  \n\n*Individual‑level findings*  \n- General health checks probably motivate people to change their lifestyles.  \n- General health checks probably give people reassurance that a professional has objectively assessed their health.  \n- Some people may be reluctant to attend because they fear negative results or rely on symptom‑based care.  \n- People’s ideas about disease, risk and prevention influence whether they attend.  \n- Some people probably feel a duty to their families and society to stay healthy through health checks.  \n- Having trusted health‑care providers probably encourages attendance, while bad experiences with unqualified providers probably discourage it.  \n- Easy access, clear invitation systems and awareness campaigns probably increase attendance; lack of time or worries about insurance coverage probably reduce it.  \n\n*Intervention‑level findings*  \n- People probably attend more when health‑check providers are skilled and understand their cultural background.  \n- Practical problems such as competing curative care, staff shortages, limited resources, technical glitches and reimbursement issues probably make it harder to deliver health checks.  \n- Offering health checks in innovative or diverse settings probably improves access for more people.  \n- People may like a comprehensive package of many tests, but we are not sure.  \n- Tailoring checks to an individual’s specific health risks may be helpful, but evidence is uncertain.  \n- Different stakeholder groups have different ideas about how effective health checks are.  \n- Good information, invitation letters and educational approaches probably raise awareness of health‑check availability and benefits.  \n- Explaining test results and giving clear recommendations may be important for clients, but we are uncertain.  \n\n*Contextual findings*  \n- Cultural background, social norms, religion, gender and language may shape how people view prevention and disease, affecting whether they use health checks, but we have little confidence in this idea.  \n- Policymakers probably think that a supportive political climate and backing from various groups are needed to start health‑check programmes, yet evidence on this is limited.  \n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**  \nWe are moderately confident in many findings because the studies were reasonably well done, but they often involved small numbers of people or varied settings. We have little confidence in some ideas—especially those about cultural influences and policy decisions—because the evidence comes from few studies or from specific contexts, making it hard to be sure.  \n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**  \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
