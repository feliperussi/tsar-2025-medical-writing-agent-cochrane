    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs giving loop diuretics continuously better than giving them as a quick injection for people with acute heart failure?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Current evidence does not show that a continuous drip of loop diuretics is better than a quick injection for people with acute heart failure. The two ways seem to have similar effects on survival, length of hospital stay, chances of returning to the hospital, and kidney problems, and we are not sure whether one method helps people lose more weight than the other. No clear increase in side‑effects was reported.  \n- The studies we looked at were small, sometimes had design problems, and gave mixed results, so we cannot be confident that any small differences are real‑world facts.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to find out if one method truly helps people recover faster, stay out of the hospital longer, or avoids kidney injury.\n\nWhat is acute heart failure?  \nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a sudden worsening of the heart’s ability to pump blood. It often causes fluid to build up in the lungs or legs, making breathing hard and causing swelling. People with AHF usually need urgent treatment in hospital.\n\nWhy do doctors use loop diuretics?  \nLoop diuretics are medicines that help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid by increasing urine output. Removing the excess fluid can relieve breathing problems and reduce swelling. Doctors can give these medicines through a quick injection (a “bolus”) or through a slow, continuous drip (an “infusion”).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous infusion works better than giving them as a quick injection for adults with acute heart failure. Specifically, we looked at weight loss, death rates, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and kidney injury.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared continuous infusion with bolus injection of loop diuretics in adults with acute heart failure. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified seven studies that together included about 680 people with severe acute heart failure. The studies were carried out in hospitals across North America, Europe, and Asia. Participants were adults with very serious symptoms (New York Heart Association class III or IV). The studies compared a steady drip of loop diuretics with a series of quick injections. Funding sources varied, and some studies had a higher risk of bias than others.\n\nMain results  \n- Weight loss: It is unclear if a continuous drip helps people lose more weight than a quick injection.  \n- Death rates: Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to the chance of dying.  \n- Length of hospital stay: It is unclear if a continuous drip shortens the time people stay in the hospital.  \n- Readmission to hospital: Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to the chance of returning to the hospital after discharge.  \n- Acute kidney injury: Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney problems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, some had design problems that could affect the results, and the findings were not consistent across all studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
