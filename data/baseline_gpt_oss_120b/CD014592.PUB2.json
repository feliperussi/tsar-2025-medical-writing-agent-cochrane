    "output": "Does estrogen therapy (hormone medicine) improve pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women?\n\nKey messages\n- There is not enough good evidence to know whether estrogen therapy helps or harms women with pelvic organ prolapse. Some small studies suggest it might lower vaginal irritation when used together with a pessary and might lower urinary‑tract infections after surgery, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- No studies looked at estrogen alone compared with doing nothing, a placebo, pelvic‑floor exercises, a pessary by itself, or surgery by itself.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out if estrogen works, how safe it is, and whether it is worth the cost.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) means that the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina. It happens in about half of women over 50 who have given birth. The condition can cause a feeling of heaviness, bulging, or trouble with bladder and bowel control. Women often try pelvic‑floor exercises, pessaries (devices placed in the vagina), or surgery to manage it.\n\nWhy might estrogen be used?\nEstrogen is a hormone that helps keep the tissues of the vagina and pelvic area healthy. After menopause, estrogen levels drop, and some doctors think adding estrogen could make the tissues stronger and reduce symptoms of POP. Estrogen can be applied as a cream, tablet, or ring (topical) or taken as a pill (systemic).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to learn whether estrogen, used alone or together with other treatments, improves POP symptoms in postmenopausal women, and whether it causes any unwanted side effects. We also looked for information about the cost‑effectiveness of estrogen use.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared estrogen (by itself or with other treatments) against placebo, no treatment, or other options. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that together included about 1,000 women with POP. The studies were done in several countries and mostly lasted a few weeks to months. Most studies had problems with how they were run – for example, many did not hide the treatment from the women or the doctors, and some did not report all the results they measured. Because of these problems, the overall confidence in the evidence is low.\n\nThe studies fell into two groups:\n- Three studies looked at estrogen cream used together with a pessary compared with a pessary alone.\n- Eleven studies looked at estrogen used together with surgery compared with surgery alone.\nNo study examined estrogen by itself compared with doing nothing, a placebo, pelvic‑floor exercises, a pessary alone, or surgery alone.\n\nThe findings suggest that:\n- Using estrogen cream together with a pessary may lead to fewer vaginal side‑effects, but we are not sure because the evidence is uncertain.\n- Using estrogen together with surgery may reduce the chance of getting a urinary‑tract infection after the operation, but again the evidence is uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies often did not hide the treatment from participants, and many were very small. These issues make it hard to know whether the observed benefits are real or just due to chance.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
