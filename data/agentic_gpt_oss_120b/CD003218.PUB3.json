    "output": "Do stimulant medicines (drugs that increase alertness) improve daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a genetic muscle disorder)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n\n- Psychostimulant medicines (drugs that increase alertness) may reduce how sleepy people with myotonic dystrophy feel, according to self‑reported questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The evidence is limited and we do not know if they improve objective sleep tests or increase side‑effects.\n- The trials only examined short‑term use (up to four weeks) in a small number of adults. No children were studied and we do not know whether benefits or harms persist over longer periods.\n- Because the current evidence is uncertain, we need more well‑designed randomised trials that assess both short‑ and long‑term benefits and harms of psychostimulants for daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is excessive daytime sleepiness a problem?\n\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic muscle disorder that causes muscle weakness, difficulty relaxing muscles, and many other health issues. A common complaint is hypersomnia – feeling very sleepy during the day even after a normal night’s sleep. This excessive daytime sleepiness makes everyday tasks, work and social life harder and reduces quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about psychostimulant medicines?\n\nWe wanted to know whether psychostimulant drugs improve daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We looked for randomised trials that compared a psychostimulant with a placebo or no treatment and measured objective sleep tests (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test and Multiple Sleep Latency Test), self‑reported sleepiness scales (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), quality of life and any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\n\nWe searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP up to 5 January 2023. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe identified six short‑term randomised controlled trials that enrolled 136 adults (aged 18‑70 years) with genetically or electromyographically confirmed myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All trials tested psychostimulant agents, most often modafinil, against placebo or no treatment. The studies lasted up to four weeks and used a cross‑over design in five trials.\n\nWhat are the main results on sleepiness?\n\nWe could not confirm that psychostimulants improve objective sleepiness measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. However, participants reported feeling less sleepy on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (average reduction of about 2.5 points). The impact on quality of life remains uncertain, and psychostimulants may increase the chance of adverse events, although the evidence is not strong.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the trials involved few participants, used different methods and only examined short‑term outcomes. No data are available for children or for long‑term effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to the January 2023 search.\n"
