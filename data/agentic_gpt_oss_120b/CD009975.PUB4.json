    "output": "Is video laryngoscopy (using a tiny camera to see the airway) more effective than direct laryngoscopy (looking straight at the airway) for inserting breathing tubes in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that video laryngoscopy probably increases the chance of successful tube placement on the first try and may reduce throat injuries (airway trauma) compared with direct laryngoscopy, but it does not clearly shorten the time needed for the procedure.\n- The evidence is very uncertain about whether video laryngoscopy lowers the risk of low oxygen levels (desaturation) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia) during intubation, and no data were reported on other harms.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm these findings, to assess longer‑term safety, and to compare different video‑laryngoscopy devices in newborns.\n\nWhy is securing the airway in newborns important?\nWhen a baby is born, it sometimes needs help to breathe. The most reliable way to do this is by placing a small tube into the windpipe (the trachea) – a procedure called endotracheal intubation. This tube lets us give oxygen or ventilation directly to the lungs. If we do not place the tube quickly and correctly, the baby can lose oxygen, develop a slow heart rate, or suffer other serious complications. Finding the safest and most efficient way to insert the tube is therefore critical in delivery rooms and neonatal intensive‑care units.\n\nWhat is videolaryngoscopy and how does it differ from direct laryngoscopy?\nTo see the opening of the windpipe (the glottis), clinicians traditionally use a direct laryngoscope – a metal blade that requires them to look straight at the glottis. Videolaryngoscopy uses a similar blade but adds a tiny camera that shows a video of the airway on a screen. This can give a clearer view, especially in very small patients like newborns, and may make it easier to place the tube on the first try.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared video laryngoscopy with the traditional direct laryngoscope in newborns (aged 0‑28 days). Specifically, we asked whether the video‑assisted device:\n- reduces the time needed to place the tube,\n- reduces the number of attempts required, and\n- increases the chance of success on the first attempt.\nWe also examined whether the video method might lower the risk of low oxygen levels, a slow heart rate, or injury to the airway.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?\nWe searched major databases and trial registries for randomised trials that compared video and direct laryngoscopy in newborns. We combined the results for intubation time, number of attempts, and first‑attempt success, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised trials that recorded 759 intubation attempts in newborns worldwide. All trials compared video laryngoscopes (such as C‑MAC, Airtraq, or Glidescope) with direct laryngoscopes.\n- Video laryngoscopy probably increases first‑attempt success by about 14 more babies per 100 compared with direct laryngoscopy.\n- It probably makes little or no difference to the total number of attempts or the time needed for a successful intubation.\n- It probably leads to a large reduction in airway trauma.\n- We remain uncertain about its effect on desaturation or bradycardia, and it probably makes little or no difference to the lowest oxygen level recorded during the attempt.\n\nDoes videolaryngoscopy improve first‑attempt success and reduce airway injury?\nOur findings suggest that video laryngoscopy likely improves the chance of success on the first try and reduces throat injuries, although the evidence is of low certainty for most outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants and clinicians often knew which device was used, and the studies were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated our search in November 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
