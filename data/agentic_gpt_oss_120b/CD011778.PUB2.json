    "output": "Does adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑based antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning improve gum disease and dental‑implant disease?\n\nKey messages –\n- Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑based treatment that kills bacteria – to the usual deep cleaning of the gums (called subgingival cleaning, where tiny tools clean below the gum line) does not show clear or important benefits for gum disease, and we are not sure whether any tiny changes are real. We did not find any harmful effects.\n- No studies looked at aPDT for peri‑implantitis (inflammation around dental implants with bone loss). Only one very small study examined peri‑implant mucositis (inflammation without bone loss). That study did not report results after six months, so we still do not know whether aPDT helps implant‑related disease.\n- We need larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer, especially those with implant‑related disease, to find out if aPDT really helps and to check any risks.\n\nWhy are gum disease and implant disease important?\nPeriodontitis and peri‑implant diseases are long‑lasting gum infections that cause inflammation around natural teeth or dental implants. If they are not treated, the inflammation can slowly destroy the bone and tissue that hold teeth or implants in place, leading to tooth loss or implant failure. Tiny communities of bacteria (called sub‑gingival biofilm) hide deep in the pockets between the gum and the tooth or implant, making them hard to reach.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registers up to 14 February 2024. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared subgingival cleaning with extra antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to cleaning alone or to a fake (placebo) light treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 50 trials involving 1,407 participants with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease. All trials reported outcomes six months after treatment, measuring probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, gum recession and adverse effects. The aPDT protocols were either a single session (39 studies) or multiple sessions (11 studies). No trial directly addressed peri‑implantitis, and the single small trial on peri‑implant mucositis did not provide six‑month data.\n\nAdding aPDT to the usual cleaning probably makes little or no difference to pocket depth, bleeding on probing, attachment level or gum recession after six months. The evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain, so any small changes may not be real. Moderate‑certainty evidence suggests that aPDT does not increase side‑effects; most studies reported no adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies provided data for every outcome we wanted. The studies involved different types of people and used varied interventions. Most studies were very small, which reduces certainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched up to 14 February 2024, so the evidence is current to that date."
