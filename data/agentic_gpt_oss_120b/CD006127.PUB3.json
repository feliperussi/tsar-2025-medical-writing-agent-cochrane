    "output": "Does lowering blood pressure reduce the risk of diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy)?\n\nWhat are the main messages?\n- Lowering blood pressure can modestly lower the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over about five years, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure (hypertension). The evidence is of moderate quality, and the main side effect reported is low blood pressure (hypotension).\n- The benefit was strongest in people with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Studies in people without hypertension did not show a clear advantage.\n- Future research should look at effects beyond five years, examine whether blood‑pressure lowering can slow worsening of existing retinopathy, and better assess risks such as low blood pressure, especially in patients without hypertension.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is damage to the tiny blood vessels in the eye that can happen to people with diabetes. Over time these vessels may leak, swell, or close, leading to blurry vision, loss of sight, and even blindness. It is one of the most common eye complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Good control of blood sugar helps prevent this damage, and doctors have also suggested that keeping blood pressure (the force of blood against artery walls) in a healthy range might protect the eyes further, although studies have shown mixed results.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to gather and summarise all high‑quality randomised trials that compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care, or no treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We wanted to know whether tighter blood‑pressure control reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy, slows its progression, preserves visual acuity (sharpness of vision), and what side‑effects, quality‑of‑life impacts, or costs might occur.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases and trial registries up to 3 September 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results from 29 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 27 185 participants (4 620 with type 1 and 22 565 with type 2 diabetes) from many regions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nMore intensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over five years. It may also lower the combined risk of developing or worsening retinopathy, although we are less certain about this effect. For people who already have retinopathy, more intensive control probably makes little or no difference to its progression, to the risk of advanced retinopathy (proliferative diabetic retinopathy), swelling of the central retina (clinically significant macular edema), bleeding inside the eye (vitreous haemorrhage), or loss of visual acuity.\nWe also found that more intensive control probably reduces the risk of death slightly, but it may increase the chance of low blood pressure. The certainty of the death finding is moderate, while the certainty of the low‑blood‑pressure finding is low.\nThe benefit was strongest in participants with type 2 diabetes who had hypertension. Studies in people without hypertension did not show a clear advantage.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because the trials varied in participants, interventions, and outcomes, and many were small or few in number. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or outcomes beyond five years, and it does not clearly show benefit for people without hypertension.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the September 2021 search."
