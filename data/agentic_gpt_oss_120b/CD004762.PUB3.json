    "output": "How effective and safe are medicines for treating muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders (muscle disorders that cause stiffness)?\n\nKey messages\n- Mexiletine can reduce muscle stiffness and may slightly improve hand‑grip strength in non‑dystrophic myotonia. It also shortens the time muscles take to relax. Common side‑effects are stomach upset, tiredness and headache.\n- Lamotrigine may speed up muscle relaxation and improve overall wellbeing in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but it can cause headache, fatigue and rash. Other drugs such as phenytoin, imipramine and similar agents showed little or uncertain benefit because the studies were small and of lower quality.\n- More large, high‑quality trials are needed, especially for myotonic dystrophy and for drugs that have not shown clear benefit, to understand long‑term effects and who responds best.\n\nWhat is myotonia and why does it matter?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles take longer than normal to relax after they have been used. This can cause stiffness, painful cramps, sudden \"locking\" of the muscles, fatigue and reduced ability to move around. The problem is most common in two groups of inherited muscle disorders:\n- Non‑dystrophic myotonia – a genetic problem that mainly affects the muscle’s ion channels (the tiny gates that control the flow of electricity in muscle cells) and leads mainly to myotonia.\n- Myotonic dystrophy – a broader disease that also causes progressive muscle weakness, heart rhythm problems, cataracts and other systemic issues.\nBecause the symptoms can be severe and disabling, people with these conditions often need treatment to improve muscle relaxation and quality of life.\n\nWhat medicines are currently used to treat myotonia?\nDoctors have tried several types of drugs to reduce the delayed muscle relaxation, including:\n- Sodium‑channel blockers such as mexiletine – medicines that calm the over‑active electrical signals in muscle cells.\n- Tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine and prednisone – other drug classes that have shown some benefit in small studies.\nThese treatments aim to lessen stiffness and improve daily functioning, but the evidence for how well they work and how safe they are has been uncertain.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe asked two main questions:\n1. How effective are drug treatments at reducing the symptoms of myotonia as reported by the people taking the medicines?\n2. How well are these drugs tolerated, meaning what side‑effects they cause and how they affect overall quality of life?\nTo answer these questions we looked for randomised controlled trials – the most reliable type of study – that compared any drug for myotonia with a placebo, no treatment or another active drug.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases, trial registers, reports that are not published in journals (often called “grey literature”), and we consulted disease experts and drug manufacturers. We combined the results and used a standard system (GRADE) to judge how trustworthy the evidence is.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 17 double‑blind or single‑blind trials that together enrolled 392 participants (219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non‑dystrophic myotonia).\nMexiletine\n- In non‑dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine likely reduces muscle stiffness, shortens the time muscles take to relax, and slightly improves hand‑grip strength. It may also lower abnormal electrical activity in the muscles. We have moderate confidence in these results, meaning the evidence is fairly reliable but not definitive.\n- In myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine likely shortens hand‑grip relaxation time – the time it takes for a hand‑grip to return to normal after squeezing – but we do not have clear evidence that it improves overall clinical myotonia scores.\nLamotrigine\n- In non‑dystrophic myotonia, lamotrigine likely speeds up muscle relaxation and probably improves quality of life. Common side‑effects were headache, fatigue and rash.\nOther medicines\n- Drugs such as phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide and several others showed little or uncertain benefit because the trials were small and of lower quality.\nCommon side‑effects across the medicines included stomach upset, tiredness, headache, fatigue and rash.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in the overall evidence because many studies were very small, some participants may have known which treatment they received (which can influence results), and not all trials reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence up to March 2023."
