    "output": "Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new decay on the roots of teeth – we have moderate‑certainty (a fair amount of confidence) evidence for this benefit. It may also help stop existing cavities in baby teeth, but for most other outcomes the evidence is uncertain and we do not yet know how often the teeth turn dark (staining).\n- Compared with fluoride varnish (a coating applied to teeth to prevent decay), SDF shows little or no extra benefit for preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and evidence for other outcomes, including adult teeth, remains very uncertain.\n- Most studies were small and not blinded because the treatment darkens the tooth, so we need larger, well‑designed trials to confirm benefits, measure staining, and compare SDF directly with other common treatments.\n\nWhy is dental caries a major health problem?\nTooth decay, also called dental caries (tooth decay), is the most common disease worldwide. When decay is not treated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, and affect confidence and social life. Decay can affect baby (primary) teeth, adult (permanent) teeth, and the roots of teeth. Because it is so common, finding simple and affordable ways to stop new decay or to stop existing decay from getting worse is a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how is it used?\nSilver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that we can paint onto a tooth. It contains a small amount of silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which strengthens the tooth surface. The treatment is quick, does not need drilling, and can be applied by a dentist or a trained health worker. A known side‑effect is that the treated part of the tooth can turn a dark colour, which may be a concern for appearance.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF helps prevent new cavities or stops existing cavities from getting worse in both baby and adult teeth. We compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, and with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment. We also looked at side‑effects, pain, and changes in how the teeth look after treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the results and judged our confidence in the findings using Cochrane and GRADE methods. The studies used either a parallel‑group design (all teeth in a participant received the same treatment) or a split‑mouth design (one side of the mouth received SDF while the other side received the comparison treatment).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 trials that together enrolled 13,036 participants (12,020 children and 1,016 older adults). The trials tested different concentrations, frequencies and durations of SDF and compared it with placebo or no treatment, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment.\n\nDoes SDF reduce new root caries?\nYes. The evidence shows that SDF probably reduces the development of new root caries compared with doing nothing, and we have moderate‑certainty evidence for this benefit.\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?\nMany studies allowed participants to see which treatment they received because SDF causes a colour change, so the trials were not blinded. Small sample sizes also reduced reliability. These factors lower our confidence in most results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe included all studies published up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects everything that was available at that time.\n\nWhat are the implications?\nWe cannot be sure how well SDF works for most outcomes, and we do not know how often staining happens. Better‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm the benefits, assess side‑effects, and compare SDF directly with other common treatments."
