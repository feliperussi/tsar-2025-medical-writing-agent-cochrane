    "output": "Do medicines (such as proton‑pump inhibitors) help treat gastro‑oesophageal reflux (acid reflux) in infants and children?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Medicines that lower stomach acid – proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2‑antagonists – have not shown a clear benefit for relieving reflux symptoms in infants or older children, and we are very unsure about the evidence. No specific harms were reported in the studies we found.\n- Small studies in some age groups sometimes suggested a modest improvement, but the overall data are limited, inconsistent, and do not give reliable information about healing of the oesophagus or long‑term outcomes.\n- Because the current evidence is weak and incomplete, we need well‑designed randomised trials with more participants and longer follow‑up, especially in groups such as preterm infants and children with neurological conditions.\n\nWhat is gastro‑oesophageal reflux and why does it matter for babies and children?\nGastro‑oesophageal reflux (often shortened to GOR) is when the contents of the stomach flow back up the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (the oesophagus). This can cause spitting up, coughing, irritability and discomfort. About half of babies under three months experience GOR, and it usually improves as the child grows. In some older children, or in babies with other health problems, reflux can continue, affect growth, sleep and quality of life. When reflux causes enough symptoms that doctors decide treatment is needed, it is called gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). To try to reduce the acid that comes up, doctors sometimes prescribe medicines such as proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs, which lower stomach acid) or H2‑antagonists (another type of acid‑reducing drug).\n\nWhat did we want to find out about medicines for reflux in children?\nWe wanted to know whether these acid‑reducing medicines actually work for infants and children. We compared each medicine with a placebo – a pill that looks the same but has no active drug – or with another medicine. Our main questions were: do the medicines reduce symptoms that children and parents notice, do they change the amount of acid that reaches the oesophagus, and are there any side‑effects? We also examined how confident we can be in the results.\n\nHow did we carry out the review?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared acid‑reducing medicines with placebo or another drug in children up to 16 years old. We included studies published up to September 2022. Two reviewers checked each study, extracted the data and rated the confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 trials that included 2,251 infants and children with reflux, from newborns up to 16 years old. The trials tested PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, and one H2‑antagonist (ranitidine). The evidence from these trials is very uncertain.\n- Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and we are very unsure about this result. When we compare it with ranitidine, the data hint at a small benefit, but the certainty is still low.\n- Esomeprazole appears to have little or no effect on symptoms in newborns, with great uncertainty.\n- In older children, different doses of rabeprazole and pantoprazole also show little or no difference in symptom improvement, and the certainty is low.\nOverall, we do not have reliable evidence that any of these medicines help children with reflux.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies involved different types of participants, used different ways of giving the medicines, and were generally very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to September 2022."
