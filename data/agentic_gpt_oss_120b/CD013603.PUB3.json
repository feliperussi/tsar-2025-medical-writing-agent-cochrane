    "output": "What are health workers' views and experiences of combining (integrating) primary health care services?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers see both benefits, such as more coordinated care, and challenges, like higher workload and unclear roles; the review did not find consistent evidence that integration always helps or harms.\n– The evidence comes from 184 studies in 191 papers across many countries and service areas (for example mental health, HIV/TB, maternal health, non‑communicable diseases). Most studies used one‑time interviews; fewer used longer‑term designs, and some regions are under‑represented.\n– Because the literature is diverse and often shallow, we recommend future research to use longer‑term, in‑depth qualitative methods and clear conceptual frameworks to understand how different integration designs affect health workers and overall impact.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health care services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people when they need medical help. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered as separate \"vertical\" programmes – for example one programme for HIV, another for tuberculosis, and another for maternal health. Integrating these services means delivering them together as a coordinated package. This approach is promoted worldwide because it can make health systems more efficient, improve the quality of care, and help achieve universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can get the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.\n\nWhat do we know about healthcare workers' views on this integration?\nHealthcare workers – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers and policy makers – are the people who actually put integration plans into practice. Their attitudes, experiences and the challenges they face can strongly influence whether integration works well. Studies on this topic are very diverse: they come from many countries, use different research methods, and focus on a wide range of health‑service streams such as mental health, HIV/TB, maternal health, non‑communicable diseases and general PHC. This diversity makes it hard to see a single overall picture.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that looks at healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. By describing the types of studies, the countries involved, the health‑service areas examined and the integration strategies used, we wanted to create a clear overview of the evidence base. This overview can help researchers and decision‑makers understand how the variety in study designs, settings and contexts might affect the way health workers influence the implementation and impact of integrated primary health care.\n\nHow did we gather and analyse the evidence?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary health‑care integration. We extracted key information, counted studies for each indicator and turned those counts into proportions. We also added descriptive details about study methods, country settings, intervention types, integration strategies, participating workers and client groups. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 184 primary studies reported in 191 papers. The studies included policymakers, senior managers, frontline clinicians, allied health professionals, lay workers and support staff. They were conducted in 37 countries, about half in high‑income and half in low‑ and middle‑income settings; the United States, South Africa and Uganda were the most common locations.\nIntegration efforts covered many service streams – mental health, HIV, tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, non‑communicable diseases, general primary care and specialised services. Researchers described integration as either full or partial and used three main strategies:\n– horizontal integration (bringing different services together at the same level of care),\n– service expansion (adding new services to existing ones),\n– service linkage (connecting existing services so they refer patients to each other).\nWe do not know how many people took part in each study, how long the integration lasted, or how the projects were funded, which limits our confidence in the findings. Because the evidence comes from many different countries, service areas and types of workers, we cannot say whether integrating primary health care actually improves outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different types of workers and used varied delivery methods. They do not cover all people or outcomes we need, and most studies were small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe updated the evidence to include studies searched up to July 2020."
