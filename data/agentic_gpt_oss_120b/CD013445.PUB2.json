    "output": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nKey messages\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a stone‑removal procedure done through a small incision in the back – may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, while serious (major) complications appear similar to retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\n- PCNL may keep you in hospital about one day longer than RIRS.\n- The evidence is limited; we need larger, higher‑quality trials that also look at quality of life and costs.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and lead to infection. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common options include:\n- Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. The tube size is measured in French gauge (Fr); larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL, while smaller tubes (15–23 Fr or <15 Fr) are mini‑ or micro‑PCNL.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n- Gives a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Stone‑free rate: About 10 more patients per 100 are stone‑free after PCNL than after RIRS.\n- Major complications: Serious complications are almost the same for both procedures – PCNL results in about 6 fewer major complications per 1,000 patients compared with RIRS.\n- Need for secondary procedures: Roughly 15 fewer patients per 100 need another procedure after PCNL.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may add about one extra day in the hospital compared with RIRS.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to this risk.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany of the studies were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and follow‑up was limited. Because of these shortcomings, we have low confidence in most results.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nPCNL gives a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. We do not have data on how either procedure affects daily living or quality of life.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
