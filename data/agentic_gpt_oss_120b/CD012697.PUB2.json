    "output": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non‑invasive brain stimulation) as effective and better tolerated than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages:\n\n- Based on the only study we found, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) – a non‑invasive brain stimulation using magnetic fields – works about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) – an electric shock treatment – for overall symptoms of schizophrenia. The study suggests MST may cause fewer problems with remembering things later. It may also improve thinking abilities. However, the evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had several problems.\n- The study did not show clear differences between MST and ECT in the number of people who stopped treatment because of side‑effects or because it did not help. Our confidence in these findings is low.\n- More high‑quality, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm whether MST truly offers similar benefits and fewer cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat makes schizophrenia a serious health problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental illness that can make thinking, feeling and social interaction very difficult. It often starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime, affecting work, relationships and overall quality of life. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and could it help people who do not respond to usual medicines?\nMST is a newer, non‑invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to create brief, controlled seizures in the brain. It works like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which uses electric shock, but the magnetic stimulus can be targeted more precisely. Researchers hope MST might improve schizophrenia symptoms while causing fewer memory problems and fewer thinking‑ability side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether MST reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia and whether it is safe and tolerable for patients. In other words, we compared MST – either alone or together with standard care (the usual medicines and support) – to other treatments such as ECT. We looked for any differences in effectiveness or side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies that compared MST with other treatments for schizophrenia. We combined the results and rated how confident we are in the evidence using standard methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one small randomised controlled trial that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The four‑week study compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. We did not have details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding sources. Because the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot tell whether MST improves overall mental state, positive symptoms (like hallucinations), negative symptoms (like reduced motivation), memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the study was very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2022."
