    "output": "Do education programmes (structured teaching sessions) improve health outcomes for people with chronic kidney disease (long‑term kidney problems) and diabetes?\n\nKey messages:\n- Education programmes probably lower blood‑sugar levels. They reduce HbA1c by about 0.4 % (HbA1c measures average blood sugar over the past few months). No clear benefits or harms were seen for other major outcomes.\n- The programmes may increase patients’ knowledge about diabetes and boost confidence in managing the condition, but these effects are uncertain and may not be sustained over time.\n- Because the studies are few and small, we need larger, longer trials to find out whether education can improve kidney function, heart health, quality of life, and to detect any adverse effects.\n\nWhat is the health problem for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\nPeople who have both chronic kidney disease (CKD – a long‑term loss of kidney function) and diabetes (a high blood‑sugar condition) must follow very detailed daily routines. They need to take medicines, monitor blood sugar, watch their diet, and attend regular medical appointments. Sticking to these plans is hard, and many people do not manage it well. Poor management can raise blood‑sugar levels, increase cholesterol, and speed up loss of kidney function. Success depends not only on medicines but also on how well patients understand and manage their condition.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether education programmes for adults with CKD and diabetes improve health outcomes. Specifically, we looked at whether the programmes lower HbA1c, improve cholesterol numbers, increase patients’ knowledge and confidence in managing diabetes, and affect important results such as kidney failure, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, and overall safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared an education programme with routine care in adults with CKD and diabetes. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed their quality, and extracted data. We combined the results using standard statistical methods and judged the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials that together enrolled 840 adults with CKD and diabetes. Participants included people on dialysis, people with moderately increased albuminuria (higher than normal protein in urine), and people with type‑2 diabetes and advanced kidney disease. All trials compared an education programme – delivered by nurses, pharmacists or other educators through verbal, written, audio‑recorded or computer‑aided formats – with routine care. Follow‑up ranged from five weeks to 18 months.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\nEducation programmes probably lower blood‑sugar levels by about 0.4 % (HbA1c) compared with routine care. They may also lower total cholesterol and LDL (low‑density lipoprotein) cholesterol a little. Participants often reported better knowledge about diabetes and greater confidence in managing it, and some showed modest changes in diet and home glucose monitoring. These benefits are uncertain and may not be sustained over time. We did not find clear benefits or harms for outcomes such as death, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, or kidney failure; the evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain. Adding education to team‑based care made little or no difference to blood‑sugar control, kidney outcomes, blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the results, but the studies were small and participants often knew which group they were in, which could influence the outcomes. Many outcomes relied on self‑reported measures, which are less reliable.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to July 2024."
