    "output": "Do primary health‑care workers (e.g., nurses) and community health workers help prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑and middle‑income countries?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Primary health‑care workers (e.g., nurses) and community health workers (locally trained aides) can deliver mental‑health promotion and prevention programmes that lead to small improvements in anxiety (worry), depression (persistent low mood), distress/PTSD (post‑traumatic stress disorder) symptoms and quality of life, and may reduce functional impairment (difficulty doing daily activities) and adverse events (unwanted side effects). No increase in harms was reported, but the evidence is limited and of low quality.\n- These modest benefits appear across universal prevention (offered to everyone), selective prevention (targeting higher‑risk groups) and indicated prevention (for people showing early signs), and in both adults and children, although the size of the effect varies between studies.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm which approaches work best and to understand any potential harms or costs.\n\nWhy is mental health promotion and prevention needed in low‑and middle‑income countries?\nMany people in low‑and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience anxiety (worry), depression (persistent low mood), or post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD – distress after a traumatic event). These conditions lower quality of life, limit work or study, and raise the risk of other health problems. LMICs often have few trained mental‑health professionals, uneven resource distribution, and strong stigma that stops people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, researchers look for ways to prevent mental disorders before they start. They test universal prevention (for everyone), selective prevention (for higher‑risk groups), and indicated prevention (for early signs). One promising approach is task‑shifting – sharing tasks that specialists usually do with trained primary‑level or community health workers.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about primary‑level and community worker interventions?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes delivered by primary‑level or community health workers can effectively promote mental well‑being and prevent mental disorders in LMICs. Specifically, we examined (1) how well these programmes improve mental‑health outcomes for adults and children across universal, selective and indicated prevention, and (2) whether using these workers affects health‑care use and costs compared with usual care or other controls.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention programmes with any control condition in LMICs. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 113 studies that together included 32,992 participants from low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income countries. Primary‑level health workers delivered the programmes in 38 studies, community workers delivered them in 71 studies, both types delivered them in 2 studies, and the worker type was not reported in 2 studies. The interventions were classified as universal prevention/promotion in 22 studies, selective prevention in 36 studies and indicated prevention in 55 studies.\nOverall, the programmes probably provide small mental‑health benefits. In adults, the programmes probably reduce anxiety a little and probably reduce depressive symptoms a little when used for selective prevention; they may also slightly lower distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events and modestly improve functional ability. In children, the programmes may slightly improve quality of life and may reduce adverse events, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For selective prevention in children, the programmes probably reduce depressive symptoms and distress/PTSD symptoms a little, and may also reduce anxiety a little. For indicated prevention in children, the programmes may slightly reduce functional impairment, depressive symptoms and distress/PTSD symptoms. We have limited confidence in many of the studies because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the studies involved different populations and delivery methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew their treatment group, many studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies varied in the types of people involved and how the programmes were delivered.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to November 2021, the date of our most recent search."
