    "output": "Is the antiviral drug favipiravir (a medicine that may stop the virus from copying) effective and safe for treating COVID‑19?\n\nKey messages\n– We do not know whether favipiravir improves survival or reduces the need for a ventilator, and it may cause a few more mild side‑effects; serious side‑effects appear similar to other treatments.\n– Most studies involved adults who were hospitalised with mild‑to‑moderate illness and compared favipiravir mainly with placebo or standard care, but they did not show clear benefit.\n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to decide if favipiravir has a useful role in treating COVID‑19.\n\nWhy is COVID‑19 a global health challenge and what treatments are being explored?\nCOVID‑19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since early 2020 it has spread worldwide, leading to many hospitalisations, long‑term health problems and deaths. The disease can cause severe breathing trouble, putting huge strain on hospitals and health workers. Because there was no cure at first, doctors tried many medicines to see if they could help people recover faster or avoid serious complications. One of these medicines is favipiravir – a drug originally developed for influenza that works by stopping the virus from copying its genetic material. Other treatments that have been studied include different antivirals, steroids, and supportive care such as oxygen, fluids and ventilation.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?\nWe wanted to find out whether favipiravir actually helps people with COVID‑19. We compared favipiravir with no specific antiviral treatment, with usual supportive care, and with other experimental antivirals. The outcomes we looked at were death rates, need for a ventilator, hospital admission, how quickly patients got better (clinical recovery), and any side‑effects (adverse events). We gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a comparison (placebo or standard care) – to keep the results as unbiased as possible.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched for RCTs that compared favipiravir with no treatment, standard care or other antivirals in people with acute COVID‑19. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria and the GRADE approach, which tells us how certain we are about each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 25 RCTs that together enrolled about 5,750 adults with COVID‑19. Most participants were under 60 years old, were in hospital with mild‑to‑moderate disease, and the trials were conducted in many countries. In most trials favipiravir was given as an initial dose of 1,600 mg or 1,800 mg twice on the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to fourteen days. The drug was mainly compared with placebo or standard care (22 trials); two trials compared it with lopinavir/ritonavir and one with umifenovir.\nWe do not know whether favipiravir reduces death or the need for a ventilator. The evidence is very uncertain, so any effect is likely small. For out‑patients, favipiravir may make little or no difference to the chance of later being admitted to hospital. It is also unclear whether favipiravir speeds up clinical recovery or reduces the need for oxygen therapy; any benefit is probably small and the evidence is very uncertain. Favipiravir may increase the chance of experiencing any side‑effect slightly, but serious side‑effects appear similar to other treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident because the studies were small and varied in the types of participants and how the drug was given.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to July 2023."
