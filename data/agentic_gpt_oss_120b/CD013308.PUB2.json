    "output": "Which dose, duration, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is most effective for quitting smoking?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Using a fast‑acting product (such as gum, lozenge, or spray) together with a nicotine patch helps more people quit than using a single product alone. About 10 out of 100 people quit with one product, compared with about 13 out of 100 when both are used.\n- Higher‑dose patches (for example 42 mg/44 mg) may work better than lower‑dose patches, and starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) may also improve quit rates.\n- Side‑effects are generally low, but one study found more people stopped treatment when using a nasal spray instead of a patch. Overall, we still need better research on the safest and most effective dose, duration, and form of NRT.\n\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?\nSmoking causes heart disease, lung cancer, and many other serious illnesses. Helping people stop smoking is therefore a major public‑health goal. When a person stops smoking they experience cravings and withdrawal symptoms because nicotine – the addictive substance in cigarettes – is no longer present. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a group of medicines that give a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful smoke. By easing cravings, NRT makes it easier to move from smoking to staying completely smoke‑free. NRT comes in several forms – patches that stick to the skin, gum, lozenges, sprays, or inhalers – and can be used at different strengths (doses) and for different lengths of time.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about nicotine replacement therapy?\nWe wanted to find out which specific ways of using NRT are most effective and safe for helping people stay quit for at least six months. We compared different forms (fast‑acting products versus a patch), different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers), different durations (how long the treatment lasts), and different schedules, including whether starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) improves success.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for randomised trials that compared one type of NRT use with another. We included studies that measured smoking abstinence at least six months after treatment began and that involved adults motivated to quit. We combined the results to assess long‑term quit rates and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 randomised trials involving 43,327 motivated adult smokers from many countries. All trials measured quitting at least six months after the start of treatment.\n- Combination therapy (a fast‑acting product plus a patch) increased quit rates compared with a single product. Roughly 13 out of 100 people quit with the combination, versus 10 out of 100 with a single product.\n- Higher‑dose patches (42 mg/44 mg) appeared more effective than lower‑dose patches (21 mg/22 mg), and 21 mg patches were more effective than 14 mg patches.\n- Starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) showed a moderate benefit, with about 12 out of 100 people quitting versus 10 out of 100 when starting on the quit day.\n- Using a fast‑acting product alone gave similar quit rates to using a patch alone.\n- We did not find clear differences in quit rates based on how long people used patches or combination therapy, or which fast‑acting product they used (gum, lozenge, spray, etc.).\n- Side‑effects were generally low. One study reported more people stopped treatment when using a nasal spray compared with a patch.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these findings because many studies were small and participants often knew which treatment they received, which could influence results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to April 2022."
