    "output": "Is tube feeding (enteral nutrition) better than IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition) or regular eating after Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy) for adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Feeding through a tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunal tube) probably shortens hospital stay by 1–2 days compared with IV nutrition, and it does not clearly change the risk of common complications such as pancreatic leaks (post‑operative pancreatic fistula), slow stomach emptying (delayed gastric emptying), or bleeding (post‑pancreatectomy haemorrhage).\n- Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the small intestine (naso‑jejunal tube) shows little or no difference in hospital stay or complications when compared with IV nutrition. Likewise, jejunal tube feeding shows little or no difference when compared with normal oral eating.\n- Our confidence in these findings is low because the studies were small, used different feeding protocols, and often lacked details about serious complications. No difference in death rates was observed.\n\nWhat health problems can occur after a Whipple operation?\nA pancreaticoduodenectomy, also called a Whipple procedure, removes the head of the pancreas to treat cancer, benign tumours, or chronic pancreatitis. The operation offers the best chance of long‑term survival but dramatically changes the digestive system. Many patients become malnourished after surgery because the operation is extensive and complications are common. Maintaining good nutrition is therefore a major challenge. Patients can receive nutrition in three ways:\n- Oral feeding – drinking fluids that are gradually advanced to solid foods, sometimes as much as the patient wants (ad libitum).\n- Enteral feeding – delivering food directly into the small intestine through a tube placed either through the nose into the jejunum (naso‑jejunal tube) or surgically attached to the jejunum (jejunal tube).\n- IV nutrition – providing all or part of the nutritional needs through an intravenous line, either a central line (total parenteral nutrition) or a peripheral line (supplemental parenteral nutrition).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare these postoperative nutrition strategies after Whipple surgery. Specifically, we examined how oral feeding, jejunal tube feeding, naso‑jejunal tube feeding, and IV nutrition each affect length of hospital stay, the occurrence of pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, and overall mortality.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL) and trial registers from their start dates to October 2022. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Where possible we combined results and used the GRADE system to judge how certain the evidence is.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 17 randomised trials that enrolled 1,897 adults who had undergone a Whipple operation. The trials compared:\n- Enteral feeding through a jejunal tube, a naso‑jejunal tube, or a gastro‑jejunostomy.\n- IV nutrition (total or supplemental).\n- Unrestricted oral intake.\nFour trials compared jejunal tube feeding with total IV nutrition. We found that jejunal feeding probably shortens hospital stay by 1–2 days. It does not clearly change the risk of pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding.\nTwo trials compared naso‑jejunal feeding with total IV nutrition. The evidence shows little or no difference in hospital stay, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding. There may be a small increase in pancreatic fistula with IV nutrition, but confidence is low.\nTwo trials compared jejunal tube feeding with unrestricted oral intake. The evidence shows little or no difference in hospital stay or complications, and certainty is very low.\nNo trial found a difference in death rates between any feeding method.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in these findings because the studies involved small numbers of participants, used different feeding protocols, and often omitted details about follow‑up, funding, study locations, and participants’ ages or genders. The small sample sizes mean we cannot be sure about rare but serious complications.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to the October 2022 search date. New trials may have been published since then."
