    "output": "Is receiving hospital‑level care at home (hospital‑at‑home that avoids admission) as safe and less costly as staying in the hospital for older adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Hospital‑at‑home for older adults is about as safe as a regular hospital stay; death rates and readmission rates are similar, and it probably halves the chance of moving into a care home. The evidence for these outcomes is of moderate certainty.\n- People cared for at home may be more satisfied, report similar overall health, have shorter initial hospital stays, and the approach probably lowers health‑service costs. Evidence for satisfaction and for the reduction in length of stay is of low certainty, while evidence for health status and costs is moderate.\n- Future research should examine longer‑term effects, the impact on caregivers, and high‑quality cost analyses.\n\nWhat is admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home and why is it needed?\nWhen a person becomes seriously ill, the usual response is to admit them to a hospital for short‑term (acute) care. Hospital stays can be expensive, stressful, and may increase the chance that older adults later move into residential care. Admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home is a service where doctors, nurses and other health professionals provide the same active treatment they would give in a hospital, but they do it in the patient’s own home for a limited period. The goal is to treat conditions that would otherwise need a hospital bed – such as flare‑ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, a lung condition that makes breathing difficult), recovery after a stroke, or other acute medical problems – while keeping patients in a familiar environment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to see whether admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home works as well as, or better than, traditional inpatient hospital care. Specifically, we compared the two approaches for survival, the need for later hospital readmission, patient‑reported wellbeing and satisfaction, the likelihood of ending up in residential care, length of stay, and overall cost to the health service and society.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases up to February 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and used the GRADE system (which rates how confident we are in the evidence, from low to high) to assess our confidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 20 trials with a total of 3,100 participants aged 18 years and older.\n- The chance of dying within six months was almost the same in both groups. We measured the difference using a risk ratio (RR), which compares the chance of an event in the hospital‑at‑home group with the chance in the hospital group. An RR of 1 means the same risk; an RR below 1 means lower risk. The RR was 0.88, suggesting a 12 % lower risk with hospital‑at‑home, but this difference could be due to chance. The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Readmission to hospital within three to twelve months was similar. The RR was 1.14, indicating a slight increase that was not statistically important. The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- The chance of living in residential care at six months was probably reduced by about half. The RR was 0.53. The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Patients’ self‑reported health status showed little or no difference. The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Satisfaction with care may be higher with hospital‑at‑home. The evidence for this outcome is of low certainty.\n- The initial average hospital length of stay was probably shorter for the home group. The evidence for this outcome is of low certainty.\n- Health‑service costs were probably lower for hospital‑at‑home. The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are fairly confident in most findings, but some uncertainty remains because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all studies provided all needed data, the studies involved different types of people and varied ways of delivering the intervention, and many trials were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to February 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
