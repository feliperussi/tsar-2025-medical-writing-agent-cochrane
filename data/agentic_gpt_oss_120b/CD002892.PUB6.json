    "output": "Do personal stress‑reduction programs (such as mindfulness or relaxation training) help lower work‑related stress in healthcare workers compared with no treatment?\n\nKey messages\n– Personal stress‑reduction programmes – for example, mindfulness (training that helps you notice thoughts and feelings) or relaxation (activities that help you unwind) – appear to lower work‑related stress in healthcare workers. The studies did not report any unwanted or harmful effects.\n– The programmes may keep stress lower for several months after they end, but we are not very sure about the size of the benefit because many studies were small and had design problems.\n– Better, larger trials that follow participants for longer are needed to confirm how long the benefit lasts and to detect any possible side effects.\n\nWhy is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nPeople who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face high demands, tight schedules and limited support from colleagues or managers. When job pressure exceeds a worker’s skills or the help they receive, they can develop work‑related stress. This stress can turn into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective), cause physical complaints such as headaches or stomach problems, and reduce the quality of care patients receive. Because health‑care workers keep services running, high stress levels affect both staff wellbeing and the health system.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes that target the individual health‑care worker – such as training to notice and manage stress, relaxation or exercise activities, changes to personal work habits, or a mix of these approaches – actually reduce stress symptoms. We compared these individual‑level interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. We looked at short‑term effects (up to 3 months after the programme ended), medium‑term effects (more than 3 months up to a year), and long‑term effects (over a year).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies that randomly assigned health‑care workers to either a stress‑reduction programme or to no programme (or another programme). We combined the results and judged our confidence in the evidence based on how well the studies were done, how many participants they had, and how consistent the findings were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 117 randomised controlled trials that together involved 11,119 health‑care workers. All trials tested individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes, which fell into four groups:\n1. Programmes that help people pay attention to their experience of stress.\n2. Programmes that help people divert attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise).\n3. Programmes that try to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level.\n4. Programmes that combine two or more of the above.\nMost studies compared these programmes with doing nothing, a waiting‑list control, a placebo, or another stress‑reduction programme.\nThe evidence is of low certainty, but it suggests the programmes can lead to small reductions in stress symptoms in the short term (up to three months) and the medium term (more than three months up to twelve months). For example, programmes that focus on the experience of stress lowered burnout scores by about five points, programmes that divert attention away from stress lowered scores by about seven points, and combined programmes lowered scores by about eight points. Evidence about programmes that target work‑related, individual‑level factors is very uncertain, and we have no reliable evidence about long‑term effects (beyond twelve months).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they were receiving, many studies were very small, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2022."
