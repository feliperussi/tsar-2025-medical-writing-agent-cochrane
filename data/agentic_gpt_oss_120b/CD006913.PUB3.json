    "output": "Do psychological therapies (talk therapy, education, relaxation) improve quality of life, depression, anxiety, or disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Talk therapy, education, and relaxation probably give small improvements in quality of life, depression, and anxiety for adults with IBD; talk therapy may also improve quality of life for children and adolescents.\n– The studies did not show a clear effect on disease activity, and no harmful effects were reported.\n– We have moderate confidence in the evidence, but the trials were short, varied a lot, and many were small. We need longer, well‑designed studies that also look at disease activity and include children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation and damage to the digestive tract. People with IBD often have painful gut symptoms, frequent bowel movements, and sometimes serious complications that affect daily life. Many also develop anxiety and depression. The relationship works both ways: stress from living with a chronic gut condition can worsen mental health, and poor mental health can make gut symptoms feel worse. Standard medical care reduces gut inflammation but does not directly address emotional wellbeing.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions – talk therapy (psychotherapy), patient education, or relaxation techniques – can improve three outcomes for people with IBD: (1) quality of life (how well a person feels they are living day‑to‑day), (2) emotional state (levels of depression and anxiety), and (3) disease activity (how active the gut inflammation is). We examined studies that compared these approaches with usual care or other treatments, in both adults and children.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched major databases and trial registers up to May 2023 for randomised trials that tested any psychological intervention in IBD and reported at least two months of follow‑up. Two reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess risk of bias. We pooled results using standard statistical methods and graded the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 trials that enrolled 6,405 participants (6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All trials lasted at least two months.\n\nIn adults:\n– Talk therapy probably improves quality of life and probably reduces depression and anxiety, although the benefits are modest.\n– Education programmes probably improve quality of life and may slightly lower depression and anxiety; they do not change disease activity.\n– Relaxation techniques probably improve quality of life and probably lower depression and anxiety a little; they also do not affect disease activity.\n\nIn children and adolescents:\n– Talk therapy probably improves quality of life; we have no clear data on its effect on anxiety, depression, or disease activity.\n– Evidence for education and relaxation is uncertain because only a few small studies are available.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence because many trials could not blind participants, used different types of interventions, and were small. Not all outcomes were reported in every study, and follow‑up periods were short.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched up to May 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published until then."
