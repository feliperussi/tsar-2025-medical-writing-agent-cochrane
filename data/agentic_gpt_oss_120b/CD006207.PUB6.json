    "output": "Do physical interventions (like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping distance) reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nKey messages:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably does not change your chance of getting flu‑like illness.\n- Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection by about 14 % (roughly five fewer people out of 100 become ill), but we rarely measured harms such as discomfort or skin irritation.\n- Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 masks that filter at least 95 % of tiny particles) do not clearly outperform standard surgical masks in health‑care settings, and both can cause discomfort.\n\nWhy are outbreaks of respiratory viruses a concern and what can we do?\nViruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) affect the nose, throat and lungs. Examples include flu, SARS and COVID‑19. They spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation, and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they may not be sufficient when a new virus appears. Because of this, we study \"physical interventions\" – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include wearing masks, keeping distance, cleaning hands, isolating sick people, and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared physical measures with no intervention or with another measure. We combined the results and judged our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 78 RCTs, including 11 new ones that added 610,872 participants. The trials were conducted in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings across high‑ and low‑income countries. The interventions tested were:\n- Medical or surgical masks versus no mask.\n- N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks.\n- Hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention.\nWe found no trials of gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening.\nOur main findings were:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness.\n- Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of a laboratory‑confirmed flu infection.\n- Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection by about 14 % – roughly five fewer people out of every 100 become ill.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results, but several issues limit them. Many participants knew which intervention they received, which could influence behaviour. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the studies varied in the people studied and how the interventions were delivered. The evidence does not cover all groups, interventions, comparators or outcomes, and many trials were small or had few events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2022."
