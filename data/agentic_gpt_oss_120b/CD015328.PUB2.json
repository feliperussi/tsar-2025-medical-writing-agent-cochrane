    "output": "Do diet changes, exercise programs, or both help prevent excess weight (obesity) in children aged 5‑11?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Changing diet alone is unlikely to lower a child’s body‑mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) or its age‑ and sex‑adjusted version (zBMI) in the short, medium, or long term.\n- Programs that increase physical activity may produce a small reduction in BMI and zBMI and zBMI over the short and medium term.\n- Combining diet and activity can give a modest short‑ and medium‑term benefit, but none of the approaches showed clear long‑term effects, and the studies did not report serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhy is preventing childhood obesity important?\nChildhood obesity means a child’s weight is higher than is healthy for their height. It is rising worldwide and can harm health now and later. Excess weight raises the risk of type‑2 diabetes, heart disease, and mental‑health problems. Stopping obesity early is therefore a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes that change children’s eating habits, increase their physical activity, or combine both can lower BMI or zBMI, and whether these programmes cause any serious adverse events (serious side‑effects such as injuries or severe allergic reactions).\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane database up to February 2023 for randomised controlled trials that included children aged 5‑11 years. We compared diet‑only, activity‑only, and combined diet‑and‑activity programmes with usual care or no intervention. We extracted data on BMI, zBMI, and serious adverse events and assessed the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 172 trials involving about 190,000 children, mostly from high‑income countries and delivered in schools. The interventions fell into three groups:\n- Diet‑only programmes – we found little or no effect on BMI or zBMI at any follow‑up time.\n- Activity‑only programmes – we found little or no effect on BMI in the short and long term, but a slight reduction in the medium term.\n- Combined diet‑and‑activity programmes – we found a modest reduction in BMI and zBMI in the short and medium term, and little or no effect in the long term.\nEvidence on serious adverse events was very uncertain, so we cannot say whether any harms occurred.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies varied a lot in participants, settings, and how the programmes were delivered. Most were small and short‑term, and none focused on children with disabilities or on health‑inequity outcomes. Because of this variability, we have low confidence in the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched for evidence up to February 2023, so the findings reflect studies published or indexed up to that date."
