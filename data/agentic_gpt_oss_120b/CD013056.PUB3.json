    "output": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than germ‑killing ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Antibiotic ear drops (quinolones) probably stop ear discharge better than boric‑acid germ‑killing drops within two weeks – about 30 out of 100 people become dry compared with about 15 out of 100.\n- Evidence for other germ‑killing drops such as acetic‑acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not show clear differences in ear pain, hearing or serious side‑effects.\n- The trials were small and of low quality, so larger, longer‑term studies are needed.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually happens when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum, allowing fluid to leak out – this fluid is called ear discharge (otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, affect daily activities, and, if untreated, lead to more serious ear problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotic ear drops versus germ‑killing ear drops for people with CSOM. Specifically, we asked which treatment is more likely to stop the ear leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or inner‑ear damage.\n\nHow did we look for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared topical antibiotics with topical germ‑killing agents in people with CSOM. We included trials that randomly assigned participants to a treatment group and followed them for at least one week.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 trials that together included 2,371 participants with chronic ear infection. We compared quinolone or aminoglycoside ear drops with boric‑acid, acetic‑acid, povidone‑iodine or aluminium‑acetate ear drops. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks, and longer than four weeks.\n\nHow does treatment affect ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help the ear stop draining more often than boric‑acid drops within two weeks – roughly 30 out of 100 people become dry compared with about 15 out of 100. Acetic‑acid drops may give a small increase in the chance of stopping discharge compared with aminoglycoside drops, but the evidence is uncertain. We do not have clear evidence that acetic‑acid drops differ from quinolone drops, and we cannot tell whether they affect ear pain. Compared with povidone‑iodine drops, quinolone drops probably make little or no difference to ear discharge.\n\nWhat about other outcomes?\nVery few trials reported ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects. Where pain or irritation was measured, the results did not show obvious differences between antibiotic and germ‑killing drops. No study reported health‑related quality of life or serious complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. The trials did not report many outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life or long‑term hearing changes. Because of these limitations, our confidence in the findings ranges from low to moderate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects research published until then."
