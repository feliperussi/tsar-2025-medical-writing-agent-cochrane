    "output": "Is a natural menstrual cycle, hormone medicines (HT), or ovulation‑triggering drugs the best way to prepare the uterus lining (endometrium) for a frozen embryo transfer (FET)?\n\nKey messages\n- We cannot say which method – natural cycle, HT (estrogen and progesterone medicines), or ovulation‑triggering drugs – gives the highest chance of a live birth, because the studies we found show no clear advantage for any approach and they did not report major safety problems.\n- The evidence comes from a limited number of small trials, many of which omitted important outcomes such as miscarriage or multiple pregnancy, so the findings remain uncertain.\n- We need larger, well‑designed randomised trials that compare these methods directly, report both benefits and harms, and include enough participants to give reliable answers.\n\nWhy is preparing the uterus important for frozen embryo transfer?\nMany couples cannot conceive naturally. We create embryos in the laboratory and then freeze them. Later we transfer the frozen‑thawed embryos (FET) into the woman's uterus. FET can increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lower costs, and is relatively simple. Before an embryo can implant, the uterine lining (endometrium) must be receptive. Doctors can prepare the lining in three main ways:\n- Natural cycle: we let the woman's own ovulation occur without medication.\n- Hormone‑therapy (HT) cycle: we give estrogen and progesterone pills or patches to build the lining artificially.\n- Ovulation‑induction cycle: we use medicines to trigger ovulation and then support the lining with hormones.\nHT can be given with or without a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which temporarily suppresses the woman's own hormone production.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about these preparation methods?\nWe wanted to compare the effectiveness (live‑birth rates) and safety (miscarriage and other harms) of the different cycle regimens. Specifically, we examined natural cycles, HT cycles (with or without GnRHa), ovulation‑induction cycles, and modified natural cycles that use a small hormone trigger – human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) – to induce ovulation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, four electronic sources, and two trial registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors. The latest search was completed on 19 December 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any of the cycle regimens for FET.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 32 randomised trials involving 6,352 sub‑fertile women undergoing FET. The trials compared natural cycles, HT cycles, HT cycles with GnRHa suppression, modified natural cycles using an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles. The reports did not always provide details about trial duration, participants' ages, study locations, or funding sources.\nAcross all comparisons, the evidence shows little or no difference in the chances of live birth, miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, or multiple pregnancy. The certainty of the evidence ranges from low to moderate, and for some outcomes—especially multiple pregnancy—it is very low. No single preparation method appears clearly better or worse for women undergoing frozen‑embryo transfer.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but several issues reduce certainty. In many trials participants and clinicians knew which treatment was being used, which can influence results. Several studies did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and most trials were small, leading to imprecise estimates.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates previous versions and includes studies up to December 2022.\n"
