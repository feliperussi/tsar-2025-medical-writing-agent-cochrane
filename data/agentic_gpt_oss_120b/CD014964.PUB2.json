    "output": "Does using ultrasound (sound imaging) to place spinal or epidural anaesthesia improve success compared with feel‑based landmarks in adults?\n\nKey messages:\n- Using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural anaesthesia usually reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the time needed for the block, and it probably increases the chance of success on the first try.\n- Patient satisfaction and the risk of technical failure appear similar between ultrasound guidance and landmark‑based techniques, but the evidence is limited.\n- Future studies should examine pain during the procedure, rare adverse events, and real‑time ultrasound use to clarify any potential harms and confirm the benefits.\n\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia (injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord) is a common way to numb the lower body for surgery, childbirth, or other procedures. Each extra needle poke can raise the risk of bleeding, infection, or nerve irritation and can make the patient uncomfortable. Clinicians usually locate the injection site by feeling the patient’s back and using visible body landmarks. However, the shape and position of the spinal spaces vary between people, so what feels right may not match the actual anatomy. Reducing needle passes and procedure time can improve safety, lower complications, and increase patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare two ways of guiding the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia: using an ultrasound machine (which provides a real‑time picture of the spine’s structures) versus relying only on feel‑based anatomical landmarks. Specifically, we examined whether ultrasound guidance improves first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts and the time needed, and whether it affects patient satisfaction, pain during the procedure, technical failures, or any adverse events.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults. We combined the results, calculated effect sizes, and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 65 trials involving 6,823 adults from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania, published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the trials (32) focused on obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the rest involved surgical patients. All studies compared pre‑procedural ultrasound (and in four trials real‑time ultrasound) with conventional landmark use.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nUltrasound guidance probably increases the chance of succeeding on the first attempt (moderate‑certainty evidence). It reduces the average number of attempts (high‑certainty evidence) and shortens needling time by about 34 seconds (high‑certainty evidence). The evidence suggests little or no difference in patient satisfaction or technical failure (low‑certainty evidence). We remain very uncertain about any effect on pain during the procedure or on adverse events (very low‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many participants likely knew which technique they received, and most studies were small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in November 2023."
