    "output": "Is sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) better than medicine alone for improving nose and lung health in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disease that affects lungs and sinuses) and nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\n\nKey messages\n- We cannot tell if adding endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation) to medicine improves nasal or lung health in cystic fibrosis with nasal polyps, because the study was small.\n- We also cannot tell whether surgery reduces the need for antibiotics, hospital stays, or lung flare‑ups (worsening of lung disease), and only one brief bleeding event was reported.\n- We need larger, well‑designed studies that follow patients for at least a year to determine whether sinus surgery truly helps the nose and lungs and to identify any risks.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes mucus thick and sticky. The thick mucus blocks the tiny passages in the sinuses (air‑filled spaces behind the nose). This causes chronic rhinosinusitis (long‑lasting sinus inflammation) and nasal polyps (soft, non‑cancerous lumps that cause congestion, runny nose and reduced smell).\n\nWhat treatments are usually used for sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\nDoctors first try medicines such as nasal rinses, steroids or antibiotics to reduce inflammation and infection. If medicines do not work, they may offer endoscopic sinus surgery. This operation uses a thin camera and small tools to open blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps, helping medicines reach the sinuses better.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether adding sinus surgery – alone or together with standard medicines – improves outcomes for people with CF who have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Specifically, we looked at nose symptoms, bacterial colonisation (bacteria living in the sinuses), antibiotic use, lung flare‑ups (worsening of lung disease), and overall lung function compared with medicines alone.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised trials that compared sinus surgery (with or without medicines) to medicines alone in people with CF, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one small randomised trial that met our criteria. The trial enrolled 28 participants aged 19‑28 years with CF, chronic sinus infection and nasal polyps. Half of them received nasal irrigation alone (standard care); the other half received nasal irrigation plus endoscopic sinus surgery (polypectomy with extended sinusotomy). The report gave no details about follow‑up length, intervention duration, country or funding.\nThe evidence from this single study is very uncertain. We cannot tell if adding sinus surgery to standard care improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers antibiotic use, decreases lung flare‑ups, or improves lung function in CF. The surgery appeared safe, and we quickly managed the brief bleeding episode. Overall, we cannot determine whether the surgery makes a difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is weak because only one small study is available, and it does not cover all the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we wanted to assess.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in September 2022."
