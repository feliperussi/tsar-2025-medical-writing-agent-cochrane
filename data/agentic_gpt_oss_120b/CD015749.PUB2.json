    "output": "Are combined drug, nutrition, and exercise treatments effective for managing weight loss and muscle wasting (cachexia) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- The combined programmes (multimodal interventions – treatments that combine medicines, special nutrition, and exercise) did not clearly improve weight, muscle loss, physical function, strength, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.\n- Comparing these programmes with a single treatment or with a different version of the programme also showed no clear benefits.\n- Most evidence comes from a small number of trials, mainly in people with cancer, and the studies were short and had design weaknesses. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow people for longer and include more chronic conditions are needed.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that can develop in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, or chronic lung disease (COPD). It means the body loses weight and muscle even when a person eats enough, leading to fatigue, loss of appetite, and a poorer quality of life. Because loss of muscle and strength makes everyday activities harder and can worsen the underlying illness, finding ways to treat or stop cachexia is an important health challenge.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for cachexia?\nDoctors usually try several separate approaches: medicines that may affect metabolism, special nutrition plans that boost calories and protein, and exercise programmes that preserve muscle. Each approach can help a little, but they often do not fully stop the wasting. Researchers think that combining two or more of these strategies – called a multimodal intervention – might work better because the different parts could support each other.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether multimodal programmes that mix medicines, nutrition, and/or exercise improve outcomes for people with cachexia. Specifically, we looked at whether these combined treatments help people walk farther or lift more weight (physical function and strength), reduce side‑effects, improve body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or relevant lab tests, and whether any harms were linked to the combined approaches.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared multimodal programmes with usual care, a variation of the programme, or a single‑component treatment in adults with cachexia. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We then combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence (certainty of evidence) based on study methods, sample sizes, and other factors.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified nine trials involving 926 adults (average age about 63 years). Six trials enrolled people with cancer; the others involved COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants, and interventions lasted from six weeks to seven months. All trials tested multimodal programmes that included at least two of the following: medication, nutrition support, and exercise.\nWe found that these programmes probably make little or no difference to:\n- how well people can move,\n- their muscle strength,\n- body composition,\n- weight,\n- appetite,\n- fatigue,\n- quality of life,\n- and the chance of side‑effects.\nThe certainty of this conclusion is very low, so we cannot be sure about the true effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe judged all outcomes to have very low‑certainty evidence because we downgraded them once for risk of bias or indirectness and twice for imprecision. Participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and the small size of the trials limits reliability. The evidence does not cover all possible people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched up to July 2024, and that is the date of our most recent search."
