    "output": "Does taking colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammation medicine) help prevent heart attacks, strokes and other heart problems in people who have never had heart disease?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that colchicine (a cheap anti‑inflammatory drug) may lower the chance of dying from any cause, but the evidence is very uncertain; it does not clearly reduce heart attacks (myocardial infarction) or strokes (a sudden loss of brain function due to blocked blood flow), and it may increase the risk of diarrhoea (watery bowel movements).\n- Most of the studies were small, had methodological problems, and many focused on conditions other than heart disease, so the overall quality of the evidence is low and we cannot apply the findings confidently to the general population.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive the medicine or a comparison) that specifically look at heart‑related outcomes and track side effects over longer periods are needed to determine whether colchicine is truly beneficial or harmful for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\nWhy is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) a major health problem?\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) occurs when fatty plaques build up inside arteries. These plaques can narrow the vessels or break open, causing blockages that lead to heart attacks, strokes, or other serious complications. ACVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, affecting millions of people. Current prevention methods include lifestyle changes (healthy diet, exercise), cholesterol‑lowering drugs (statins), and medicines that stop blood clots, but many individuals still develop the disease, highlighting the need for additional, affordable strategies.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about colchicine?\nColchicine is an inexpensive anti‑inflammatory drug traditionally used for gout. We set out to determine whether giving colchicine to adults who have never had a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular event (primary prevention) can reduce the risk of dying, having a heart attack, or having a stroke, and whether it causes any important side‑effects. In other words, we compared colchicine with placebo, other anti‑inflammatory agents, or usual care to see if it is safe and effective for preventing cardiovascular events in the general population.\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Heart Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials that compared colchicine with placebo, other drugs or usual care in adults without prior cardiovascular disease. Two or more reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified fifteen randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,721 participants (1,412 analysed). All participants were adults without pre‑existing cardiovascular disease, representing the general population. Follow‑up periods ranged from 4 weeks to 728 weeks. Every trial tested oral colchicine, compared with placebo, methotrexate or usual care; no study compared colchicine with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. Many trials were originally designed to study liver disease rather than heart outcomes.\n\nWhat are the main results for primary prevention with colchicine?\nColchicine may reduce the chance of dying from any cause, but the evidence is very uncertain. It probably has little or no effect on non‑fatal heart attacks, strokes, cardiovascular death or atrial fibrillation, and we are very uncertain about those outcomes. Colchicine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea, although the certainty of this finding is also low. For other possible harms such as seizures or mental confusion, the evidence suggests little or no difference but remains very uncertain. Overall, the current research provides very uncertain information, so we cannot reliably say whether colchicine helps or harms people without existing cardiovascular events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, and because the studies were very small and had methodological problems.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated the evidence to May 2023."
