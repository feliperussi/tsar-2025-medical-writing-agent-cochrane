    "output": "Do skin‑applied insect repellents (topical repellents) reduce the risk of malaria?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Topical insect repellents applied to the skin may slightly lower the chance of getting malaria, especially for high‑risk groups such as refugees, forest workers, or military personnel, but the evidence is limited and not certain.\n– The products are generally safe; only a few users reported mild skin irritation and no serious side‑effects were observed.\n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed, particularly in settings where other malaria control tools are not used, to confirm whether topical repellents provide reliable personal protection and to understand any wider impact on malaria transmission.\n\nWhat is the problem with malaria and current prevention methods?\nMalaria is a disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people by mosquito bites. The main tools we use to stop malaria are insect‑treated bed nets (long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets, LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), which means spraying the inside walls of homes with insecticide. These tools work well when mosquitoes bite people while they are sleeping indoors. However, they protect less well people who are outdoors at night, work in forests, or live in places where nets and spraying are not available, such as refugee camps or military bases. Because malaria can still be transmitted in these situations, we need additional ways to protect people, and one idea is to use topical repellents – creams, lotions, or sprays applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about topical repellents?\nWe wanted to know whether applying topical repellents, either alone or together with LLINs and IRS, reduces the number of new malaria infections. We looked at both high‑risk groups (refugees, forest goers, soldiers) and the general population living in malaria‑endemic areas. We also examined whether the repellents caused any side‑effects and how certain the evidence was.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched several databases up to 11 January 2023 for randomized and controlled studies that evaluated topical repellents for malaria prevention. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results in a meta‑analysis and used the GRADE framework to judge the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials (reported in thirteen articles) that evaluated topical mosquito‑repellent products. The trials enrolled more than 60 000 participants (61 651 in the meta‑analysis). Some studies included high‑risk groups such as refugees, forest goers, and deployed military personnel; others involved broader community populations. Participants used repellents alone or together with LLINs or IRS, and the comparison groups received no repellent or standard care.\nThe pooled analysis suggests that topical repellents may reduce malaria infection and clinical episodes slightly, but the benefit is small and the evidence is uncertain. For roughly every 100 people who use repellents, a few fewer may become infected. Skin irritation was uncommon, affecting about 0.6 % of users.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the findings because many studies were not blinded, meaning participants knew whether they received repellent. Some trials did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and the overall certainty of the evidence was low.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to the search date of January 2023."
