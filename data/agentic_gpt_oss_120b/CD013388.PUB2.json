    "output": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) improves everyday functioning for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia; participants achieve personal goals and feel more confident.\n- For care partners, CR gives small gains in some quality‑of‑life areas, but short‑term data show a slight rise in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n- The evidence relies mainly on one large, high‑quality trial; more diverse, longer‑term studies are needed to confirm benefits and explore any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually impairs memory, thinking and planning. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage (early to middle stages of memory and thinking problems) many people still live at home, but they may struggle with cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments. These difficulties reduce independence and increase reliance on family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors (drugs that boost brain chemicals) do not fully restore daily abilities, so non‑drug approaches like CR are explored.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether CR – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities and care‑partner wellbeing. We also examined whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared CR with usual care for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and measured outcomes for the person or their care partner. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years; about 59 % had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the programme and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months).\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment – participants were more likely to meet the personal daily goals they set. It also led to a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment. Smaller benefits were seen for confidence (self‑efficacy, confidence in one’s ability), immediate memory recall and auditory selective attention. Small declines were observed in general functional ability, memory and anxiety. No major harms were reported. For care partners, CR slightly improved some quality‑of‑life areas. Short‑term data, however, showed a slight rise in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because participants and therapists usually knew which treatment they received, and only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
