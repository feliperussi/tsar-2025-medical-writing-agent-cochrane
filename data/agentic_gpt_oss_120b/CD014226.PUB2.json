    "output": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) better than open surgery or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulging of the main belly artery)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR)—a minimally invasive graft with openings for the kidney arteries—is better than open surgical repair (OSR) or no surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). This is because we found no eligible randomised trials, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.\n- The lack of studies shows how hard it is to research complex AAAs. These aneurysms are rare and come in many shapes, making it difficult to recruit enough participants for high‑quality trials.\n- Future research should run well‑designed randomised trials that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or conservative management to find any advantages, risks, and long‑term outcomes.\n\nWhat are abdominal aortic aneurysms and why are they a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened area in the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall of the aorta stretches out, it can become thin and may burst, which is often fatal. Most AAAs occur below the kidneys, but some grow close to the kidneys’ blood vessels, making them harder to fix safely.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n- Open surgical repair (OSR) – a traditional operation where the surgeon opens the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube.\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a less invasive technique that uses a thin tube (catheter) inserted through a small cut in the groin. The tube delivers a graft that has tiny windows (fenestrations) so blood can still flow to the kidneys and other important arteries.\n- Conservative (non‑operative) management – careful monitoring without surgery, used when the risks of an operation outweigh the benefits.\nEach option has potential benefits and harms, and we do not know which is best for AAAs near the kidney arteries.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than open surgery or non‑operative care for people with these complex AAAs. We planned to compare death rates, need for further procedures, kidney problems, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or non‑operative care for complex AAAs. Because no eligible studies were found, there were no results to combine or analyse.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible randomised or quasi‑randomised trials, so there were zero included studies and no participants. Because no studies met our criteria, we could not extract information on study length, funding, participant ages or health, where the studies were done, or details of the two treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very low confidence in the evidence because no eligible trials were identified, leaving us unable to assess the benefits or harms of the interventions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to our search in March 2023."
