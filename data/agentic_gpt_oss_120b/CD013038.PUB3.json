    "output": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not speed up the time they reach full sucking feeds, and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The same approach also had little or no effect on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), on the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition, or on the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- We need larger, well‑designed studies to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Because their nervous system is immature, they often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Therefore we usually give them nutrition through an orogastric or nasogastric tube that goes into the stomach. Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay the transition to full oral (sucking) feeds, keep the baby in hospital longer, and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos) up to 26 April 2023. We also looked at clinical trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that enrolled 1,277 preterm infants receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The abstracts omitted details about study duration, location, and funding. Very early‑gestation infants who needed nutritional support took part in the studies.\n\nWhat did the main results show about time to full sucking feeds?\nThe evidence suggests that adding smell and taste to tube feeds probably makes little or no difference to how quickly babies reach full sucking feeds. No clear safety problems were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and they used different groups of infants and different ways of delivering the intervention. Moreover, not all studies reported all the outcomes we needed.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search."
