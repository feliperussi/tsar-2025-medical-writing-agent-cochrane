    "output": "Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a minimally invasive tape placed through the vagina) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Single‑incision slings work about as well as retropubic and transobturator slings at 12 months, based on women’s reports of cure or improvement.\n- Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably reduce long‑term pain and may lower the chance of urinary retention, while showing a similar or slightly lower risk of mesh exposure.\n- Evidence on other harms such as mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery and painful intercourse (dyspareunia) is uncertain, and longer‑term data are needed.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure on the bladder rises – for example during coughing, sneezing, laughing or exercising. The leakage can be embarrassing, limit daily activities and lead to social isolation. It also creates costs for health services and personal care products, making it a common and costly health issue.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether single‑incision sling operations are as effective and safe as other surgical options for stress urinary incontinence, and whether they are cost‑effective. Specifically we compared single‑incision slings with retropubic slings, transobturator slings and autologous fascial slings on:\n1. Women’s reported cure or improvement (subjective cure).\n2. Adverse events such as mesh exposure (the synthetic material becoming visible), painful sex (dyspareunia), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder) and need for repeat surgery.\n3. Cost‑effectiveness evidence.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. We extracted data on effectiveness, safety and costs and rated the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found in 62 trials that together enrolled 8 051 women.\n- Single‑incision vs retropubic slings (10 trials, ~300 women): cure or improvement at 12 months was similar (risk ratio 0.99). Evidence on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery and quality of life was uncertain.\n- Single‑incision vs transobturator slings (51 trials, ~2 360 women): cure or improvement at 12 months was the same (risk ratio 1.00, high certainty). Pain reported at 24 months was probably much lower with single‑incision slings (risk ratio 0.12, moderate certainty). Mesh exposure was slightly lower (risk ratio 0.61, high certainty). Urinary retention was probably reduced (risk ratio 0.68, moderate certainty). Quality of life may be slightly lower and repeat surgery may be slightly higher, but the evidence is low certainty.\n- Single‑incision vs autologous fascial slings (1 trial, 70 women): we could not determine any differences because data were missing.\nTwo economic evaluations and one cost‑minimisation analysis were included, but the review did not find conclusive evidence on cost‑effectiveness.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe searches were current to September 2022. No newer trials were included.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in many findings because most trials were small, some participants knew which surgery they received, and not all outcomes were reported consistently. Follow‑up was usually only 12 months, so long‑term safety remains unclear.\n\nWhat does this mean for women?\nCurrent evidence suggests that single‑incision slings are likely as effective as other sling types at one year and may cause less long‑term pain. However, we still do not know how they compare on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery or painful intercourse over several years. Women should discuss these uncertainties with their clinicians and consider that longer‑term data are still needed."
