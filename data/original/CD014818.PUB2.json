  "abstract": "Rationale\nPostoperative pain is an important outcome for individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery. Regional analgesia techniques are considered integral to postoperative pain management, but are not without risks.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the analgesic benefits and harms of different regional analgesia techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 6 June 2023 without restrictions on language, publication year, or publication status.\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two or three of the following regional analgesia techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery: paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).\n\nOutcomes\nOur critical outcomes were postoperative pain (rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS) or numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0–10) and rates of regional analgesia‐related complications.\nOur important outcomes were quality of recovery, time to first analgesic request, postoperative opioid and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).\n\nRisk of bias\nWe used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) to assess risk of bias.\n\nSynthesis methods\nWe conducted network meta‐analyses (NMAs) using multivariate frequentist random‐effects models to calculate mean differences (MDs), standardised mean differences (SMDs), or risk ratios (RRs), each with its 95% confidence interval (CI). We used CINeMA to rate the certainty of evidence. We only included studies with an overall low risk of bias in the primary analysis. For postoperative pain, we considered one point difference as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).\n\nIncluded studies\nWe included 39 RCTs with a total of 2348 participants. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023 in Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, USA, and Thailand. Most used single‐shot long‐acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance. In 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy. All studies performed surgery under general anaesthesia in the hospital. Our primary analysis for postoperative pain included 16 studies.\n\nSynthesis of results\nCritical outcomes\nPostoperative pain at rest at two hours\nThis NMA included seven studies (384 participants). PEC is slightly more effective than PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at two hours (MD −0.47, 95% CI −0.73 to −0.22; P < 0.001, I2= 0%; high‐certainty evidence), but this difference is smaller than the MCID. Compared with PVB, ESPB is similarly effective (MD −0.12, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.07; P = 0.21, I2= 0%; high‐certainty evidence), and SAPB probably has similar effectiveness (MD −0.50, 95% CI −1.09 to 0.09; P = 0.094, I2= 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence).\nPostoperative pain during movement at two hours\nThis NMA included four studies (246 participants). PEC may be more effective than PVB in reducing postoperative pain during movement at two hours (MD −1.06, 95% CI −1.98 to −0.14; P = 0.024, I2= 79.6%; low‐certainty evidence). ESPB compared with PVB may be similarly effective (MD −0.46, 95% CI −1.24 to 0.33; P = 0.25, I2= 79.6%; low‐certainty evidence).\nPostoperative pain at rest at 24 hours\nThis NMA included 13 studies (793 participants). PEC is slightly more effective than PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at 24 hours (MD −0.32, 95% CI −0.61 to −0.03; P = 0.029, I2= 38.7%; high‐certainty evidence), but the difference is smaller than the MCID. Compared with PVB, ESPB is similarly effective (MD −0.15, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.05; P = 0.14, I2= 38.7%; high‐certainty evidence), and SAPB is similarly effective (MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.42 to 0.10; P = 0.23, I2= 38.7%; high‐certainty evidence).\nPostoperative pain during movement at 24 hours\nThis NMA included eight studies (545 participants). Compared with PVB, ESPB probably has similar effectiveness for reducing postoperative pain during movement at 24 hours (MD −0.09, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.31; P = 0.67, I2= 74.1%; moderate‐certainty evidence), PEC may be similarly effective (MD 0.08, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.64; P = 0.78, I2= 74.1%; low‐certainty evidence), and SAPB may be similarly effective (MD 0.16, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.69; P = 0.57, I2= 74.1%; very low‐certainty evidence), although the evidence from the last analysis is very uncertain.\nPostoperative pain at rest at 48 hours\nOne study (44 participants) reported postoperative pain at rest at 48 hours and found little or no difference in effectiveness between PVB and ESPB, though the evidence is very uncertain (MD 0.18, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.67; P = 0.47; very low‐certainty evidence).\nPostoperative pain during movement at 48 hours\nThis NMA included two studies (104 participants). Compared with PVB, ESPB may be similarly effective for reducing postoperative pain during movement at 48 hours (MD 0.13, 95% CI −0.55 to 0.81; P = 0.71, I2= 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and PEC may be similarly effective (MD −0.07, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.29; P = 0.71, I2= 0%; very low‐certainty evidence), although the evidence from both analyses is very uncertain.\nComplications\nThree studies (170 participants) recorded complications, but there were no reported events of block failure, local anaesthetic systemic toxicity, hypotension, nerve damage, intraneural injection, accidental vascular puncture, bleeding at puncture site, infection, or pneumothorax.\nCertainty of evidence\nWe frequently downgraded the certainty of the evidence for imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide CIs, particularly for complications and analgesic use. Heterogeneity also affected certain pain outcomes. Limited data availability further reduced certainty, with outcomes based on one or two studies rated as very low.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nOverall, the regional analgesia techniques included in our NMAs seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.\n\nRegistration\nProtocol (2022): doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014818",
  "pls": "Are there differences in benefits and harms among regional pain management techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\nOverall, we found that different pain blocks were similar for managing pain after breast cancer surgery.\nComplication rates were low among all pain block techniques.\nWhat is regional analgesia, and how does it work?\n\nRegional analgesia is a pain block technique used in breast cancer surgery. It involves injecting pain‐numbing medicine near specific nerves in the breast area to block pain signals during and after surgery. Unlike opioids, which affect the whole body, regional analgesia targets only the nerves. Different regional analgesia techniques target different nerves, as shown below.\nParavertebral block: near the spine\nErector spinae plane block: along the back muscles\nPectoral nerve block: in the chest area\nSerratus anterior plane block: near the sides of the chest\nWhy is this important for women undergoing breast cancer surgery?\n\nPain after breast surgery can cause problems, lead to longer hospital stays, and even result in long‐term pain. Opioids, commonly used for pain relief, have side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Regional analgesia is important because it effectively reduces pain while avoiding the risks associated with opioids.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nThis review looked at how well regional analgesia techniques work and how safe they are. We compared different types of nerve blocks to see their effects on pain levels and possible complications.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for high‐quality medical studies that compared different types of nerve blocks for breast cancer surgery. We analysed their combined effects on pain and complications using advanced statistical methods. We evaluated erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block against paravertebral block.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 39 studies involving 2348 women. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023. The results of the most important outcomes are summarised below.\nFor reducing pain at rest two hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block is slightly more effective than paravertebral block, but this difference is not clinically meaningful. Compared with paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block is similarly effective, and serratus anterior plane block probably has similar effectiveness.\nFor reducing pain during movement two hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block may be more effective than paravertebral block. Erector spinae plane block and paravertebral block may be similarly effective.\nFor reducing pain at rest 24 hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block is slightly more effective than paravertebral block, but this difference is not clinically meaningful. Compared with paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block and serratus anterior plane block are similarly effective.\nFor reducing pain during movement 24 hours after surgery, compared with paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block probably has similar effectiveness, pectoral nerve block may be similarly effective, and serratus anterior plane block may be similarly effective, but the last result is very uncertain.\nFor reducing pain at rest 48 hours after surgery, one study reported no difference between paravertebral block and erector spinae plane block, but the result is very uncertain.\nFor reducing pain during movement 48 hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block and erector spinae plane block may be similarly effective compared with paravertebral block, but both results are very uncertain.\nIn the three studies that recorded complications of regional analgesia, no complications occurred.\nOverall, we found that the different regional analgesia techniques were similarly effective for managing pain management, and that all had low complication rates.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nSome factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. First, some comparisons included few studies and participants, making the results less reliable. Second, studies sometimes had different findings, making it harder to draw clear conclusions. Third, we excluded some studies from our analysis because we considered their methods were not sufficiently robust. Finally, where studies did not provide results, we had to calculate them ourselves, which may have added some uncertainty.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe review is current to 6 June 2023.",
