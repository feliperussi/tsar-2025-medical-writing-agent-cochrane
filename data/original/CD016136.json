  "abstract": "Rationale\nIntravenous iron is increasingly used to treat iron‐deficient anaemia (IDA) in pregnancy. A previous network meta‐analysis suggested that intravenous irons have a greater effect on haematological parameters than oral irons; however, the impact on serious pregnancy complications such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) or the need for blood transfusion was unclear. Since then, several new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted.\n\nObjectives\nTo evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous versus oral iron preparations for treating IDA in pregnancy.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP) for eligible studies. The latest search was performed on 19 March 2024.\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included RCTs in pregnant women with confirmed IDA (haemoglobin (Hb) level < 11 g/dL as per World Health Organization (WHO) criteria) comparing intravenous (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, ferumoxytol) and oral (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate) iron preparations.\n\nOutcomes\nOur outcomes were antenatal and postnatal Hb levels, antenatal and postnatal anaemia status, PPH, blood transfusion, maternal satisfaction, maternal well‐being, breastfeeding, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, and adverse events (AEs).\n\nRisk of bias\nWe used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias in the included RCTs.\n\nSynthesis methods\nWe followed standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and scientific rigour, evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a fixed‐effect model in the first instance. We reported dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nIncluded studies\nWe included 13 RCTs (3939 participants) mainly conducted in India and Africa (8/13). Gestational age at baseline ranged from 13 to 37 weeks, and Hb levels ranged from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most frequently compared preparations were intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate (5/13). Most RCTs were at low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, mainly due to concerns over attrition bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.\n\nSynthesis of results\nAntenatal outcomes\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb level three to six weeks after treatment start (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.69; 11 RCTs; 2935 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence) and likely reduces anaemia status three to six weeks after treatment start (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; 5 RCTs; 2189 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence).\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb level around birth (MD 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.77; 6 RCTs; 1574 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence) and likely reduces anaemia status around birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93; 4 RCTs; 1240 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence).\nPostpartum outcomes\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron may slightly increase Hb level postpartum (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68; 3 RCTs; 1950 participants;low‐certainty evidence). It may also reduce anaemia status (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.73; 3 RCTs; 1950 participants;low‐certainty evidence) and severe anaemia postpartum (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.84; 2 RCTs; 1581 participants;very low‐certainty evidence), although the evidence for the latter outcome is very uncertain.\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.20; 3 RCTs; 2251 participants;low‐certainty evidence) and likely results in little to no difference in the need for blood transfusion (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.60; 6 RCTs; 2592 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence) or rates of breastfeeding (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 1 RCT; 404 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence).\nNo trials reported on maternal satisfaction or maternal well‐being.\nAdverse outcomes\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron may have little to no effect on maternal mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.13 to 6.39; 4 RCTs; 2152 participants;very low‐certainty evidence).\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely does not increase maternal morbidity: severe infections (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.18; 1 RCT; 1881 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence) and prolonged hospital stay (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21; 1 RCT; 1764 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence) and may not increase admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.87; 2 RCTs; 2069 participants;low‐certainty evidence).\nCompared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely does not increase AEs (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.35; 1 RCT; 349 participants;moderate‐certainty evidence) and may not increase serious AEs (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; 1 RCT; 1934 participants;low‐certainty evidence). However, individual AEs were inconsistently reported across trials.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nIntravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb levels and likely reduces anaemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hb levels postpartum may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on postpartum severe anaemia status is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH, and blood transfusion rates are likely unaffected by route of administration.\nSynthesis of adverse outcomes proved challenging due to their rarity and suboptimal reporting. The effects of intravenous iron on maternal mortality and admissions to the ICU are very uncertain, and there is likely little to no difference between groups in severe infections and prolonged hospital stay. Intravenous iron likely does not increase AEs and may not increase serious AEs; however, the 95% CIs in both cases include potential harm. Furthermore, this finding should be treated cautiously due to the varied adverse event profiles of both types of iron preparations.\nData from the ongoing multicentre trials may address some of the identified evidence gaps. However, there is a clear need to strengthen the co‐ordination of research efforts around clinically important time points of outcome measure, homogeneity of their definition, and safety reporting.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding.\n\nRegistration\nRegistration (2024): PROSPERO, CRD42024523791 via www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024523791",
  "pls": "What are the benefits and risks of intravenous versus oral iron for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\n\nKey messages\nIntravenous iron is likely better at treating anaemia caused by a lack of iron during pregnancy than oral iron.\nIntravenous iron may result in little to no difference in heavy bleeding after childbirth and likely results in little to no difference in need for blood transfusion compared to oral iron.\nSerious unwanted effects were rare and may not be increased with intravenous iron compared to oral iron.\nWhat is iron deficiency anaemia?\n\nIron deficiency anaemia is a condition that affects how well the blood can carry oxygen throughout the body. It is caused by insufficient levels of iron in the blood. When there is not enough iron in the blood, the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin, the molecule needed for oxygen to be carried to every living cell. People with iron deficiency anaemia can experience fatigue, weakness, headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath.\nHow do iron therapies treat iron deficiency anaemia?\n\nIron therapies help increase the amount of available iron in the blood and can, therefore, increase haemoglobin levels, provided there are no other causes of anaemia. Two main forms of iron therapy are intravenous (injected into a vein) and oral (by mouth). Within these two groups are multiple preparations and many forms of iron therapies that can be used to treat iron deficiency anaemia.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if intravenous iron is better than oral iron at treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy and to explore any unwanted effects caused by the different routes of administration.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for all available studies looking at the effects of intravenous iron compared to oral iron in pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 13 studies involving a total of 3939 pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia. Most studies looked at women's anaemia status between three and six weeks after they had received intravenous or oral iron. The 13 studies were published over 20 years, between 2002 and 2024.\nWe found that intravenous iron is likely better at treating iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy than oral iron. Intravenous iron given during pregnancy may slightly reduce severe anaemia after birth compared to oral iron, but we are very uncertain about the results. There did not seem to be a difference between intravenous and oral iron in the ability to prevent heavy bleeding after childbirth or the need for blood transfusion. Serious unwanted effects, including death, were rare and may not be increased with intravenous iron compared to oral iron.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident that intravenous iron improves haemoglobin levels and anaemia during pregnancy compared to oral iron. However, we have moderate to very low confidence in the evidence for unwanted effects of treatment because this information was reported differently across studies. Also, serious unwanted effects were rare, making it difficult to confidently say whether intravenous iron has more risks than oral iron.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to March 2024.",
