  "abstract": "Rationale\nNeuraxial anaesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully, because the targeting space imagined by palpation of anatomical position can deviate from the actual position. Successful neuraxial anaesthesia, with as few punctures as possible, is important to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction. Neuraxial anaesthesia by ultrasound guidance may be a useful way to increase success rates.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the clinical efficacy and safety of ultrasound guidance compared with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and two trials registries, together with reference checking and citation searching, to identify studies that are included in the review. After the original search on 11 October 2022, we updated the electronic searches on 28 November 2023.\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ultrasound guidance with the use of conventional anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults (≥ 18 years). We excluded studies on non‐anaesthetic neuraxial procedures, such as lumbar puncture for diagnosis.\n\nOutcomes\nOur critical outcomes were: (1) number of attempts until success or procedure termination; (2) procedure time; and (3) participant satisfaction during the procedure. Our important outcomes were: (1) first‐attempt success; (2) technical failure; (3) pain during the procedure; and (4) any adverse events.\n\nRisk of bias\nWe used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies for the seven critical and important outcomes.\n\nSynthesis methods\nWe synthesised results for each outcome, where possible, by using a random‐effects analytical model. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, each with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where meta‐analysis was not possible due to the nature of the data, we summarised the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\nIncluded studies\nWe included a total of 65 studies with 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. Thirty‐two studies evaluated obstetric populations undergoing labour epidural or caesarean section (3149 participants); the remaining studies evaluated participants who received surgery under neuraxial anaesthesia. Thirty‐three studies evaluated spinal anaesthesia, 15 studies evaluated lumbar epidural anaesthesia, 12 studies evaluated combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia, and the remaining four studies evaluated thoracic epidural anaesthesia. Four studies evaluated real‐time ultrasound as an intervention arm. Two studies were three‐arm trials, which evaluated pre‐procedural ultrasound and real‐time ultrasound. For participant satisfaction, a variety of measurement scales were used, so we synthesised participant satisfaction using SMD.\n\nSynthesis of results\nOur meta‐analyses demonstrated that compared with anatomical landmarks, ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts until success or procedure termination (MD ‐0.41 attempts, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.31; 57 studies, 6192 participants; high‐certainty evidence), and procedure (needling) time (MD ‐33.8 seconds, 95% CI ‐47.22 to ‐20.39; 43 studies, 4178 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ultrasound guidance likely increases the rate of first‐attempt success (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.52; 50 studies, 5205 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in participant satisfaction (SMD 0.16, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.35; 25 studies; low‐certainty evidence), or in technical failure (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; 40 studies, 4581 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure (MD ‐0.20 points, 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.13; 13 studies, 1532 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and adverse effects (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.03; 15 studies, 1692 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nCompared to anatomical landmarks, ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure (needling) time. It likely increases the rate of first‐attempt success. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events. Although ultrasound guidance can be beneficial for neuraxial anaesthesia without increased risk, these results should be interpreted with caution due to some uncertainties in the evidence.\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\nRegistration\nProtocol available via doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014964.",
  "pls": "Is it better to use ultrasound or anatomical landmarks to guide the needle to the correct placement for anaesthesia around the spinal cord in adults?\n\nKey messages\nCompared to anatomical landmarks, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults reduces the number of attempts until success, and the procedure (needling) time. Success is defined as either the number of times the needle is advanced following a backward movement, or the number of times it punctures the skin.\nUltrasound guidance likely increases the rate of success on the first try.\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to participant satisfaction or technical failure. Technical failure might include the need to change to general anaesthesia, or the need to discontinue the procedure for neuraxial anaesthesia, or whether the person experienced the intended anaesthetic effect.\nWe do not know whether ultrasound guidance affects pain during the procedures and adverse events.\nUltrasound guidance in neuraxial anaesthesia probably has some benefits, but uncertainties remain.\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?Neuraxial anaesthesia is performed by injecting a local anaesthetic into the spaces surrounding the spinal cord, usually the spinal or epidural space, or a combination. It is a common technique for numbing a specific area of the body, used mainly for surgery or during labour. In neuraxial anaesthesia, the doctor places a needle between the vertebrae (backbones). Once the doctor finds the right spot, he or she will either inject the anaesthetic directly, or place a thin tube, called a catheter, into the space, through which they can inject the anaesthetic. Successful neuraxial anaesthesia, with as few attempts as possible, is important to reduce complications.\nWhat is ultrasound and how it might work?\n\nUltrasound uses high‐frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of the body. The doctor uses a handheld device, called a probe, to send ultrasound waves into the body and create pictures. Conventional neuraxial anaesthesia is performed by using specific anatomical points on the body as a guide. Sometimes the needle does not reach the targeted space, because the anatomical position the doctor thought he or she found by touching the area can be off a bit from the actual position. Ultrasound allows the doctor to see the local anatomy of interest and the size of important structures, and helps to figure out how deep and in what direction to insert the needle.\nTwo ultrasound‐guided methods are commonly used. In the first one, ultrasound is used before the needle is inserted, or pre‐procedural. The second one is referred to as real‐time, which means the needle is inserted first, then moved to the correct spot while watching the ultrasound images.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether it was better to use ultrasound or anatomical landmarks to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We also wanted to find out whether ultrasound guidance led to similar unwanted effects as anatomical landmarks.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated ultrasound guidance compared with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?We found 65 studies with 6823 people. Studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. Four studies evaluated real‐time ultrasound as an intervention.\nCompared to anatomical landmarks, ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts required for successful placement of the needle by an average of 0.41 attempts per person, and reduces the procedure (needling) time by an average of 34 seconds.\nUltrasound guidance likely increases the success rate for first attempts: 778 people out of 1000 experienced successful first attempts with ultrasound guidance, compared to 556 people out of 1000 with anatomical landmarks.\nUltrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure.\nUltrasound guidance may have little to no effect on pain during procedures or unwanted effects, but we are very uncertain about the results.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?We are moderately to highly confident in our findings regarding the number of attempts, the length of time for the procedure, and the rate of first‐attempt success.\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for:\nParticipant satisfaction, because it was difficult to hide who received ultrasound guidance. The results were very inconsistent across the different studies.\nTechnical failure, because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results of this outcome.\nPain during the procedure, because it was difficult to hide who received ultrasound guidance. The results were very inconsistent across the different studies, and the results included both those who experienced pain and those who did not.\nUnwanted effects, because it was difficult to hide who received ultrasound guidance, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. This outcome should also be interpreted with caution, because there were a variety of definitions in each study, such as back pain or headache.\nHow up to date is this evidence?The evidence is up‐to‐date to November 2023.",
