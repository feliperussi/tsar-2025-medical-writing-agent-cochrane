  "abstract": "Rationale\nVisual impairment is a major health concern that predominantly impacts older adults due to age‐related ocular diseases. Visual impairment affects more than 2200 million people worldwide and may lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self‐management interventions. Self‐management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain activities of daily living, and improve overall well‐being.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of self‐management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registries, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was on 19 May 2024.\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multifaceted self‐management interventions in adults with acquired visual impairment (including dual sensory impairment).\n\nOutcomes\nOutcomes assessed were overall and subscores of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision‐related quality of life (VRQoL) scores at the end of follow‐up, adverse events during the study period, and vision‐related living performance measures at the end of follow‐up.\n\nRisk of bias\nWe assessed the risk of bias for three outcomes reported in a summary of findings table using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.\n\nSynthesis methods\nWe synthesized results for each outcome using meta‐analysis where possible, by calculating standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we provided a narrative summary of the results. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.\n\nIncluded studies\nWe included 20 parallel‐group RCTs that enrolled 3151 participants. The size of studies ranged from 30 to 323 participants with a median of 153 participants. Studies were conducted in Asia (two studies), Australia (two), Europe (six), and North America (10) in academic medical centers, hospitals, low‐vision clinics, private practice, rehabilitation centers, and Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The participants were older adults with a mean age across the included studies ranging from 60 to 84 years. The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity ranged from 0.15 to 1.11. Age‐related macular degeneration was the predominant cause of low vision in 15 studies. We did not identify any eligible studies for adults with dual sensory impairment. One study was funded by industry, whereas others received a research grant or support from a non‐profit organization or foundation.\nMultifaceted self‐management interventions included in this review were diverse. The control group was placed on a wait list, while other active controls included usual care, optical aids, or low‐vision rehabilitation.\n\nSynthesis of results\nWe rated the overall risk of bias of included studies as low or some concerns.\nThe meta‐analysis revealed consistent findings across different outcomes and comparisons. For HRQoL, evidence suggests that self‐management intervention may result in little to no difference in HRQoL (change score: SMD −0.09, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.15; I2= 46%; 3 studies, 568 participants; final value: SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.08; I2= 31%; 3 studies, 459 participants; low‐certainty evidence). This finding remained consistent regardless of whether wait list or active control was the comparator.\nFor VRQoL, multifaceted self‐management interventions may result in little to no difference in VRQoL change score compared to active control (SMD −0.12, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.10; I2= 48%; 4 studies, 733 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence from six studies by final values suggests that self‐management intervention may not improve VRQoL compared to control treatment in the longer‐term (6 to 24 months) (SMD −0.01, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.13; I2= 0%; 6 studies, 864 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The conclusion was unchanged, irrespective of the comparator used.\nWe judged the certainty of evidence for both HRQoL and VRQoL as low according to GRADE criteria, downgrading one level for imprecision and one level for unexplained heterogeneity.\nFor harms, self‐management interventions may not affect the risk of adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.66; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 255 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of four studies that reported adverse events, three studies observed no treatment‐related adverse events. One study referred 12 (34%) participants to the general medical practitioner for depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared with seven (22%) participants in the wait list comparison group.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nIn this review, we found low‐certainty evidence that multifaceted self‐management interventions have little or no effects on improving HRQoL and VRQoL for adults with visual impairment. Research is needed to develop more sensitive measures of quality of life and to assess the benefit of such interventions across a broader demographic, including different stages of vision impairment and people with dual‐sensory impairment.\n\nFunding\nCochrane Eyes and Vision US Project is supported by grant UG1EY020522, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health.\n\nRegistration\nProtocol available via doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015790.",
  "pls": "Can self‐management programs improve the quality of life in adults with low vision?\n\nKey messages\nSelf‐management programs (types of education or training that help people learn how to manage their own health) may not improve health‐related or vision‐related quality of life measures in adults with low vision.\nThe evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\nWhat is visual impairment?\n\nVisual impairment refers to a condition where a person's eyesight is reduced and cannot be corrected using eye glasses, contact lenses, or surgery. This leads to difficulties in seeing or interpreting visual information. This impairment can range from partial sight to total blindness, and may result from various causes such as eye diseases, injuries, or congenital conditions (birth defects). Individuals with visual impairment often rely on alternative methods to navigate their surroundings and access information effectively.\nHow is visual impairment treated?\n\nTreatment for visual impairment varies depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. For conditions where eye glasses or contact lenses do not improve vision to a functional level, rehabilitation programs offer support and training to help individuals with visual impairment adapt to their condition, learn new skills, and utilize assistive technologies (products or systems that support and assist) effectively for daily tasks and activities. These learned skills and techniques empower individuals to manage their health conditions effectively.\nWhy is this important?\n\nVisual impairment can impact an individual's quality of life, affecting their ability to perform daily activities, maintain social connections, and enjoy life. Self‐management programs may potentially help individuals adapt to vision loss and improve their well‐being.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether self‐management training is better than usual care for people with low vision.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared self‐management programs with usual care or no program. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence for quality of life and other measures based on factors such as study method and size.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 20 studies with 3151 participants in our review. The studies varied greatly in the type of self‐management programs they used and the outcomes they measured. Overall, we found that self‐management programs may have little to no impact on improving the health‐related and vision‐related quality of life for adults with visual impairment. Out of four studies that looked at harms, three found no unwanted events related to the treatment. In one small study, however, 12 people (equaling about 34 people out of 100) in the self‐management group and seven people (equaling about 22 people out of 100) in the comparison group had to see a doctor for symptoms of depression.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence, because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to May 2024.",
