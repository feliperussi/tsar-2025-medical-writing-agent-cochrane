  "abstract": "Background\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment which, in most cases, can be managed with the appropriate spectacle correction. In 2021, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global target of a 40‐percentage‐point increase in effective coverage of refractive error by 2030. To achieve this global target, equitable access to refractive and optical services within community and primary care settings needs to be strengthened. This review will inform the development of technical guidance to support improvements in the testing and correction of refractive error among World Health Organization (WHO) member states.\n\nObjectives\nTo determine the range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, and the methods employed for their evaluation.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health databases, grey literature, and annual reports and websites of relevant organizations involved in eye‐care delivery from January 2002 to November 2022 to identify approaches for refractive and optical service delivery.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included observational and interventional studies, reviews, and reports from relevant organizations related to delivering refractive services and optical services for preschool and school‐aged children and adults in community and primary care settings published between January 2002 and November 2022. We searched for studies and reports published within the last 20 years because vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error has only recently become a public health and eye health priority, therefore we did not expect to find much relevant literature until after 2002.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts, and extracted data. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We synthesized data, and presented results as tables, figures, and case studies. This project was led by the World Health Organization (WHO) Vision and Eye Care Programme.\n\nMain results\nWe identified 175 studies from searches of databases and grey literature, 146 records from company reports, and 81 records from website searches of relevant organizations that matched our inclusion criteria. Delivery approaches for refractive and optical services in community care included school‐based, pharmacy, and outreach models, whereas primary care approaches comprised vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door‐to‐door delivery. In community care, school‐based and outreach approaches were predominant, while in primary care, a vision‐centre approach was mainly used. In the WHO African region, the school‐based and outreach approaches were mainly reported while, in the Americas, the outreach approach was mostly used. Very few approaches for service delivery were reported in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. Prominent gaps exist in the evaluation of the approaches, and few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nWe comprehensively describe a range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical services in community and primary care. Further evaluation of their effectiveness will better inform the application of these service‐delivery approaches. The study outcomes will help guide WHO member states in strengthening refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels.\n\nFunding\nThis scoping review was supported by the Vision and Eye care Programme, World Health Organization and ATscale Global Partnership.\n\nRegistration\nThe protocol of this scoping review was published in the Open Source Framework.",
  "pls": "What are the different ways eye tests are carried out and spectacles provided in the community and in health clinics worldwide?\n\nKey messages\n1. Outreach (a community‐based approach to provide eye care in various settings, which are often not permanent locations), and school‐based service delivery approaches were mainly used to provide eye care in the community, while vision centres were mainly used in primary care (first‐line health care).\n2. In the World Health Organization (WHO) South‐East Asia region, eye care was most often delivered using outreach and vision centres, whereas in the African region, school‐based delivery and outreach were mainly reported. In the Americas, outreach was mostly used.\n3. We need more information from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, and we need research to evaluate which approaches are most effective.\nWhy is it important to provide eye tests and spectacles?\n\nMany sight problems are easily solved by wearing spectacles (eye‐glasses). However, millions of people around the world don’t have access to the tests and facilities they need to get the correct spectacles. This is a problem for many people because eye care services may be expensive, or located far away. Poor vision can affect children’s ability to learn at school, and lead to people being unable to work.\nGovernments, health services, eye care organizations, and charities use different approaches to provide eye care services to a wide variety of people. This might be by bringing services to people in the community or by providing accessible primary eye care services locally.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is working on advice to countries to help them improve their eye care services. The first step is to understand what eye care services are currently available worldwide, where they are based, and how they work. This information allows us to find the gaps in the evidence, to see where future research should be focused, and will help with the WHO guidance.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for evidence about the different ways people can access eye tests and get spectacles in the community and at local health centres or doctors’ clinics (primary care) anywhere in the world. We needed as much information as possible, so we gathered evidence from medical studies, and also from annual reports and websites of eye care organizations. We grouped the evidence according to the different ways eye tests and spectacles were provided, and we described how and where the services were delivered.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 175 studies, 146 records from eye care organizations and 81 records from websites (402 resources in total), which reported the ways eye care services were delivered in the community or in primary care. Most eye care services included eye tests, assessing the need for spectacles, and providing spectacles. The services were mainly carried out by eye care providers and sometimes with other people, like nurses, doctors and teachers.\nCommunity eye care services are provided where people live or work.\nSchools (154 resources): teachers are trained to give vision tests in school, or eye care workers visit the school to conduct tests. Sometimes a van or bus, equipped as an eye test centre, visits the school. Spectacles are usually prescribed if needed, and follow‐ups or referrals for further eye care can be arranged. Schools sometimes partner with community or primary healthcare centres to provide eye care services.\nPharmacies (3 resources): community pharmacies provide vision tests and spectacles.\nOutreach (157 resources): eye care providers go out into the community to provide care, for example in workplaces or homes. Outreach services are not in a permanent place but may be somewhere for a short period. They often visit very remote areas. They may offer free eye tests and spectacles.\nIn primary care, patients visit a permanent location to receive eye care services.\nVision centres (53 resources) are eye care clinics staffed by trained eye care workers. They carry out tests and provide spectacles. Patients usually pay for spectacles, but they may get a voucher to help with the cost.\nHealth centres (16 resources) are healthcare facilities but not eye care clinics. They usually provide eye tests and spectacles.\nVision and health centres plus door‐to‐door delivery (11 resources): a combination of services provided by vision and health centres and home visits.\nIn the WHO South‐East Asia region, the outreach and vision centre approaches were most common. In the WHO African region, the school‐based and outreach approaches were mainly reported. In the WHO Americas region, the outreach approach was mostly used.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe found very few reports of how eye care services are delivered in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, so our picture of services there is limited. There was limited information about how well the delivery methods worked, so more research is needed about this.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",
