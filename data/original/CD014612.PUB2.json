  "abstract": "Rationale\nInternal hernia is one of the most severe complications observed in people undergoing Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB). There are some who advocate for the closure of defects to prevent internal hernias. However, the closure of these defects might be associated with an increased risk of small bowel obstruction, resulting from a kink in the anastomosis of the small intestines. Currently, there is a lack of robust evidence demonstrating the benefits of defect closure.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the benefits and harms of defect closure for prevention of internal hernia after Roux‐en Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to August 2024. We reviewed the reference lists of included studies and reached out to the study authors to obtain any missing data. We also searched PubMed, grey literature in the OpenGrey database, Clinical Trials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included people with obesity (defined as a body‐mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m²) who underwent laparoscopic or robotic RYGB in bariatric surgery, and compared the closure of defects with the non‐closure of defects. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials, cluster‐RCTs, and cross‐over trials.\n\nOutcomes\nThe critical outcomes assessed were the incidence of internal hernia with bowel obstruction within 10 years, the incidence of postoperative overall complications within 30 days, and the incidence of postoperative mortality within 30 days. The important outcomes included the incidence of intraoperative overall complications, length of hospital stay, and the postoperative pain resulting from gastric bypass surgery, assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) two years after surgery.\n\nRisk of bias\nTwo review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias for each included study using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.\n\nSynthesis methods\nTwo review authors independently assessed the methodological quality and extracted data from the included trials. We performed a random‐effects meta‐analysis for data synthesis. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence based on the GRADE approach.\n\nIncluded studies\nWe identified three RCTs with 3010 participants, which met our inclusion criteria. The closure of mesenteric defects used non‐absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non‐absorbable running sutures in two studies.\n\nSynthesis of results\nThe closure of defects during RYGB may reduce the incidence of internal hernia with bowel obstruction within 10 years compared with non‐closure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.42; P < 0.00001, I² = 0 %; 3 studies, 3010 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative overall complications within 30 days compared to non‐closure (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47; P = 0.35, I² = 0 %; 2 studies, 2609 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative mortality within 30 days compared to non‐closure (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.93; P = 0.50, I² not applicable; 2 studies, 2908 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of intraoperative overall complications compared to non‐closure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.42; P = 0.59, I² not applicable; 1 study, 2507 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Closure defects may lead to the longer length of hospital stay; however, the evidence is very uncertain (MD 0.27 days, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.38; P < 0.00001; I² = 93%; 2 studies, 2609 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).\nPostoperative pain from gastric bypass surgery was not assessed because there was not enough information available for analysis.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe closure of defects may be more effective than the non‐closure of defects for prevention of internal hernia after RYGB. However, the small number of trials limited our confidence in the evidence. There is little to no difference between the closure and non‐closure of defects in the incidence of postoperative overall complications, the incidence of postoperative mortality, and the incidence of intraoperative overall complications. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure than for those who did not have the defects closed. The evidence is very uncertain about the incidence of postoperative mortality, the incidence of intraoperative overall complications, and the length of hospital stay.\nAdditional evidence based on trials designed to be at low risk of bias and with an adequate sample size is imperative.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.\n\nRegistration\nThe protocol was registered in the Cochrane Library on 9 May 2023.",
  "pls": "Closure of defects or non‐closure of defects: which works better to prevent internal hernia after bariatric surgery?\n\nReview question\nDoes closing defects after Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in bariatric surgery prevent internal hernias?\nKey messages\nDue to a lack of evidence, it is unclear whether closing defects is better than not closing defects in preventing internal hernias after bariatric surgery.\nClosing defects may reduce the number of internal hernias compared to not closing them.\nBackground\nAn internal hernia is a serious problem that can happen after a type of weight‐loss surgery called Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB). During this surgery, a small pouch is made from the stomach and connected directly to the small intestine. An internal hernia occurs when the small bowel goes through a hole created by the RYGB. If not detected or treated in time, it can be very dangerous. An internal hernia can cut off blood supply to part of the intestines, leading to tissue death. Emergency surgery is needed to treat this, and it often involves removing the damaged part of the intestine and reconnecting the healthy parts. Closing the defects is recommended to prevent internal hernias. However, closing defects might be associated with an increased risk of the surgical connection between small intestines becoming kinked. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that shows the benefits of defect closure.\nWhat is internal hernia?\n\nDefinition. An internal hernia occurs when the intestines move into spaces where they do not usually go, through defects inside the abdomen.\nCause. This can happen after some obesity surgeries, which create new pathways for the intestines. These new pathways can sometimes have defects where the intestines can get stuck.\nSymptoms. When the intestines get stuck, it can cause symptoms, such as pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating.\nWhat is Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB)?\n\nRoux‐en‐Y gastric bypass surgery involves two main steps. First, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. Second, the small intestine is cut and connected to this pouch, bypassing the rest of the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine. This reduces the amount of food you can eat and absorb.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether closing defects is better than not closing them, and whether closing them is better and safer for preventing internal hernia after bariatric surgery.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomised clinical trials that compared closure of defects with non‐closure of defects. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We investigated how successful closure of defects prevents internal hernias after bariatric surgery. In addition, we evaluated the harmful events and the length of hospital stay.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found three studies, with 3010 participants, which compared closure of defects with non‐closure of defects. The studies were conducted in Denmark, the United States, and Sweden.\nMain results\nCompared with non‐closure of defects, closure of defects:\nmay reduce internal hernias;\nmay make little to no difference in complications after the surgery;\nmay make little to no difference in death after the surgery;\nmay make little to no difference in overall complications;\nmay lead to a longer length of hospital stay.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited because the results are from only three studies.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to August 2024.",
