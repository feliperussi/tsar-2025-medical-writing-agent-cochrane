  "abstract": "Rationale\nThis is the third update of a Cochrane review first published in 2015 and last updated in 2021.\nAppendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is performed primarily for acute appendicitis. People who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, defined as gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, are more likely to suffer postoperative complications in comparison to uncomplicated appendicitis. The routine use of abdominal drainage to reduce postoperative complications after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is controversial.\n\nObjectives\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy (irrespective of open or laparoscopic) for complicated appendicitis; to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains; and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and five trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors, to identify studies for inclusion in the review. The latest search date was 12 October 2023.\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in people with complicated appendicitis comparing (1) use of drain versus no drain, (2) open drain versus closed drain, or (3) different schedules for drain removal. We excluded studies in which not all participants received antibiotics after appendectomy.\n\nOutcomes\nOur critical outcome was intraperitoneal abscess. Important outcomes were wound infection, morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay.\n\nRisk of bias\nWe used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias in RCTs and quasi‐RCTs.\n\nSynthesis methods\nWe synthesised the results for each outcome in a meta‐analysis using the random‐effects model, except for the Peto odds ratio, which only has a fixed‐effect model. We planned to use the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis (SWiM) approach to report studies when it was not possible to undertake a meta‐analysis of effect estimates. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\nIncluded studies\nWe included eight studies (five RCTs and three quasi‐RCTs) with a total of 739 paediatric and adult participants, of which 370 participants were randomised to the drainage group and 369 participants to the no‐drainage group. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. All studies were at overall high risk of bias.\n\nSynthesis of results\nUse of drain versus no drain\nWe assessed the certainty of the evidence for 30‐day mortality as moderate due to imprecision. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for all other outcomes as very low, downgraded mainly due to high risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.\nThe evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 2.12; 7 studies, 671 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), wound infection at 30 days (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.45; 7 studies, 696 participants), and morbidity at 30 days (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.14 to 24.50; 2 studies, 124 participants) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Approximately 113 (57 to 221 participants) out of 1000 participants in the drainage group developed intraperitoneal abscess, compared with 104 out of 1000 participants in the no‐drainage group. There were seven deaths in the drainage group (N = 291) compared with one in the no‐drainage group (N = 290); abdominal drainage probably increases the risk of 30‐day mortality (Peto odds ratio 4.88, 95% CI 1.18 to 20.09; 6 studies, 581 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay by 1.58 days (95% CI 0.86 to 2.31; 5 studies, 516 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, but the evidence is very uncertain.\nOpen drain versus closed drain\nNo studies compared open drain versus closed drain for complicated appendicitis.\nEarly versus late drain removal\nNo studies compared early versus late drain removal for complicated appendicitis.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe evidence is very uncertain whether abdominal drainage prevents intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, but the evidence is very uncertain. Consequently, there is no evidence for any clinical improvement with the use of abdominal drainage in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The increased risk of mortality with drainage comes from eight deaths observed in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Larger studies are needed to more reliably determine the effects of drainage on mortality outcomes.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane review was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81701950, 82172135), Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (Grant No. CSTB2022NSCQ‐MSX0058, cstc2021jcyj‐msxmX0294), Medical Research Projects of Chongqing (Grant No. 2018MSXM132, 2023ZDXM003, 2024jstg028), and the Kuanren Talents Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.\n\nRegistration\nRegistration: not available.Protocol and previous versions available via doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010168, doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010168.pub2, doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010168.pub3, and doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010168.pub4.",
  "pls": "What are the effects of using a drain compared to no drain after surgical removal of the appendix for treating complicated appendicitis?\n\nKey messages\n• We do not know if drain (tube) use after open (where a large cut is made to access underlying organs or tissues) or keyhole (surgery performed through a very small surgical cut) removal of the appendix has an important effect on the abdominal abscess (collection of pus in the abdomen) rate, wound infection rate, or overall complication rate in children and adults with complicated appendicitis (death, decay, or perforation of the appendix).\n• Use of drain after open removal of the appendix probably increases the death rate in children and adults with complicated appendicitis.\n• Use of drain after open or keyhole removal of the appendix may increase the length of hospital stay in children and adults with complicated appendicitis, but we are very uncertain about the results.\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\n\nThe human appendix is a tube located at the connection between the small and large intestines. The term 'appendicitis' covers a variety of conditions resulting from painful swelling of the appendix. Complicated appendicitis is defined as gangrenous appendicitis (death and decay of the appendix) or perforated appendicitis (bursting of the appendix).\nHow is this managed?\n\nPeople with complicated appendicitis (gangrenous or perforated appendicitis) usually need surgical removal of the appendix to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. Individuals undergoing surgical removal of the appendix for complicated appendicitis are more likely to suffer complications after surgery in comparison to uncomplicated appendicitis. The routine placement of a surgical drain to prevent abdominal abscess after surgical removal of the appendix for complicated appendicitis has been questioned. Use of a drain may decrease the risk of abdominal abscess, but it may also have no benefit and may even cause harm.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether the use of a drain after open or keyhole removal of the appendix is effective in reducing the abdominal abscess rate for people with complicated appendicitis in any care setting.\nWe wanted to compare the use of a drain versus no drain by looking at:\n• abdominal abscess rate;\n• wound infection rate;\n• overall complication rate;\n• death rate;\n• length of hospital stay.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the use of a drain with no drain after surgical removal of the appendix for people with complicated appendicitis. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found eight studies in which 739 children and adults with complicated appendicitis were randomly assigned to either use of drain (370 participants) or no drain (369 participants) after open or keyhole removal of the appendix.\nWe are uncertain whether the use of a drain in children and adults after open or keyhole removal of the appendix reduces:\n• abdominal abscess rate (9 more abdominal abscesses per 1000 participants);\n• wound infection rate; or\n• overall complication rate.\nCompared with no drain, the use of a drain probably increases the death rate in children and adults after open removal of the appendix. Use of a drain may increase the length of hospital stay in children and adults after open or keyhole removal of the appendix, but we are very uncertain about this result.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. In addition, some studies did not clearly report how they were conducted, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to October 2023.",
