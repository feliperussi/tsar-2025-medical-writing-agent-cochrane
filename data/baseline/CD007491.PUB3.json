    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nReceiving hospital-level care at home instead of in the hospital: what are the effects?\n\nKey Messages\n– For some older people who need to be admitted to hospital for a sudden illness, receiving hospital-level care at home probably makes little or no difference to their health or risk of dying compared to being treated in the hospital.\n\n– People who receive 'hospital at home' care are probably less likely to need to move into a residential care home afterwards. They may also be more satisfied with the care they receive.\n\n– 'Hospital at home' services probably cost less for the health service than admitting people to the hospital.\n\nWhat is 'hospital at home'?\nSometimes, a person develops a sudden illness (an acute condition) that is serious enough to need hospital care. Instead of being admitted to a hospital ward, some people can receive similar treatment from doctors and nurses in their own home.\n\nThis is often called 'hospital at home'. This type of care is for a short time, until the person gets better. People receiving this care can be moved to a hospital if they need to be.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if 'hospital at home' is a good alternative to being cared for in a hospital for people with a sudden illness. We were especially interested in how it affected older people.\n\nWe looked at:\n– how many people died\n– whether people needed to go back to the hospital later\n– whether people needed to move into a care home\n– how satisfied people were with their care\n– the costs for the health service\n– any unwanted effects of the treatment\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared 'hospital at home' services with usual hospital care. The studies included people who needed to be admitted to the hospital for a sudden illness.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that included a total of 3100 people. Most of the people in the studies were older and had a range of sudden medical problems, such as breathing difficulties or recovering from a stroke. The studies compared people who received 'hospital at home' care with people who were treated in the hospital.\n\nWe found that for older people, being treated at home probably makes little or no difference to their overall health or their risk of dying within six months, compared to being in the hospital. It also probably makes little or no difference to their chances of needing to be readmitted to the hospital later.\n\nHowever, people treated at home were probably less likely to need to move into a residential care home in the six months after their illness.\n\nPeople may be more satisfied with 'hospital at home' care, but we are less certain about this finding. The studies also showed that 'hospital at home' probably costs less than care in a hospital.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in most of the results is moderate. This means that future research is unlikely to change our main conclusions.\n\nHowever, our confidence in the finding about patient satisfaction is lower. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were designed. It is possible that new research could change this result.\n\nWe also found very little information about how 'hospital at home' affects family members or caregivers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
