    "output": "Can a simple physical exam help find the cause of severe dizziness?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Acute vestibular syndrome is a type of sudden, severe dizziness. It can be caused by a less serious problem with the inner ear or a more serious problem with the brain, like a stroke.\n– A three-part physical exam called HINTS seems to be good at correctly identifying when dizziness is caused by a brain problem. However, the test is less accurate at ruling out a brain problem, which means some people might have extra scans they do not need.\n– We are not very confident in these results because there were problems with how the studies were done. More research is needed to be sure about how accurate the HINTS test is.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome?\n\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a condition that starts suddenly and causes severe dizziness or a spinning feeling (vertigo). People with AVS can also feel sick, vomit, and be unsteady on their feet. They may also have nystagmus, which is when the eyes make rapid, uncontrolled movements.\n\nAVS can be caused by two main types of problems:\n– A 'peripheral' cause, which is a problem with the balance organs in the inner ear. This is the most common cause and is not usually life-threatening.\n– A 'central' cause, which is a problem in the brain, such as a stroke. This is less common but much more serious.\n\nBecause the treatments are very different, it is important for doctors to quickly find out what is causing the AVS.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how accurate a physical exam called HINTS is for telling the difference between a central (brain) cause and a peripheral (inner ear) cause of AVS.\n\nThe HINTS exam has three parts:\n– Head Impulse: The doctor gently but quickly turns the person's head to see how their eyes react.\n– Nystagmus: The doctor looks at the direction of the person's uncontrolled eye movements.\n– Test of Skew: The doctor covers and uncovers each eye to see if they are aligned with each other.\n\nSome doctors use a 'HINTS Plus' exam, which adds a hearing test. We wanted to know how accurate both tests were at finding a central cause for AVS.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that used the HINTS or HINTS Plus exam to diagnose the cause of AVS. The people in the studies had their diagnosis confirmed by a brain scan, like an MRI, or by a specialist doctor (a neurologist).\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 16 studies that included a total of 2024 people with AVS. Most of the studies took place in a hospital emergency department, and the tests were often done by neurologists.\n\nThe HINTS exam\nWhen performed by a trained healthcare professional, the HINTS exam correctly identified most people who had a central (brain) cause for their dizziness. However, the test sometimes suggested a brain problem in people who actually had an inner ear problem. This means that some people might be sent for unnecessary brain scans.\n\nThe HINTS Plus exam\nAdding a hearing test (HINTS Plus) gave similar results. It was good at identifying people with a brain problem but was less accurate at identifying those with an inner ear problem.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to know if recording the eye movements on video made the test more accurate.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because there were problems with how some of the studies were designed and carried out.\n\nAlso, most studies were done by specialist doctors in emergency departments. We do not know if the test would be as accurate if it was used by other healthcare professionals, like family doctors, or in other settings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
