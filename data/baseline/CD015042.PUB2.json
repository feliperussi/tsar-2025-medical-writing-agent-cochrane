    "output": "Talking therapies to help pregnant people stop or reduce drinking alcohol\n\nKey Messages\n– Brief talking therapies (also called psychosocial interventions) may help more pregnant people to stop drinking alcohol completely compared to usual care. However, we are not very confident in this result.\n– We are very uncertain if these talking therapies help pregnant people reduce the amount of alcohol they drink on the days they do drink.\n– We did not find any studies that looked at whether medicines can help pregnant people stop or reduce drinking alcohol.\n\nWhat is alcohol use during pregnancy?\nDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can be harmful to a developing baby. Despite these known risks, some people find it difficult to stop drinking when they become pregnant. Health experts advise that the safest approach is to not drink any alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if talking therapies or medicines could help pregnant people stop or reduce drinking alcohol.\n\nWe were interested in how these treatments affected:\n– whether people stopped drinking alcohol completely\n– whether people drank less alcohol\n– whether people stayed in the treatment program\n– any unwanted effects of the treatments\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at talking therapies or medicines compared with no treatment or usual care in pregnant people who drink alcohol.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included 1369 pregnant people. The studies took place in the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands.\n\nAll 8 studies looked at talking therapies. These were often brief, involving one to five short sessions with a healthcare worker. We did not find any studies that looked at medicines.\n\nIn the studies, one group of people received a talking therapy. The other group received usual care, which included an assessment of their drinking and advice to stop.\n\nOur main findings are:\n– People who received a brief talking therapy may be more likely to stop drinking alcohol completely compared to those who received usual care.\n– We are very uncertain if talking therapies help people reduce the number of alcoholic drinks they have on the days they drink.\n– Talking therapies probably make little to no difference in whether people complete the treatment program.\n– None of the studies reported on any unwanted effects of the treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were done. Also, some of the studies were small, which makes the results less certain.\n\nWe need more and better studies to be more confident about the effects of talking therapies for pregnant people who drink alcohol. We also need studies that look at the safety and benefits of medicines.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024."
