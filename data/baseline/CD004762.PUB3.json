    "output": "Medicines for muscle stiffness in myotonic disorders\n\nKey Messages\n- For people with a condition called non-dystrophic myotonia, the medicine mexiletine likely reduces muscle stiffness and improves quality of life. The medicine lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and likely improves quality of life.\n- For people with a different condition called myotonic dystrophy, it is less clear if medicines help. Mexiletine may help muscles relax faster but may not improve quality of life.\n- Both mexiletine and lamotrigine can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is when muscles have trouble relaxing after being used. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, muscle locking, pain, and tiredness. These symptoms can make daily activities difficult.\n\nThere are two main types of myotonic disorders.\n- Non-dystrophic myotonia is a condition that mainly affects the muscles, causing stiffness.\n- Myotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects the whole body. It causes muscle stiffness and weakness, but also other problems like heart rhythm changes and cloudy areas in the eyes (cataracts).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if medicines can help reduce muscle stiffness and other symptoms for people with myotonic disorders. We also wanted to know if these medicines cause any unwanted effects.\n\nWe were interested in how the medicines affected:\n- people's own reports of their muscle stiffness\n- how quickly muscles could relax\n- quality of life\n- any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines with a dummy pill (placebo) or no treatment for people with myotonia. A placebo is a treatment that looks the same as the real medicine but has no active ingredients.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies that included a total of 392 people. Most studies looked at people with either myotonic dystrophy or non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia\n- Mexiletine: We are quite confident that mexiletine reduces muscle stiffness. People taking it reported less stiffness in a daily diary. It also likely improves hand grip strength and quality of life. However, people taking mexiletine had more unwanted effects than those taking a placebo. The most common were stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine: We are less confident about the effects of lamotrigine. It may help muscles in the hands and eyelids relax faster. We are quite confident that it improves quality of life. People taking lamotrigine had more unwanted effects than those taking a placebo, including headaches, tiredness, and rash.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy\n- Mexiletine: We are quite confident that mexiletine helps hand muscles relax faster. However, the evidence suggests it may not improve quality of life. People taking mexiletine had more unwanted effects than those taking a placebo, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches. The studies did not report on whether people felt their overall stiffness improved.\n\nOther medicines\nSeveral other medicines were tested in small studies. We are very uncertain about their effects because the studies were too small or had problems in how they were done.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence ranges from quite confident to very uncertain.\n\nFor some results, our confidence is lower because the studies were very small. When studies are small, their results can be less reliable. Some studies also had problems with how they were designed or carried out, which could affect the results.\n\nNot all studies measured the things that are most important to people, like how much their overall stiffness improved.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
