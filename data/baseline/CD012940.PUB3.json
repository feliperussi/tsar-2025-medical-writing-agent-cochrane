    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nFor preterm babies fed by a tube, is it better to put leftover milk back into the stomach or throw it away?\n\nKey Messages\n– Preterm babies (babies born too early) are often fed milk through a thin tube that goes into their stomach. Before each feed, nurses may check for leftover milk from the last feed. This is called a gastric residual.\n– We are not sure if it is better to put this leftover milk back into the baby’s stomach (re-feeding) or to throw it away (discarding).\n– Evidence from one small study suggests that re-feeding may make little or no difference to a baby’s health. This includes their weight gain, time to get to full milk feeds, or their risk of developing a serious gut problem. However, because there is so little research, we are not confident in these findings.\n\nWhat is feeding for preterm infants?\nBabies born preterm have bodies that are not fully developed. They often cannot feed from a breast or bottle because their sucking and swallowing reflexes are not strong enough. To make sure they get the nutrition they need to grow, they are fed milk through a thin, soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. This is called tube feeding.\n\nTo check how well a baby is digesting the milk, nurses sometimes use a syringe to gently draw out any milk left in the baby’s stomach from the last feed. This leftover milk is called a gastric residual. Doctors and nurses have different opinions on what to do with this leftover milk. Some believe putting it back helps with digestion. Others worry that putting it back could cause problems like vomiting or serious infections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if it was better and safer for preterm babies to have their gastric residuals put back into their stomach (re-feeding) or thrown away (discarding).\n\nWe were interested in how these two approaches affected:\n– how quickly babies got back to their birth weight\n– the risk of developing a serious gut problem called necrotising enterocolitis\n– how long it took for babies to take all their milk feeds through the tube\n– how many days they needed nutrition given through a vein\n– any other unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at re-feeding gastric residuals compared with discarding them in preterm babies. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 72 babies born preterm. The study compared putting leftover milk back into the stomach with throwing it away.\n\nThe results suggest that putting the milk back may make little or no difference to:\n– how long it took for babies to get back to their birth weight\n– the risk of developing a serious gut problem or a hole in the intestine\n– the risk of dying before leaving the hospital\n– how long it took to get to full milk feeds\n– the number of days babies needed nutrition through a vein\n– poor growth by the time they left the hospital\n\nWe are very uncertain about the effect on how often feeds had to be stopped for 12 hours or more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is low. This is because our findings are based on only one small study. Also, in the study, the doctors and nurses knew which treatment each baby was getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals. More and larger studies are needed to provide a clear answer for doctors and nurses.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
