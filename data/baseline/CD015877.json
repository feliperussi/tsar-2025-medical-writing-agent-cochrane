    "output": "Personalized diet advice for children and teenagers with obesity: does it work better than standard advice?\n\nKey messages\n\n– 'Precision nutrition' is a new way of giving diet advice that is personalized for each person. It uses information like their genes, lifestyle, and health to create a unique plan. This is different from the usual 'one-size-fits-all' diet advice given to everyone.\n\n– We wanted to know if this personalized advice helps children and teenagers with obesity manage their weight better than standard advice.\n\n– We found only two very small studies. Because of this, we are very uncertain about the effects of personalized diet advice on weight or Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of weight in relation to height. We need more and better research to know if it is helpful.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and teenagers?\n\nHaving overweight or obesity means having more body fat than is healthy for your age and height. This can increase the risk of health problems later in life, such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\nDoctors often use a measure called Body Mass Index (BMI) to check if a child or teenager's weight is in a healthy range. BMI is calculated using a person's weight and height.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nStandard diet advice for managing weight is often the same for everyone. A newer approach, called 'precision nutrition', creates a diet plan tailored to each person based on their unique characteristics.\n\nWe wanted to find out if personalized diet advice works better than standard advice for children and teenagers (up to 19 years old) with obesity.\n\nWe were interested in the effects on:\n– weight and Body Mass Index (BMI)\n– mental and physical well-being\n– quality of life\n– any unwanted effects of the advice\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at personalized diet advice compared with standard diet advice or no advice in children and teenagers with obesity.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies we found. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 105 children and teenagers. The studies were small and followed the participants for a short time.\n\nOne study used a computer program to create personalized diet plans based on each person's information. It compared this to standard diet advice.\n\nThe results from this small study were not clear. We are very uncertain whether personalized diet advice has any effect on weight or BMI in children and teenagers compared to standard advice.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the findings.\n\nThis is because we only found two very small studies. When studies have few people, the results can be unreliable. There were also some problems with how the studies were done, which could have affected their results.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about whether personalized diet advice is helpful. More research is needed in this new area.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
