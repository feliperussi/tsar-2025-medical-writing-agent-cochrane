    "output": "Which way of doing pelvic floor muscle exercises is best for bladder leakage in women?\n\nKey Messages\n\n- Pelvic floor muscle exercises involve squeezing and relaxing the muscles that support the bladder. For women with urinary incontinence (leaking urine), exercises that focus only on these muscles may improve quality of life more than general body exercises.\n- Doing pelvic floor muscle exercises more days per week may greatly improve quality of life compared to doing them fewer days per week.\n- It probably makes little to no difference to quality of life whether women do these exercises with one-on-one supervision or in a group setting.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence?\n\nUrinary incontinence is when you leak urine by accident. It is a common problem for women. The pelvic floor is a group of muscles that supports the bladder and other organs. When these muscles are weak, it can lead to different types of leakage:\n\n- Stress incontinence: leaking urine when you cough, sneeze, or exercise.\n- Urge incontinence: a sudden, strong need to urinate, followed by leakage.\n- Mixed incontinence: a combination of both stress and urge incontinence.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nPelvic floor muscle training is a recommended treatment for urinary incontinence. This involves doing special exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. However, these exercises can be taught and done in many different ways.\n\nWe wanted to find out which approaches to pelvic floor muscle exercises work best for women with urinary incontinence. We were most interested in how different approaches affected:\n- quality of life\n- any unwanted side effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle exercises. The studies included women with stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 63 studies that included 4920 women. Most women in the studies were middle-aged and had stress incontinence or a mix of stress and urge incontinence.\n\nWe grouped the studies based on what they compared: the type of exercise, the dose (how much or how often), and how the training was delivered (for example, in a clinic or at home).\n\n**Type of exercise**\n- Exercises that focus only on squeezing the pelvic floor muscles may improve quality of life more than exercises that do not focus on these muscles.\n- Combining pelvic floor exercises with other body movements (like Pilates) may slightly improve quality of life compared to doing only pelvic floor exercises.\n\n**Dose of exercise**\n- Doing pelvic floor exercises more days per week may greatly improve quality of life compared to doing them fewer days per week.\n- We are very uncertain if using a resistance device (like a vaginal weight) during exercises helps. The evidence suggests it may be slightly better to do the exercises without a device.\n\n**Delivery of exercise training**\n- It probably makes little to no difference to quality of life whether the exercises are supervised one-on-one with a health professional or in a group.\n- We are very uncertain if supervision in a clinic is better than doing the exercises at home without supervision.\n- Using an e-health app to learn the exercises may slightly improve quality of life compared to using written instructions.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\nA small number of women reported unwanted effects. These were mostly minor and happened when using a device inside the vagina to help with the exercises. The effects included discomfort, vaginal discharge, or light bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in many of the results. This is because of several issues:\n- There were problems with how some of the studies were done.\n- For many comparisons, there were only a few small studies.\n- The results from different studies were sometimes inconsistent.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure about many of the findings. More and better studies are needed to find out the best ways to do pelvic floor muscle exercises.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
