    "output": "What do patients, doctors, and policymakers think about general health checks?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Even though a previous review found that general health checks may not prevent serious illness or death, they are still popular with patients, healthcare staff, and health system managers.\n\n– People who have health checks say they feel reassured and motivated to live a healthier lifestyle. However, things like fear of bad results, cost, and lack of time can stop people from getting a check.\n\n– Doctors and nurses believe health checks should be tailored to each person’s individual health risks. They face challenges in providing these checks, such as not having enough time or staff.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\n\nA general health check is a set of tests to check a person's overall health. They are for people who do not have any symptoms of being sick. The goal is to find health problems early to reduce future illness and death. Health checks are offered in many places, such as doctors' offices, community centers, or workplaces.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nA previous review of studies found that general health checks have little or no effect on preventing death or major illnesses like cancer or heart disease.\n\nBecause of this, we wanted to understand why these checks are still so popular. We wanted to find out what different groups of people think and feel about general health checks. These groups included:\n– people who have health checks (patients)\n– doctors, nurses, and other healthcare staff who provide them\n– health system managers and policymakers who set them up\n\nWe wanted to know what factors influence the decision to offer health checks, how they are provided, and why people choose to have them.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that explored people's experiences and views on general health checks. These studies used methods like interviews and group discussions to collect information.\n\nWe found 146 studies and chose 36 of the most relevant ones for our review. These studies came from different countries and settings around the world. We compared and summarized the results of the studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe 36 studies included the views of patients, healthcare staff, and health system managers.\n\nWhy people value health checks\nPeople said that health checks motivated them to make positive lifestyle changes, like eating better or exercising more. They felt reassured when the results confirmed they were healthy. Many people also felt a sense of responsibility to their families and society to stay healthy, and they saw health checks as a way to do that.\n\nWhat stops people from getting a health check\nSome people were afraid of getting bad results, so they avoided getting a check. Others preferred to see a doctor only when they felt sick. Practical problems also stopped people from going, such as not having enough time, worrying about the cost, or being concerned that their insurance would not cover treatment if a problem was found. A good relationship with a doctor or nurse was important, and a bad experience could discourage people from attending.\n\nViews of healthcare staff and managers\nHealthcare staff and patients agreed that it was very important for the person doing the health check to be skilled and to understand different cultural backgrounds.\n\nHowever, healthcare staff reported challenges in providing health checks. These included not having enough time to see patients who were already sick, staff shortages, and lack of resources.\n\nHealthcare staff often thought that health checks should be personalized based on a person's age, family history, and lifestyle. Patients, on the other hand, sometimes preferred a more general approach with a wide range of tests.\n\nEveryone agreed that providing clear information about health checks, explaining the results well, and giving practical advice were key parts of a good health check.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the findings varies. We are quite confident that people's personal beliefs about health and disease affect their decision to get a health check. We are also confident that practical issues like time and cost are major barriers for many people.\n\nWe are less confident about other findings. For example, the studies did not give us a clear picture of why policymakers decide to set up health check programs. We also have less confidence in the findings about the best way to explain test results to patients. Most of the studies were from high-income countries, so the views might be different for people living in other parts of the world.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
