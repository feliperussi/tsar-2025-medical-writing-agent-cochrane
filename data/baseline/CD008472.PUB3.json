    "output": "Remote ischaemic preconditioning for people having major surgery on their blood vessels\n\nKey messages\n\n– Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a limb, like an arm, is temporarily stopped and restarted a few times before surgery. This is done using a cuff, similar to one used for taking blood pressure.\n\n– For people having planned major surgery on their blood vessels, RIPC probably makes little to no difference to the risk of dying during or soon after surgery.\n\n– RIPC also probably makes little to no difference to the risk of having a heart attack, kidney problems, or a stroke after the surgery.\n\nWhat is major blood vessel surgery?\n\nMajor blood vessel surgery, also called vascular surgery, is an operation to fix problems in the body's main arteries and veins. These problems can include blockages that stop blood from flowing properly or weak spots in a blood vessel wall that bulge outwards.\n\nThese are serious operations that carry risks of major problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death. Researchers are looking for ways to make these surgeries safer for patients.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) before major blood vessel surgery helps to protect people from harm.\n\nWe compared people who received RIPC before their surgery with people who did not receive it. We were interested in the effects on:\n\n– death during or soon after surgery\n– heart attack\n- kidney problems\n– stroke\n– loss of a limb\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– how long the surgery took\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at remote ischaemic preconditioning compared with no preconditioning in people having planned major blood vessel surgery.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1295 people. Most of the people in the studies were men, and their average age was around 70 years old.\n\nWe found that using RIPC before surgery probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die during or shortly after their operation.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that RIPC probably makes little to no difference in the risk of having a heart attack, kidney problems, or a stroke. It also likely does not affect how long people stay in the hospital or how long their surgery lasts.\n\nWe are less certain about the effect of RIPC on the risk of losing a limb, but it may also make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is moderate for most outcomes. This is mainly because some of the studies were small. When we combined their results, the findings were not very precise. This means the true effect of RIPC could be different from what the studies found.\n\nFor some outcomes, like limb loss, we are less confident because there were only a few studies that looked at them. More well-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of RIPC.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022."
