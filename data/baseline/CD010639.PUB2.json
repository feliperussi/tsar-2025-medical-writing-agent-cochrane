    "output": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep for workers?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Limiting work shifts to a maximum of 16 hours may help workers get more sleep when they are off duty and feel less sleepy during their shifts.\n\n– For other types of schedule changes, such as how quickly shifts change or the direction they rotate (for example, from morning to afternoon to night), we are very uncertain about their effects on sleep and sleepiness.\n\n– We need more and better studies to understand how to design shift schedules to improve sleep for workers.\n\nWhat is shift work and how does it affect sleep?\n\nShift work means working outside of typical daytime hours, such as in the evening, overnight, or on rotating schedules. This type of work can disrupt the body's natural 24-hour cycle, which tells us when to be awake and when to sleep.\n\nBecause of this disruption, many shift workers do not get enough sleep or have poor quality sleep. This can make them feel very tired during their shifts. Being sleepy at work can affect a worker's health, well-being, and safety on the job.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if changing shift work schedules could help workers get better sleep and feel less sleepy. We were interested in the effects of different schedule changes on:\n\n– sleep quality when not at work\n– how long workers slept when not at work\n– how sleepy workers felt during their shifts\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at different types of shift schedules for shift workers. The studies could change things like the length of shifts, the direction of rotation (for example, morning to afternoon to night), or how much time off workers had between shifts.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies that included a total of 2125 shift workers. The studies looked at several different types of schedule changes.\n\nLimiting shift length\nTwo studies looked at limiting workweeks to 80 hours with a maximum shift length of 16 hours. We are moderately confident that this change helps workers feel less sleepy during their shifts. The evidence also suggests it may help them get more sleep when they are off duty, but we are less confident about this.\n\nDirection of shift changes\nThree studies compared schedules that moved forward (from morning to afternoon to night shifts) with schedules that moved backward (from night to afternoon to morning shifts). We are very uncertain about the results, but forward rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts.\n\nSpeed of shift changes\nThree studies compared schedules that changed shifts quickly (for example, every 2 to 4 days) with schedules that changed more slowly. We are very uncertain about the results. Faster changes might reduce how long workers sleep.\n\nOther schedule changes\nSome studies looked at using shorter shifts (8 to 10 hours) or grouping workdays more closely together. We are very uncertain if these changes affect sleep quality or how long people sleep.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for several reasons. Many of the studies we found were small, and there were some problems with how they were done, which could affect the results.\n\nThe studies also looked at many different types of schedule changes and measured sleep in different ways. This made it difficult to compare their findings. For many types of schedule changes, we found no studies at all. This means we still do not have a clear picture of what works best for most shift workers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022."
