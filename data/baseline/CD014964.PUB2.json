    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nUsing ultrasound to guide anaesthetic injections in the back: does it work better than the usual method?\n\nKey Messages\n– Neuraxial anaesthesia is an injection in the back that numbs parts of the body for surgery or childbirth. Examples include epidurals and spinal blocks. Doctors usually find the right spot by feeling for bones in the back. Another way is to use an ultrasound scanner, which shows a picture of the spine to help guide the needle.\n\n– Using an ultrasound scanner to guide the needle probably helps doctors succeed on the first try. It also reduces the number of attempts needed and makes the procedure quicker compared to the usual method of feeling for bones.\n\n– We are not sure if using ultrasound makes a difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure, how much pain they feel, or the number of unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief used during surgery and childbirth. A doctor injects medicine near the spinal cord in your back. This numbs the lower half of your body but allows you to stay awake. The most common types are epidurals and spinal blocks.\n\nTo give the injection, the doctor needs to find a very small space between the bones of the spine. Usually, they do this by feeling the bones on a person's back. This is called the 'anatomical landmark' method. However, it can be difficult to find the right spot, and it might take several tries with the needle. Using an ultrasound scanner can help the doctor see the bones and spaces in the spine on a screen, which may make it easier to guide the needle to the correct place.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide neuraxial anaesthesia is better than the usual method of feeling for bones.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how many tries it took to place the needle correctly\n– how long the procedure took\n– how satisfied people were with the procedure\n– whether the needle was placed correctly on the first try\n– whether the procedure failed completely\n– how much pain people felt during the procedure\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with using anatomical landmarks in adults having neuraxial anaesthesia.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that included 6823 people. The studies took place in countries all over the world. About half of the people in the studies were having a baby. The other half were having different types of surgery.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\nNumber of attempts and procedure time\nWe are confident that using ultrasound reduces the number of needle pokes needed to get the anaesthetic in the right place. It also makes the procedure quicker.\n\nSuccess on the first try\nUsing ultrasound probably increases the chance of the needle being placed correctly on the first try.\n\nPatient satisfaction and procedure failure\nUltrasound may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure. It also may not change the number of times the procedure fails completely. However, we are not very confident in these results.\n\nPain and unwanted effects\nWe are very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure or on the risk of unwanted side effects. The evidence did not give us a clear answer on these points.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident in the evidence for the number of attempts and the time the procedure takes.\n\nOur confidence in the other results is lower. For some outcomes, like patient satisfaction and pain, the studies measured them in different ways, which made it hard to compare them. Some studies also had problems with how they were designed. This means we are less certain about the effects of ultrasound on patient satisfaction, pain, and unwanted side effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023."
