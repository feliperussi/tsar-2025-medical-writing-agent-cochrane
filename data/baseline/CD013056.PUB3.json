    "output": "Antibiotics or antiseptics for a long-lasting ear infection with discharge?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For people with a long-lasting ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media), using antibiotic eardrops (quinolones) is likely better at stopping the discharge within two weeks compared to antiseptic eardrops (boric acid).\n\n– For other types of antibiotics and antiseptics, we are not sure which works better because there was not enough good evidence to compare them.\n\n– The studies did not provide much information about unwanted effects, so we are uncertain about the risks of these treatments.\n\nWhat is a long-lasting ear infection with discharge?\n\nA long-lasting ear infection with discharge is also called chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). It is a long-term swelling and infection of the middle ear, which is the space behind the eardrum. This condition happens when there is a hole in the eardrum that does not heal.\n\nThe main symptoms are a discharge from the ear that can last for many weeks and hearing loss.\n\nHow are these infections treated?\n\nTreatments aim to kill the germs that cause the infection. Two common types of treatment are antibiotics and antiseptics.\n\n– Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria.\n– Antiseptics are substances that stop or slow down the growth of germs.\n\nThese treatments can be given as eardrops put directly into the ear. They can also be given as pills or injections that work throughout the body.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if antibiotics or antiseptics are better for treating people with a long-lasting ear infection with discharge.\n\nWe were interested in how these treatments affected:\n– stopping the ear discharge (making the ear 'dry')\n– ear pain or irritation\n– hearing\n– quality of life\n– any serious problems or unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics in adults and children with a long-lasting ear infection with discharge. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 15 studies that included 2371 people. The studies compared different types of antibiotics with different types of antiseptics.\n\nAntibiotic eardrops (quinolones) compared to antiseptic eardrops (boric acid)\n– Antibiotic eardrops are likely better at stopping ear discharge within two weeks compared to boric acid eardrops.\n– People using antibiotic eardrops may have less ear pain or irritation.\n– Antibiotic eardrops may slightly improve hearing more than boric acid, but this small difference may not be noticeable to the person.\n\nAntibiotic eardrops compared to other antiseptic eardrops (acetic acid or povidone-iodine)\n– We are very uncertain if there is any difference between antibiotic eardrops and these other antiseptic eardrops for stopping ear discharge. This is because the studies were very small or had problems with how they were done.\n\nNone of the studies reported on people's quality of life. Information on serious problems or other unwanted effects was very limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for most of the treatments we looked at.\n\nMany of the studies were small, and some had problems in how they were carried out, which could affect the results. The studies also did not provide enough information about unwanted effects, so we know very little about the potential harms of the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
