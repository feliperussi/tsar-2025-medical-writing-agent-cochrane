    "output": "Medicines for Ménière’s disease: do they help with vertigo and other symptoms?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Ménière’s disease is a long-term condition of the inner ear that causes sudden attacks of vertigo (a spinning feeling), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n\n– We looked at studies of medicines that affect the whole body, such as betahistine, diuretics (water pills), antivirals, and corticosteroids (steroids), to see if they help people with Ménière’s disease.\n\n– We do not know if these medicines help to improve symptoms or if they cause harm. This is because there were not enough studies, and the studies we found were small and not well-designed. More research is needed to understand if these treatments are helpful.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease?\n\nMénière’s disease is a long-term condition that affects the inner ear. It causes sudden attacks of vertigo, which is a severe spinning or dizzy feeling. These attacks can also cause nausea and vomiting.\n\nPeople with Ménière’s disease may also have other symptoms, such as:\n– hearing loss that can come and go\n– tinnitus (a ringing, buzzing, or roaring sound in the ears)\n– a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear\n\nThe cause of Ménière’s disease is not known.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if medicines that travel through the bloodstream to affect the whole body can help people with Ménière’s disease. We looked at medicines like betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids.\n\nWe were most interested in finding out if these medicines:\n– improved vertigo\n– caused any serious unwanted effects\n\nWe also looked at whether the medicines changed people's quality of life, hearing, or tinnitus.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these medicines with a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment in adults with Ménière’s disease.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 10 studies that included a total of 848 people with Ménière’s disease. The studies looked at four types of medicine: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids.\n\nThe studies were all very different from each other. They measured symptoms in different ways and followed people for different lengths of time. Because of these differences, we could not combine the results to get a clear answer.\n\nFor all the medicines studied, we could not tell if they improved vertigo or other symptoms of Ménière’s disease compared to a placebo or no treatment. Most studies did not report on serious unwanted effects, so we do not know about the risks of these treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because there were only a few studies for each medicine, and they did not include many people. There were also problems with how some of the studies were done.\n\nBecause the studies measured symptoms in different ways, it was impossible to compare their results. This means we cannot draw any firm conclusions about whether these medicines work or are safe for people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
