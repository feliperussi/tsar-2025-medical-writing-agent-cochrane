    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nAdding an ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening: does it help?\n\nKey Messages\n– For women at average risk of breast cancer, having an ultrasound scan as well as a mammogram can find more breast cancers than having a mammogram alone. The cancers found with this combined method are also less likely to have spread.\n\n– However, adding an ultrasound to a mammogram also leads to more \"false alarms.\" This is when a test suggests cancer might be present, but it is not. These false alarms lead to more women needing extra tests, like a biopsy (where a small piece of tissue is removed to be checked for cancer cells), even though they do not have cancer.\n\n– We do not know if finding more cancers by adding an ultrasound helps women live longer, because the studies did not look at this.\n\nWhat is breast cancer screening?\nBreast cancer screening aims to find cancer early, before any symptoms appear. Finding cancer early can make it easier to treat.\n\nThe most common screening test is a mammogram, which is a special X-ray of the breast. Sometimes, an ultrasound scan is also used. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of the breast.\n\nSome women have \"dense\" breast tissue, which has less fat and more connective and glandular tissue. Dense breasts can make it harder to see cancer on a mammogram.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding an ultrasound to a mammogram was better than a mammogram alone for breast cancer screening. We looked at this for women who have an average risk of getting breast cancer.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how many breast cancers were found\n– how many women died from breast cancer or any other cause\n– how many cancers were found in the time between regular screenings\n– unwanted effects, like being told you might have cancer when you do not (a \"false-positive\" result) or needing a biopsy when you do not have cancer.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using a mammogram plus an ultrasound with using a mammogram alone for breast cancer screening. The studies had to include women between 40 and 75 years old who were at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how large they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included about 209,000 women. The studies followed the women for 1 to 3 years.\n\nOur main findings came from one large, well-done study. The other studies supported these findings.\n\nFinding more cancers\nAdding an ultrasound to a mammogram found more breast cancers than a mammogram alone. The cancers found with the combined screening were also less likely to have spread to the lymph nodes (glands near the breast). Also, fewer cancers were found in the time between scheduled screenings when women had both tests.\n\nDownsides of adding an ultrasound\nThe combined screening method led to more false alarms. This means more women were told they might have cancer when they did not. Because of this, more women who did not have cancer ended up having a biopsy.\n\nWhat we still don't know\nNone of the studies we found looked at whether adding an ultrasound to screening helped women live longer.\n\nResults for women with dense breasts\nFor women with dense breasts, adding an ultrasound also helped find more cancers. The evidence was less clear for women who did not have dense breasts.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that adding an ultrasound to a mammogram finds more cancers but also causes more false alarms and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nHowever, the biggest limitation is that we do not know the long-term effects. The studies were not long enough to tell us if finding these extra cancers actually saves lives. We need longer studies to understand if this screening approach reduces deaths from breast cancer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021."
