    "output": "Can local health workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in lower-income countries?\n\nKey Messages\n\n– Programs run by local health workers (like community health workers or primary care staff) may help improve mental well-being and reduce symptoms of mental health conditions for both adults and children in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n– These programs may help reduce symptoms of common conditions like depression, anxiety, and stress. They may also help people function better in their daily lives.\n\n– We are not very confident in these results. This is because of problems with how some of the studies were done and because the studies were very different from one another. More research is needed to be sure of these effects.\n\nWhat is mental well-being and what are mental health conditions?\n\nMental health is an important part of our overall health. It includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Good mental health helps us cope with stress, have healthy relationships, and make good decisions.\n\nMental health conditions, like depression or anxiety, can change how a person thinks, feels, or acts. These changes can make it hard to cope with daily life. In many low- and middle-income countries, it can be difficult to get help for mental health problems. This is often because there are not enough trained specialists, and people may worry about being treated differently if they seek help.\n\nOne way to provide more support is to train local health workers to deliver programs that promote mental well-being and prevent mental health conditions.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if programs delivered by local health workers could help prevent mental health conditions and improve mental well-being in adults and children living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nWe looked at how these programs affected:\n– symptoms of depression\n– symptoms of anxiety\n– symptoms of stress or trauma\n– a person’s ability to function in daily life\n– a person’s quality of life\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared programs run by local health workers with usual care or no program. The people in the studies were adults and children living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe programs were designed for different groups:\n– for everyone in a community\n– for people at higher risk of developing a mental health condition\n– for people who were already showing early signs of a mental health condition\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 113 studies that included a total of 32,992 people.\n\nFor adults, the programs delivered by local health workers may have slightly reduced symptoms of anxiety and stress. For adults at higher risk of mental health problems, the programs likely reduced symptoms of depression. For adults with early signs of a condition, the programs likely helped them function better in their daily lives.\n\nFor children, the programs may have improved their quality of life and slightly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children at higher risk, the programs likely reduced symptoms of depression and stress. For children with early signs of a condition, the programs helped them function better and reduced their depression symptoms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, we had concerns about how some of the studies were done. For example, in some studies, people knew which program they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Some studies also did not report on all the people who started them, which makes the results less reliable.\n\nSecond, the studies were very different from each other. They used different types of programs and included different groups of people. This made it difficult to combine their results to get a clear answer.\n\nBecause of these issues, future research could lead to different conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021."
