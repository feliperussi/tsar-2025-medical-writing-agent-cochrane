    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan education support services help children and teenagers with long-term health conditions at school?\n\nKey Messages\n– We are very uncertain if education support services help children and teenagers with long-term health conditions (illnesses that last for a long time) to stay engaged with school or do better in their schoolwork.\n– Education support may slightly improve a child's mental health, for example, by improving their self-esteem.\n– There is very little research on this topic, so we need more and better studies to be sure about the effects of these services.\n\nWhat is a long-term health condition in children and teenagers?\nA long-term (or chronic) health condition is an illness that lasts for a long time. It usually cannot be cured completely and does not go away on its own.\n\nHaving a long-term health condition can mean a child or teenager misses a lot of school. This can make it hard for them to keep up with their learning and stay connected with friends. When children miss school, it can affect their grades, their well-being, and their future career choices.\n\nEducation support services are designed to help children with long-term health conditions stay connected to their school and their learning, especially when they have to be away due to their illness.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education support services help children and teenagers (aged 4 to 18) with long-term health conditions.\n\nWe were interested in how these services affected:\n– staying engaged with school\n– doing better in schoolwork\n– mental health and well-being\n– returning to school more easily after being away\n\nWe also wanted to know if there were any unwanted effects from these services.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at education support services for children and teenagers with long-term health conditions. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies with a total of 359 children and teenagers. Three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition that affects concentration and behavior.\n\nSchool engagement\nThe results suggested that education support might help children stay engaged with school.\n\nSchoolwork\nThe results for schoolwork were mixed. One study suggested it helped, while another suggested it did not. Because of this, we do not know if these services improve schoolwork.\n\nMental health\nThere was some evidence that education support may slightly improve children's mental health, such as their self-esteem.\n\nReturning to school\nWe are uncertain if these services help children return to school more easily after being away for their health.\n\nUnwanted effects\nNone of the studies looked at the children's overall quality of life or any unwanted effects of the support services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the results.\n\nThis is because we found only a few small studies. There were also some problems with how the studies were done, which could make the results less reliable.\n\nBecause the studies only included children with cancer or ADHD, we do not know if the results would be the same for children with other long-term health conditions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021."
