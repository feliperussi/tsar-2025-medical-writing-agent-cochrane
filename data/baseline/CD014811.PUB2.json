    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nGiving diuretics for sudden heart failure: as a continuous drip or as separate injections?\n\nKey Messages\n– Acute heart failure is a condition where the heart suddenly cannot pump blood well, causing fluid to build up in the body. It is often treated with diuretics (medicines that help the body get rid of extra fluid) given through a vein.\n– We do not know if it is better to give diuretics as a continuous drip over a long time or as separate, single injections.\n– The available evidence is not strong enough to show that one method is better than the other for helping people lose fluid weight, leave the hospital sooner, or avoid kidney problems or death.\n\nWhat is acute heart failure?\nHeart failure is a long-term condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. Acute heart failure is when symptoms of heart failure suddenly get worse.\n\nThis can cause fluid to build up in the lungs and other parts of the body, like the legs and stomach. This fluid buildup is called congestion. Common symptoms include severe shortness of breath, coughing, and swelling. People with acute heart failure usually need urgent treatment in a hospital.\n\nHow is acute heart failure treated?\nA main treatment for acute heart failure is a type of medicine called a loop diuretic. These are powerful \"water pills\" that help the kidneys remove extra salt and water from the body. This reduces fluid buildup and makes it easier for the heart to pump.\n\nIn the hospital, these medicines are usually given directly into a vein (intravenously). This can be done in two ways:\n– as a continuous drip (infusion), where the medicine flows in slowly over several hours.\n– as separate injections (boluses), where the full dose is given all at once, a few times a day.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving diuretics as a continuous drip is better or worse than giving them as separate injections for adults with acute heart failure.\n\nWe were interested in how each method affected:\n– weight loss (as a sign of fluid loss)\n– how many people died from any cause\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– how many people had to return to the hospital after going home\n– unwanted effects, especially kidney problems\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving diuretics as a continuous drip with giving them as separate injections in adults hospitalized for acute heart failure.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that included 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies took place in hospitals in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– Weight loss: Giving diuretics as a continuous drip may help people lose slightly more weight from fluid than separate injections, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n– Death: There was probably little to no difference in the number of people who died between the two groups.\n– Length of hospital stay and readmission: There was probably little to no difference in how long people stayed in the hospital or whether they had to come back to the hospital after being sent home.\n– Kidney problems: Both ways of giving the medicine seemed to have a similar risk of causing kidney problems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because most of the studies we found were small. Some also had problems in how they were designed or carried out, which could make their results less reliable.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure which way of giving diuretics is better. More and better-quality research is needed to answer this question clearly.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
