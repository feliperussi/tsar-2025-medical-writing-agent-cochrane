    "output": "Medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis: what are the benefits and harms?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment), corticosteroid medicines probably improve symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and greatly reduce inflammation in the esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach).\n\n– Compared to a placebo, biologic medicines also reduce inflammation in the esophagus. However, we are less certain if they improve symptoms.\n\n– Fewer people may stop taking corticosteroids due to unwanted effects compared to those taking a placebo. For biologics, there may be no difference in the number of people who stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE, is a long-term condition that affects the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\n\nIn people with EoE, a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the esophagus. This is usually caused by an immune system reaction to certain foods. The build-up of these cells causes swelling and inflammation, which can make it difficult and painful to swallow. People with EoE may feel like food is getting stuck in their throat.\n\nHow is EoE treated?\n\nThere is no cure for EoE, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and reduce inflammation. The main treatments are:\n\n– special diets that avoid foods that trigger the condition\n– procedures to gently stretch the esophagus if it has become too narrow\n– medicines, such as corticosteroids and biologics\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work for people with EoE and if they cause any unwanted effects.\n\nWe were interested in how the medicines affected:\n\n– symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing\n– inflammation in the esophagus, which is seen by looking at a tissue sample under a microscope\n– the appearance of the esophagus, which is seen during a camera test (an endoscopy)\n– any unwanted effects that caused people to stop their treatment\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medicines with a placebo or another treatment in people with EoE.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 41 studies that included 3253 people with EoE. Most studies looked at people whose condition was active.\n\nThis summary focuses on the two main types of medicine compared with a placebo: corticosteroids and biologics.\n\nCorticosteroids compared to a placebo\n\n– People who took corticosteroids were more likely to report that their symptoms improved.\n\n– Corticosteroids greatly reduced the inflammation and the number of eosinophils in the esophagus.\n\n– We are not sure if corticosteroids improved how the esophagus looked during a camera test. The evidence was not clear.\n\n– Fewer people stopped taking corticosteroids because of unwanted effects than those who took the placebo.\n\nBiologics compared to a placebo\n\n– The evidence was mixed on whether biologics improved symptoms. Some studies suggested a small benefit, while others found no difference.\n\n– Biologics reduced the inflammation and the number of eosinophils in the esophagus.\n\n– We do not have enough information to know if biologics improved how the esophagus looked.\n\n– There was probably no difference in the number of people who stopped taking biologics due to unwanted effects compared to those who took the placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nFor many of our questions, we are not very confident in the results. This is because some studies were small.\n\nAlso, the studies often measured people's improvement in different ways. This made it difficult to combine the results and be certain about the findings. More research is needed to be more certain about the benefits and harms of these medicines for EoE.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
