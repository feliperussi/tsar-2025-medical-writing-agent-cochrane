    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat helps to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care?\n\nKey Messages\n– Physical restraints are things like belts or bedrails used to limit a person's movement. Care home-wide programs that include staff training, new policies, and support for staff probably help reduce how often restraints are used, especially belts.\n– We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff, without other support, help to reduce the use of restraints.\n– All the studies we found were in care homes. This means we do not know what works for older people who receive care in their own homes.\n\nWhat are physical restraints in long-term care?\nPhysical restraints are devices used to stop a person from moving freely. Examples include belts that hold someone in a chair or bed, and rails on the side of a bed. They are often used in care homes for older people, with the goal of preventing falls and injuries.\n\nHowever, studies show that using restraints does not always work and can sometimes cause harm, such as serious injuries, distress, and confusion. For these reasons, experts recommend that physical restraints should be avoided whenever possible.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what types of programs or approaches are best for preventing or reducing the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care.\n\nWe were interested in how these approaches affected:\n– the number of people being restrained\n– any serious harm caused by the restraints, such as injuries or death\n– the number of falls or injuries from falls\n– feelings of agitation (restlessness or worry)\n– a person's quality of life\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested different ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people living in care homes or in their own homes.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 19,003 older people. The average age of the people in the studies was 85. All studies took place in care homes, and all of them included people with dementia (a condition that affects memory and thinking).\n\nThe studies looked at three main types of approaches:\n\n1. Care home-wide programs to create a \"least-restraint\" policy\nThese programs involved several parts, such as educating staff, training special \"champions\" to promote using fewer restraints, and changing the care home's overall policies. We found that these programs probably reduce the number of residents who are restrained. They also probably lead to a large reduction in the use of belts for restraint. These programs may have little or no effect on the number of falls or fall-related injuries.\n\n2. Simple educational programs for staff\nThese programs focused only on giving staff information to increase their knowledge and change their attitudes about using restraints. The results from these studies were unclear and inconsistent. Because of this, we are very uncertain if simple education on its own helps to reduce the use of restraints.\n\n3. Providing staff with information about residents' fall risk\nOne study tested whether giving staff specific information about which residents were most likely to fall would change how often they used restraints. This approach may make little or no difference to the use of restraints.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. There were some problems with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. For the simple educational programs, the results were very mixed, which makes it hard to be sure about their effects.\n\nAlso, all the studies were conducted in care homes. This means we cannot be sure if the findings apply to older people who receive long-term care in their own homes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
