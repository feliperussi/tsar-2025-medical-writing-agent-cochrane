    "output": "How can eye tests and glasses be provided in local communities?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Refractive error is a common eye problem that causes blurry vision, but it can usually be fixed with glasses. We looked for all the different ways that eye tests and glasses are provided to people in their local communities.\n\n– Eye care services can be delivered in many places, such as in schools, at local pharmacies, in special vision centres, or through mobile clinics that travel to different areas.\n\n– Although many different methods for providing eye care exist, we found very little information on how well these methods work. More research is needed to understand which approaches are best for helping people get the eye care they need.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error?\n\nUncorrected refractive error is a very common eye condition that makes vision blurry. It happens when the shape of your eye stops light from focusing correctly, making it hard to see things clearly.\n\nFor most people, this problem can be easily corrected by wearing the right pair of glasses. When people cannot get the glasses they need, it is called 'uncorrected refractive error'. This is one of the main reasons people have vision problems around the world.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out all the different ways that eye care services, like eye tests and providing glasses, are delivered to people in their local communities or at primary health clinics.\n\nWe also wanted to see if these different ways of providing care had been studied to find out how well they work.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies and reports published between 2002 and 2022. We looked in medical databases and also searched for reports from companies and organizations that provide eye care.\n\nWe collected information on all the different approaches we could find. We then grouped them together and described them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found over 400 studies and reports that described different ways of providing eye care. We found that eye care services were often delivered in two main settings:\n\n– In the community: This included providing eye tests and glasses at schools, in local pharmacies, or through mobile clinics (called outreach services) that travel to different places.\n\n– In primary care clinics: This included special vision centres, general health clinics, or a mix of clinic appointments and home visits.\n\nThe most common approaches were providing care in schools, using mobile clinics, and setting up special vision centres.\n\nHowever, we found a major gap. Very few of the reports we looked at had actually studied how well their approach worked. This means we do not know much about which methods are most effective at getting glasses to the people who need them.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe main limitation is in the information that was available for us to review. Most of the reports described a way of providing eye care but did not include studies to see if it was a good way.\n\nBecause of this, we can describe many different approaches, but we cannot say which ones work best, are most affordable, or are easiest for people to use. More research is needed to compare these different methods.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022."
