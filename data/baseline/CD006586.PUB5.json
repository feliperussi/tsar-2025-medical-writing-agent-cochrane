    "output": "Do birth control pills with drospirenone help with premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For women with a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), birth control pills containing the hormone drospirenone may slightly improve symptoms. They may also reduce how much symptoms affect daily life, such as work, social activities, and relationships, when compared to a dummy pill (placebo).\n\n– However, these birth control pills may also cause more unwanted side effects, like breast pain, feeling sick, and bleeding between periods. More women stopped taking them because of side effects compared to women who took the dummy pill.\n\n– We are not very confident in these results because of problems with how the studies were done. We do not know if these pills work for longer than three months, help women with milder PMS, or are better than other types of birth control pills.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?\n\nPremenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a group of physical and emotional symptoms that many women get in the days or weeks before their monthly period. Symptoms can include mood swings, feeling irritable, bloating, and breast tenderness.\n\nFor some women, these symptoms can be very severe and interfere with their daily lives and relationships. This severe form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if combined birth control pills containing a hormone called drospirenone help women with PMS. These pills also contain a low dose of another hormone called oestrogen.\n\nWe were interested in how these pills affected:\n– overall PMS symptoms\n– how symptoms affected daily life (work, social life, and relationships)\n– unwanted side effects\n– how many women stopped taking the pills because of side effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at birth control pills containing drospirenone compared with a dummy pill (placebo) in women with PMS. A dummy pill looks like the real medicine but has no active ingredients.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 5 studies that included 858 women. Most of the women in the studies had the severe form of PMS called PMDD. The studies lasted for about three months.\n\nCompared to a dummy pill, birth control pills with drospirenone may slightly improve overall PMS symptoms. They may also help reduce the problems that symptoms cause with work, social activities, and relationships. Women who took the dummy pill also reported that their symptoms improved, but not as much.\n\nWomen taking the birth control pills with drospirenone were more likely to have side effects. These included breast pain, nausea (feeling sick), and bleeding between periods. They were also more likely to stop taking the pills because of side effects than women who took the dummy pill. We are not sure if these pills help with mood symptoms.\n\nWe did not find any studies that compared birth control pills with drospirenone to other types of birth control pills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have limited confidence in our findings. This is because there were problems with how some of the studies were done. For example, the researchers did not always clearly explain their methods. Also, the results from the different studies were not always consistent with each other.\n\nBecause the studies only lasted for about three months, we do not know if the pills continue to work or what the side effects are over a longer time. Most women in the studies had severe PMS, so we do not know if the results apply to women with milder symptoms.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
