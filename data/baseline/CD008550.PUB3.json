    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nMedicines for reflux in babies and children: do they help?\n\nKey Messages\n– Reflux, where stomach contents come back up into the food pipe, is very common in babies and usually gets better on its own as they grow.\n– For babies with reflux, we are not sure if medicines that reduce stomach acid (like omeprazole and esomeprazole) help reduce symptoms like crying or fussing any more than a dummy medicine (placebo).\n– For older children with reflux, it is also unclear if these types of medicines help with their symptoms. We have very little confidence in the current evidence and need more and better studies.\n\nWhat is reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), often just called reflux, is when the contents of the stomach, including acid, travel back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). It is very common in babies, causing them to spit up milk. For most babies, this is normal and gets better by itself over time.\n\nSometimes, reflux can cause more serious problems like pain, poor feeding, or trouble gaining weight. When this happens, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Older children can also have GORD, which might cause heartburn or other uncomfortable symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if medicines help treat reflux in babies and children up to 16 years old.\n\nSpecifically, we wanted to know if these medicines:\n– improve reflux symptoms, such as crying, fussing, or pain\n– cause any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines for reflux with either a dummy medicine (placebo) or another medicine. We looked for studies in babies and children up to 16 years old.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many children were included.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that included 2251 babies and children. However, we could only use the results from 14 of these studies because the others did not provide enough information. The studies were very different from each other, so we could not combine their results to get an overall picture.\n\nWe looked at the results for babies and older children separately.\n\nBabies (up to 12 months old)\nThe evidence suggests that medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole and esomeprazole, may not be any better than a placebo at reducing symptoms like crying or fussing. These medicines work by reducing the amount of acid in the stomach. We are not sure if one type of medicine is better than another.\n\nOlder children (1 to 16 years old)\nFor older children, the evidence also suggests that PPIs may provide little to no benefit for their reflux symptoms. We did not find enough information to draw conclusions about other types of medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because most of the studies were very small. There were also problems with how some of the studies were done, and they did not always measure the results in a consistent way.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the results. Future research is likely to change our conclusions. More and better studies are needed to understand if these medicines are helpful for children with reflux.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
