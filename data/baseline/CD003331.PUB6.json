    "output": "Can exercise programs help adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For people with heart failure, taking part in an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program (a structured program of exercise and education) likely reduces the number of times they need to be admitted to the hospital.\n\n– These programs also likely lead to important improvements in their quality of life.\n\n– We are uncertain if these exercise programs change the risk of dying within the first year.\n\nWhat is heart failure?\n\nHeart failure is a long-term condition where the heart cannot pump blood around the body as well as it should. It does not mean the heart has stopped working.\n\nThis can cause symptoms like feeling very tired, being short of breath, and having swollen legs. These symptoms can make daily activities difficult and affect a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs are helpful for adults with heart failure. Cardiac rehabilitation programs often include structured exercise as well as support for things like diet and managing stress.\n\nWe were interested in how these programs affected:\n– dying from any cause\n– being admitted to the hospital for any reason\n– being admitted to the hospital because of heart failure\n– a person's quality of life\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs with usual medical care that did not include a formal exercise program. The studies had to include adults with heart failure.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. The studies followed people for about 6 months on average, with some lasting up to a year.\n\nHospital admissions\nPeople who took part in an exercise program were less likely to be admitted to the hospital for any reason compared to those who had usual care. They were also likely to have fewer hospital stays specifically for heart failure.\n\nQuality of life\nPeople who took part in exercise programs reported a better quality of life. The improvement was large enough to be meaningful in their daily lives.\n\nRisk of dying\nWe did not find a difference in the number of people who died within the first year between those who did the exercise programs and those who did not.\n\nThe benefits of exercise programs seemed to be similar no matter how they were delivered. This includes programs at a hospital or center, programs done at home, and programs with different types of exercise.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident that exercise programs reduce hospital stays and improve quality of life.\n\nOur confidence is lower for some of the other findings. For example, we are not confident about the effect of exercise on the risk of dying. This is because of how some of the studies were designed and carried out.\n\nAlso, many of the studies included mainly men with a specific type of heart failure. More research is needed to understand the effects in women, older people, and people with other types of heart failure.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021."
