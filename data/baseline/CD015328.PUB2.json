    "output": "What helps prevent children aged 5 to 11 from developing obesity?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Programs that combine healthy eating and physical activity may lead to a small reduction in children's weight gain for up to 15 months, but the effect may not last.\n– Programs that focus only on increasing physical activity may also have a small, short-term effect on children's weight gain.\n– We are not sure if these programs have any unwanted effects, and more research is needed to know if they work for all children, such as those with disabilities.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity?\n\nChildhood obesity is a medical condition where a child has an unhealthy amount of body fat for their age and height. It happens when a child regularly takes in more energy (from food and drink) than their body uses for activity and growth.\n\nBeing overweight or having obesity as a child can lead to health problems, such as type 2 diabetes and heart conditions, both during childhood and later in life. Doctors often use a measure called Body Mass Index, or BMI, to check if a child's weight is in a healthy range for their age, sex, and height.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if programs designed to encourage healthy eating, physical activity, or both could help prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11.\n\nWe were interested in the effects of these programs on:\n– children's weight, measured using BMI\n– any serious unwanted effects of the programs\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that tested programs to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11. The programs focused on healthy eating, physical activity, or a combination of both. The studies compared these programs to children receiving no program or their usual care.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 172 studies that included a total of 189,707 children. Most of the programs took place in schools.\n\nPrograms combining healthy eating and physical activity\nThese programs may slightly reduce weight gain in children for up to 15 months. After 15 months, there may be little to no difference in weight compared to children who did not take part in a program.\n\nPrograms with only physical activity\nThese programs may also slightly reduce weight gain for up to 15 months. We found little to no difference in weight at the start of the programs or after 15 months.\n\nPrograms with only healthy eating\nThese programs may make little to no difference to children's weight at any time.\n\nUnwanted effects\nA few studies reported unwanted effects, such as minor injuries from physical activity or children developing unhealthy dieting habits. However, most studies reported no problems. We do not have enough information to be sure about the risks of these programs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were done. Also, the results from different studies were often not consistent with each other.\n\nMost studies did not include children with physical or mental disabilities, so we do not know if these programs would work for them. We also found very little information about programs that took place in the community or at home, rather than in schools.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023."
