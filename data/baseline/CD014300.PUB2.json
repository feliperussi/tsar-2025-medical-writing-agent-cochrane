    "output": "Can talking therapies and social activities improve the mental health of people affected by major crises?\n\nKey messages\n\n– People affected by major crises like wars or natural disasters often live in difficult conditions that can harm their mental health. We wanted to know if psychological and social support (like talking therapies or group activities) can help improve their well-being.\n– For children and teenagers, we are not sure if these supports help. The evidence we found suggests they may make little to no difference to their feelings of well-being or their ability to get along with others.\n– For adults, these supports might offer a small, short-term improvement in their well-being. However, this effect may not last. Overall, we need more and better research to know for sure if these supports are helpful.\n\nWhat is mental health in humanitarian crises?\n\nA humanitarian crisis happens when events like war, conflict, or natural disasters threaten the health, safety, and well-being of a large group of people. Millions of people around the world are forced to leave their homes because of these crises.\n\nLiving through a crisis is very stressful. People may lose their homes, their jobs, and their loved ones. This can have a big impact on their mental health, affecting their feelings, thoughts, and ability to cope with daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychological and social supports help improve the mental health of adults and children living through humanitarian crises in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nWe were interested in whether these supports improved things like:\n– feelings of well-being\n– ability to manage daily life (functioning)\n– quality of life\n– positive social behaviour, like being helpful to others\n\nWe also looked at how many people dropped out of the studies to see if the supports were acceptable to them.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological and social supports with either no support, usual support available in the area, or being on a waiting list for support. The people in the studies were adults and children living in areas affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 13 studies that included a total of 7917 people. Nine studies focused on children and teenagers, and four focused on adults. The supports were usually given in groups by trained local people who were not mental health professionals. The studies lasted for about 18 weeks on average.\n\nFor children and teenagers:\nWe are not sure if psychological and social supports improve their feelings of well-being or their positive social behaviour. The evidence suggests there may be little to no difference compared to receiving no support. One study suggested that these supports might help children with their daily tasks, but because this was just one study, we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nFor adults:\nPsychological and social supports may slightly improve adults' feelings of well-being right after the support ends. However, this improvement may not last over time. No studies looked at how these supports affected adults' ability to manage daily life or their positive social behaviour.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the results. This is because:\n– there were not many studies available for us to look at.\n– some of the studies were small.\n– we had concerns about the way some of the studies were carried out.\n– the results from different studies were often very different from each other, which made it hard to draw clear conclusions.\n\nBecause of these problems, we cannot be sure about the effects of these supports.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
