    "output": "Single-incision slings for treating accidental urine leakage in women\n\nKey messages\n\n– For women with accidental urine leakage, single-incision sling surgery is likely just as effective at improving leakage after one year as another common surgery called a transobturator sling. A sling is a small piece of mesh tape that a surgeon places to support the tube that carries urine out of the body.\n\n– Women who have a single-incision sling probably have less long-term pain after surgery compared to women who have a transobturator sling.\n\n– We are still uncertain about the long-term safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other types of surgery for urine leakage.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence?\n\nStress urinary incontinence is when you accidentally leak urine when your bladder is under pressure. This can happen when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exercise. It is a common condition that affects many women. It is often caused by a weakening of the muscles that support the bladder and control the release of urine.\n\nHow is stress urinary incontinence treated?\n\nTreatment often starts with simple measures like pelvic floor muscle exercises. If these do not work well enough, a doctor might suggest surgery.\n\nOne common type of surgery uses a 'sling'. This is a small piece of synthetic mesh or body tissue that the surgeon places under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra). The sling acts like a hammock to support the urethra and stop urine from leaking. There are several types of sling operations:\n\n– Single-incision slings: these are placed through one small cut inside the vagina.\n– Retropubic slings: the sling is passed behind the pubic bone.\n– Transobturator slings: the sling is passed through the inner thigh muscles.\n– Autologous fascial slings: the sling is made from the person's own body tissue instead of synthetic mesh.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how single-incision slings compare to other treatments for stress urinary incontinence in women. We were interested in both the benefits and the possible harms.\n\nWe looked at:\n– improvement in urine leakage\n– long-term pain after surgery\n– pain during sex\n– problems with the mesh sling, such as it being exposed in the vagina\n– difficulty emptying the bladder after surgery\n– quality of life\n– whether women needed another surgery for leakage or to fix a problem with the sling\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for women with stress urinary incontinence.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 62 studies that included a total of 8051 women. The studies compared single-incision slings with three other types of sling surgery.\n\nSingle-incision sling compared to retropubic sling\nThere may be little to no difference between these two surgeries in improving urine leakage after one year. We are very uncertain about how they compare for other outcomes, like the risk of mesh problems or the need for another surgery, because the studies were small.\n\nSingle-incision sling compared to transobturator sling\nThis was the most common comparison. We are confident that there is no difference between these two surgeries in improving urine leakage after one year.\n\nWomen who had a single-incision sling probably had less long-term pain (lasting 2 years or more) after their operation. There was probably little to no difference between the groups in the number of women who had problems with the mesh or had difficulty emptying their bladder.\n\nIt is not clear if one surgery is better than the other for preventing pain during sex. Women who had single-incision slings may have had a slightly lower quality of life after 12 months. It is also unclear if single-incision slings lead to more women needing another surgery later on.\n\nSingle-incision sling compared to autologous fascial sling (using the body's own tissue)\nOnly one very small study made this comparison. Because of this, we are very uncertain about the benefits and risks of single-incision slings compared to slings made from a woman's own tissue.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence varied. For the main comparison between single-incision and transobturator slings, we are confident about the short-term improvement in leakage.\n\nHowever, for many other outcomes, especially long-term problems, our confidence is lower. This is because some studies were not done very well, the results were not consistent across studies, or there was not enough information to be certain. We need more long-term research to better understand the safety of single-incision slings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
