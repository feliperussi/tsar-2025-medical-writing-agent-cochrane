    "output": "Using personal mobile phones for work: what are the benefits and risks for healthcare workers?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Healthcare workers often use their own mobile phones for work to fill gaps when their workplace does not provide the right tools. This can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs.\n\n– However, using personal phones can create problems for healthcare workers. It can cost them money, blur the line between work and home life, and create unfairness between staff members.\n\n– Using personal phones for work can also create risks for patients, such as breaking the privacy of their health information. It can also weaken the overall healthcare system by keeping important information out of official records.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers use their personal phones for work?\n\nSometimes, hospitals and clinics do not have good systems for staff to communicate quickly or access information easily. To solve these problems, healthcare workers often find their own solutions.\n\nOne common solution is to use their personal mobile phones to call colleagues, message patients, or look up information. This use is often informal, meaning it is not regulated or supported by their employer. This review looks at the good and bad sides of this practice.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of healthcare workers who use their own mobile phones or other devices for their jobs.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– why they use their personal devices\n– the good things that happen when they do\n– the problems or challenges it causes for them, their patients, and the healthcare system\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that explored the views and experiences of healthcare workers using their personal mobile devices for work. We included studies from all over the world. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 30 studies. The studies showed that healthcare workers often feel there is a gap between what their job asks of them and the tools they are given to do it. To fill this gap, they use their own resources. This includes their personal mobile phones, data plans, and their own time outside of work hours.\n\nIn some places, using personal phones has become a normal part of the job, and workers feel pressure from managers and colleagues to do so.\n\nBenefits of using personal phones\nUsing personal phones can help healthcare workers be more flexible, quick, and caring. It can help them:\n– build stronger, more personal relationships with patients and colleagues.\n– give patients a direct way to contact them instead of going through a general system.\n– sometimes keep a patient's private information out of the official records if the patient wishes.\n\nProblems for healthcare workers\nHowever, this informal system also causes problems.\n– It costs healthcare workers their own money for calls and data. This is especially hard for staff who are paid less.\n– It can create pressure to be available for work calls even when at home.\n– It can lead to unfairness. For example, workers with better personal networks or more money for data might be able to do more than others.\n\nProblems for patients and the health system\nUsing personal phones can also create risks for patients.\n– When patient information is stored or shared on a personal phone, it might not be secure, and privacy could be lost.\n– Healthcare workers might choose to use their personal resources to help patients they feel are most in need. This could lead to some patients getting more help than others based on a worker's personal judgment.\n\nFinally, while these informal solutions plug gaps, they can also weaken the healthcare system. Important information about patients or supplies might be shared on personal phones and never get recorded in the official system. This creates a \"shadow\" information system that managers cannot see. It can also lead to more distractions at work from personal calls or social media.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are confident in the main findings of this review. The experiences described came from 30 different studies in many types of healthcare settings. However, the experiences of healthcare workers can vary a lot depending on their specific job, workplace, and country. The findings may not apply to all situations.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
