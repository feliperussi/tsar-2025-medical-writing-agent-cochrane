    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nUsing a lung scope (bronchoscopy) to guide antibiotic treatment for lung infections in children with cystic fibrosis\n\nKey Messages\n– For children with cystic fibrosis (CF), doctors sometimes use a special thin tube with a camera, called a bronchoscope, to look inside the lungs and take samples. This helps them choose the right antibiotic medicine for a lung infection. This is compared to the standard way of choosing antibiotics, which uses samples from a throat swab or is based on a child's symptoms.\n\n– We found that for children with CF, choosing antibiotics based on samples from a lung scope probably does not improve lung health or quality of life compared to standard care. It may lead to more hospital stays.\n\n– The evidence we found is only for infants and children. We do not know if using a lung scope to guide treatment is helpful for adults with CF.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis?\nCystic fibrosis, or CF, is a condition that people are born with. It causes the body to make very thick, sticky mucus. This mucus can build up in different parts of thebody, especially the lungs.\n\nThe thick mucus in the lungs can trap germs, which can lead to repeated lung infections. These infections can damage the lungs over time. Treating lung infections early and with the right medicines is a very important part of care for people with CF.\n\nHow are lung infections in cystic fibrosis treated?\nTo treat a lung infection, doctors need to know which germs are causing it so they can choose the best antibiotic medicine.\n\nUsually, doctors collect a sample of mucus from a person's throat or from what they cough up. But sometimes, especially in young children who cannot cough up mucus, these samples may not show the germs that are deeper in the lungs.\n\nAnother way to get a sample is with a procedure called a bronchoscopy. A doctor guides a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera through the nose or mouth and down into the lungs. They can then collect a sample of fluid from deep inside the lungs. This is called a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if choosing antibiotics based on samples from a bronchoscopy is better for children with CF than choosing them based on standard care (like throat swabs and symptoms).\n\nWe were interested in how these two approaches affected:\n– lung function (how well the lungs work)\n– lung damage seen on scans\n– how many times a child had to stay in the hospital\n– nutrition and growth\n– quality of life\n– any unwanted effects from the bronchoscopy procedure\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment with using standard care in children and adults with CF.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 187 infants and children with CF. One study followed infants until they were 5 years old. The other study included children aged 5 to 18.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– Lung function and lung damage: Using bronchoscopy to guide treatment probably makes little or no difference to how well the lungs work or to the amount of lung damage seen on scans compared to standard care.\n\n– Hospital stays: Children whose treatment was guided by bronchoscopy may have had more hospital stays.\n\n– Infections: There was likely little or no difference in the number of lung infections caused by a common germ called *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.\n\n– Cost of care: The total cost of medical care was probably about the same for both groups.\n\n– Unwanted effects: The bronchoscopy procedure was generally safe. The most common side effect was a cough that got worse for a short time. In rare cases, more serious problems happened during or right after the procedure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because we only found two studies. Also, the studies measured health outcomes in different ways, so we could not combine their results.\n\nFor some outcomes, we are not very confident in the results. Future research could lead to different conclusions. The evidence we found only applies to children, so we cannot say anything about using this procedure in adults with CF.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023."
