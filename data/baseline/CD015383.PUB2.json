    "output": "Can therapy with psychedelic medicines help people with life-threatening diseases who have anxiety or depression?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For people with life-threatening diseases, therapy that includes psychedelic medicines like psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') or LSD may help reduce anxiety and depression.\n\n– We are not very confident in these results. The studies were small, and it was easy for people to know if they had received the real medicine or a placebo (a dummy treatment), which could have affected the results.\n\n– No serious unwanted effects were reported in the studies. Some people had temporary problems like high blood pressure, feeling sick, or anxiety. These problems went away when the medicine wore off.\n\nWhat are the challenges of having a life-threatening disease?\n\nBeing diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, such as cancer, can be very difficult. It is common for people to experience strong emotions like anxiety, depression, and fear.\n\nSome people also experience 'existential distress'. This means they may struggle with feelings of hopelessness, a loss of meaning in their life, or fear about death. These feelings can have a big impact on a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy?\n\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment where a person takes a psychedelic medicine under the supervision of trained health professionals, like doctors or psychologists. The treatment also includes therapy sessions before and after taking the medicine to help the person prepare for and understand their experience.\n\nIt is important to know that these medicines are illegal in most countries and can have risks if used without medical supervision.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychedelic-assisted therapy helps people with life-threatening diseases who are experiencing anxiety, depression, or existential distress.\n\nWe looked at how this therapy compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medicines. We were interested in its effects on:\n\n– anxiety\n– depression\n– existential distress (feelings of hopelessness or loss of meaning)\n– quality of life\n– feelings of spirituality\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at psychedelic-assisted therapy compared with a placebo in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 140 people. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months.\n\nThe studies looked at therapy using two types of psychedelic medicines:\n– psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') or LSD\n– MDMA ('Ecstasy')\n\nTherapy with psilocybin or LSD\nThis type of therapy may reduce anxiety and depression in people with life-threatening diseases. It may also help with feelings of hopelessness, but we are very unsure about this finding.\n\nTherapy with MDMA\nWe are very unsure if therapy with MDMA helps with anxiety or depression.\n\nUnwanted effects\nNo serious unwanted effects were reported in any of the studies.\n\nThe most common unwanted effects were temporary and not severe. For psilocybin and LSD, these included high blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. For MDMA, these included anxiety, dry mouth, and jaw clenching. These problems usually went away within a day.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is low. This is for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, there were problems with how the studies were done. It is very difficult to hide who is getting a psychedelic medicine. People in the studies could easily guess if they had received the real medicine or a placebo. This knowledge could have affected how they reported their feelings.\n\nSecond, the studies were very small. This makes the results less reliable. Because of these issues, future research might find different results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
