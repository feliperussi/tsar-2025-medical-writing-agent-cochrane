    "output": "Does lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina improve vision?\n\nKey messages\n\n– A detached retina is an eye emergency where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away. It is often treated with surgery that uses a gas bubble to hold the retina in place while it heals.\n– After surgery, some people are asked to lie face-down to help the eye heal. We looked at studies to see if this helps.\n– Lying face-down may reduce the risk of the retina shifting after surgery and may prevent some vision problems like double vision. However, it may also increase the pressure inside the eye. We are not confident in these results, and more research is needed.\n\nWhat is a detached retina?\n\nThe retina is a thin layer of tissue at the back of your eye that senses light and sends signals to your brain. This is how you see. A detached retina is when this layer pulls away from its normal position.\n\nWhen the detachment affects the central part of the retina, called the macula, it is a serious emergency. The macula is responsible for your sharp, detailed vision used for reading and recognizing faces. A detached retina can cause blurry vision, flashes of light, or a dark shadow over your vision.\n\nHow is a detached retina treated?\n\nA detached retina is usually treated with surgery. One common type of surgery involves removing the jelly-like substance inside the eye and replacing it with a gas bubble. This bubble pushes the retina back into place so it can heal.\n\nAfter the surgery, doctors may ask you to keep your head in a certain position for a while, such as face-down. This helps the gas bubble stay in the right place to support the retina.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina is better than lying in other positions or not having a specific position at all.\n\nWe were interested in how lying face-down affected:\n– the retina shifting out of place after healing\n– how clearly people could see\n– whether people had distorted vision (when straight lines look wavy)\n– people's quality of life\n– any unwanted effects, such as double vision or high pressure inside the eye.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared lying face-down with other positions (like lying face-up or on your side) for people who had surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 3 studies that included 368 people with a detached retina.\n\nThe studies showed that compared to other positions, lying face-down after surgery may:\n– reduce the chance of the retina shifting slightly after it has been reattached.\n– reduce the risk of developing wrinkles in the retina.\n– reduce the risk of having double vision.\n\nHowever, lying face-down may also increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye, which can be harmful.\n\nWe found no clear difference between the positions for how clearly people could see or whether they had distorted vision.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not very confident in these results. This is because the studies we found were small, and there were some issues with how they were carried out.\n\nBecause the evidence is not strong, we cannot be sure about the benefits and risks of lying face-down after this type of eye surgery. The results could change when more research is done.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022."
