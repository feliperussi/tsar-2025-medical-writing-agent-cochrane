    "output": "Which surgery is better for treating kidney stones in adults: PCNL or RIRS?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For adults with kidney stones, a surgery called percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), where a surgeon makes a small cut in the back to reach the kidney, may be better at removing all the stone pieces than a surgery called retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), where a surgeon uses a thin camera passed up through the body's natural urinary tubes.\n\n– People who have PCNL may also be less likely to need a second surgery to remove leftover stones.\n\n– PCNL probably makes little to no difference in the risk of serious problems compared to RIRS, but it may mean staying in the hospital for about one day longer. Our confidence in these results is limited because of how the studies were done.\n\nWhat are kidney stones?\n\nKidney stones are hard, pebble-like pieces of material that form in one or both kidneys when there are high levels of certain minerals in the urine. They can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball.\n\nWhile small stones may pass out of the body in the urine without causing problems, larger stones can get stuck. This can block the flow of urine and cause severe pain, bleeding, or infections.\n\nHow are kidney stones treated?\n\nThere are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and where they are located. This review looked at two types of surgery for larger stones inside the kidney.\n\n– Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): For this surgery, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back. They then create a narrow tunnel directly into the kidney and use special instruments to break up and remove the stone.\n\n– Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS): For this surgery, a surgeon passes a very thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end (a scope) through the body's natural urinary opening. They guide the scope up to the kidney and use a laser to break the stone into tiny pieces. These small pieces can then pass out of the body in the urine.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which surgery, PCNL or RIRS, is better and safer for treating kidney stones in adults.\n\nWe were interested in several things, including:\n– how well each surgery cleared all the stones\n– the risk of serious problems or unwanted effects\n– whether people needed another surgery later\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– damage to the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder)\n– people's quality of life after surgery\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults with kidney stones. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 42 studies that included 4571 adults with kidney stones.\n\nCompared with RIRS, PCNL may be better at getting rid of all the stone pieces. People who had PCNL may also be less likely to need a second surgery.\n\nPCNL probably makes little to no difference in the risk of having a serious problem during or after surgery. It also may not affect the risk of damage to the ureter. However, people who had PCNL may stay in the hospital for about one day longer than people who had RIRS.\n\nThe studies did not give us any information about how the surgeries affected people's quality of life or whether they needed unplanned visits to a doctor or hospital after going home.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. This is because many of the studies we found had problems in how they were designed and carried out. For example, some studies were very small. This means we cannot be certain about the results, and future research might lead to different conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
