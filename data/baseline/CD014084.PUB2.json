    "output": "Is surgery helpful for nose and sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Cystic fibrosis can cause long-term swelling in the nose and sinuses, leading to soft growths called nasal polyps. We wanted to know if surgery to remove these polyps is better than medical treatment alone.\n\n– We are very uncertain about the effects of surgery for nasal polyps in people with cystic fibrosis. This is because we found only one small study.\n\n– We do not know if surgery improves nose symptoms, lung health, or reduces the need for antibiotics compared to medical treatment alone. More and better research is needed to answer this question.\n\nWhat are cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps?\n\nCystic fibrosis is a condition people are born with that affects the whole body. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in organs like the lungs and sinuses.\n\nThis sticky mucus can block the sinuses, which are small, air-filled spaces behind the cheekbones and forehead. This blockage can lead to long-term swelling and irritation, a condition called chronic rhinosinusitis. Sometimes, this irritation causes soft, non-cancerous growths called nasal polyps to form inside the nose and sinuses. These polyps can make it hard to breathe through the nose and can affect a person's sense of smell.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if surgery to remove nasal polyps is better than medical treatment alone for people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWe were interested in how surgery affected:\n– nose and sinus symptoms\n– lung health and breathing\n– the number of lung infections\n– the need for antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections)\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared people with cystic fibrosis who had surgery for nasal polyps with people who only had medical treatment. Medical treatment usually involves washing out the nose with a salt-water solution.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies we found. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found only one study that was suitable for our review. The study included 28 people with cystic fibrosis, aged 19 to 28. Half of the people had surgery to remove their polyps plus daily nose washing. The other half only had daily nose washing.\n\nBecause there was only one small study, we are very uncertain about the results. We do not know if adding surgery to medical treatment helps to:\n– improve nose symptoms\n– improve lung health\n– reduce the number of lung infections\n– reduce the need for antibiotics\n\nThe study reported one person had bleeding during surgery, but this was stopped during the operation and caused no further problems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low. This is mainly because our findings are based on only one very small study. We cannot be sure that the results are reliable. We need more and larger studies to understand the true benefits and risks of surgery for nasal polyps in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
