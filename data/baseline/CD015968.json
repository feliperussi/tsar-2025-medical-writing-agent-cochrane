    "output": "Can digital health tools help children and adolescents manage obesity?\n\nKey messages\n\n– When used with usual care from a healthcare professional (like advice on diet and exercise), digital health tools may slightly reduce body fat in children and adolescents over a few months. Digital health tools include things like websites, phone apps, and active video games.\n\n– We do not know if using digital health tools on their own, without support from a healthcare professional, helps to manage obesity.\n\n– We are not sure about the long-term effects of these tools, and the studies we found did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity?\n\nChildhood obesity is a health condition where a child or teenager has an unhealthy amount of body fat for their height and age. It is a growing problem around the world.\n\nHaving obesity in childhood can increase the risk of developing long-term health problems later in life, such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\nWhat are digital health tools?\n\nDigital health tools use technology to help people manage their health. For managing obesity, these tools can include:\n\n– websites with health information\n– mobile phone or tablet apps to track food or activity\n– text messages with reminders and tips\n– active video games (sometimes called 'exergaming') that encourage movement\n\nThese tools are often used alongside usual care, which includes advice and support from doctors, nurses, or dietitians on healthy eating and physical activity.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using digital health tools helps children and adolescents with obesity manage their weight and improve their health.\n\nWe looked at two different situations:\n– using digital tools plus usual care compared to using usual care alone.\n– using digital tools alone compared to using usual care alone.\n\nWe were interested in how these tools affected:\n– body fat and weight\n– physical activity levels\n– quality of life and well-being\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared digital health tools with usual care for children and adolescents (aged 0 to 19) with obesity. To be included, studies had to randomly assign people to receive either a digital health tool or usual care.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 15 studies that included a total of 911 children and adolescents. Most of the people in the studies were teenagers (aged 10 to 19). The studies lasted from a few months to over six months.\n\nDigital tools combined with usual care\nEight studies looked at what happened when digital tools were added to usual care. We found that this combination may slightly reduce body fat compared to usual care alone. We are not sure if this combination had any effect on other things like overall weight or quality of life.\n\nDigital tools used alone\nSeven studies looked at what happened when digital tools were used on their own. The evidence from these studies was not clear. This means we do not know if using digital tools alone has any effect on body fat, weight, or other health measures.\n\nUnwanted effects\nNone of the 15 studies reported on whether the digital tools caused any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons.\n\nMost of the studies were small, which can make the results less reliable. The studies also only looked at effects over a few months, so we do not know about the long-term benefits or risks. Because no studies reported on unwanted effects, we cannot be sure about the safety of these tools.\n\nThere were also some problems with how the studies were done, which lowered our confidence in the evidence.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025."
