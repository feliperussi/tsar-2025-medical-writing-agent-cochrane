    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\n\nDo medicines that promote wakefulness help with extreme sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy?\n\nKey Messages\n\n– Myotonic dystrophy is a long-term condition that causes muscle weakness. Many people with this condition also feel extremely sleepy during the day.\n– Medicines called psychostimulants, which help people stay awake, may help people with myotonic dystrophy feel less sleepy. However, we are very uncertain if these medicines actually help people stay awake longer when measured by sleep tests, or if they improve quality of life.\n– People who take psychostimulants may be more likely to have unwanted effects. We need more research because all the studies we found were small and only lasted for a short time.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy?\n\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic condition that people have for their whole lives. It mainly affects the muscles, causing them to become weak and waste away over time. It can also affect other parts of the body.\n\nA very common symptom is feeling extremely sleepy during the day, even after a full night's sleep. This is called hypersomnia. This sleepiness can make it hard to work, study, or do daily activities.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if medicines called psychostimulants help people with myotonic dystrophy who have extreme daytime sleepiness. Psychostimulants are medicines that increase alertness and help people stay awake.\n\nWe were interested in whether these medicines:\n– helped people stay awake longer in tests\n– made people feel less sleepy\n– improved their overall quality of life\n\nWe also wanted to know if the medicines caused any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared psychostimulants with a placebo (a dummy pill with no medicine in it). The studies had to include adults with myotonic dystrophy and extreme daytime sleepiness.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 136 people. The studies were all short, lasting for four weeks or less.\n\nThe studies showed that when people rated their own sleepiness using a questionnaire, those who took psychostimulants felt less sleepy than those who took a dummy pill.\n\nHowever, when sleepiness was measured with special tests in a sleep lab, we are very uncertain if the medicines made any difference in how long people could stay awake. We are also very uncertain if the medicines improved people's quality of life.\n\nPeople who took psychostimulants may have been more likely to have unwanted effects than those who took a dummy pill.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies we found were very small. Also, the results of the studies were different from each other, which makes it difficult to be sure about the overall findings.\n\nAll the studies were short-term, so we do not know about the benefits and risks of taking these medicines for a long time. More and larger studies are needed to better understand if psychostimulants are helpful and safe for people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
