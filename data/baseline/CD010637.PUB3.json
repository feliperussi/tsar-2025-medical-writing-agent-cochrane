    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan physical exercise help people with chronic venous insufficiency?\n\nKey Messages\n- Chronic venous insufficiency is a long-term condition where veins in the legs have trouble sending blood back to the heart. This can cause pain, swelling, and skin changes.\n- We looked at studies to see if exercise programmes could help people with this condition.\n- We are very uncertain about the effects of exercise because there were only a few small studies, and their results were not clear. We do not know if exercise improves symptoms, blood flow, or quality of life.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, is a condition that affects the veins in your legs. Veins are the tubes that carry blood from the body back to the heart. In CVI, the tiny valves inside the leg veins that help push blood upwards become weak or damaged.\n\nWhen these valves don't work well, blood can flow backwards and pool in the lower legs. This can cause symptoms like:\n– aching or tired legs\n– swelling in the ankles and lower legs\n– varicose veins (swollen, twisted veins you can see under the skin)\n– skin changes, such as discoloration or thickening\n\nIf CVI is not managed, it can sometimes lead to open sores on the legs called venous leg ulcers.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if planned exercise programmes could help people with CVI that had not yet caused leg sores. We compared people who did an exercise programme with people who did not.\n\nWe were interested in whether exercise could:\n– reduce symptoms like pain and swelling\n– improve how well the veins pump blood\n– improve people's quality of life\n– make it easier for people to be active\n– increase muscle strength in the legs\n– improve ankle movement\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise programmes with no exercise in people with CVI. We compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that included a total of 146 people with CVI. The studies were small and used different types of exercise programmes.\n\nBecause the studies were small and their results were unclear, we are very uncertain about the effects of exercise for people with CVI.\n\nWe do not know if exercise helps to reduce symptoms like pain and swelling. We also do not know if it improves how well the veins in the legs pump blood back to the heart.\n\nThe studies did not provide clear answers about whether exercise improves quality of life, muscle strength, or the ability to be active. None of the studies looked at whether exercise could prevent leg sores from developing.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the results. This is because:\n– The studies included only a small number of people. Results from small studies can be unreliable.\n– We had concerns about the way some of the studies were designed and carried out.\n– The exercise programmes were different in each study, and the results were measured in different ways. This made it difficult to compare them.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits or harms of exercise for CVI. More and better research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
