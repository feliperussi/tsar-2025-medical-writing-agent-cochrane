    "output": "Iron given through a vein or taken by mouth for anaemia during pregnancy\n\nKey messages\n\n– For pregnant women with anaemia caused by low iron, getting iron through a vein (intravenous iron) likely increases iron levels in the blood slightly more than taking iron by mouth (oral iron). It also makes it more likely that their anaemia will get better before they give birth.\n\n– Compared to taking iron by mouth, getting iron through a vein probably makes little to no difference to the risk of heavy bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion.\n\n– We are uncertain about the risk of very serious side effects for either type of iron treatment. This is because serious problems were rare in the studies, and the way they were reported made it difficult to compare the treatments confidently.\n\nWhat is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\n\nAnaemia is a condition where you do not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen around your body. During pregnancy, the body needs more iron to support the mother and the growing baby. If a woman does not get enough iron, she can develop iron deficiency anaemia.\n\nCommon symptoms include feeling very tired, weak, dizzy, or short of breath. Severe anaemia can lead to serious problems for both the mother and the baby.\n\nHow is anaemia in pregnancy treated?\n\nThe most common treatment is taking iron tablets or liquids by mouth (oral iron). This is simple, but it can cause side effects like constipation or an upset stomach.\n\nAnother option is to give iron directly into a vein through a drip in the arm. This is called intravenous (or IV) iron. This method can raise iron levels more quickly and avoids stomach side effects, but it needs to be given by a healthcare professional.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving iron through a vein is better and safer than giving iron by mouth for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant women.\n\nWe were interested in how the treatments affected:\n– iron levels in the blood (measured by a protein called haemoglobin)\n– the number of women who still had anaemia before and after birth\n– heavy bleeding after giving birth\n– the need for a blood transfusion\n– any unwanted or harmful effects (side effects)\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared intravenous iron with oral iron in pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 13 studies that included 3939 pregnant women. Most studies were done in India and Africa.\n\nDuring pregnancy\nWomen who received intravenous iron were likely to have slightly higher iron levels in their blood before giving birth compared to women who took oral iron. They were also less likely to still have anaemia before birth.\n\nAfter birth\nWomen who received intravenous iron may have had slightly higher iron levels after giving birth. We are very uncertain if intravenous iron reduces the risk of having very severe anaemia after birth.\n\nSerious problems and side effects\nIntravenous iron probably makes little to no difference to the risk of heavy bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion.\n\nWe are very uncertain about the risk of very serious side effects, such as death or needing to go to an intensive care unit. This is because these events were very rare in the studies, which makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. Overall, intravenous iron probably does not cause more side effects than oral iron, but we cannot be certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for several reasons.\n\nFor some important outcomes, like serious side effects, there was not enough information to be certain about the results. This is because these problems did not happen very often in the studies we found.\n\nAlso, the way side effects were reported was different across the studies, which made it difficult to combine the information accurately. Some studies also had problems with how they were designed or carried out, which could affect the reliability of their results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
