    "output": "Does letting premature babies smell and taste milk help them learn to feed faster?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Premature babies (born too early) often cannot feed from the breast or a bottle and need to be fed through a tube. We wanted to know if letting them smell and taste milk during tube feeds helps them learn to feed by mouth sooner.\n\n– We found that letting babies smell and taste milk probably makes little to no difference to how quickly they learn to feed fully by mouth.\n\n– This approach also seems to have little to no effect on the risk of serious problems, such as a dangerous gut condition (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.\n\nWhat is feeding in premature babies?\n\nBabies born very early are not yet strong enough to feed from a breast or bottle. This is because they cannot yet coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing at the same time.\n\nTo make sure they get the nutrition they need to grow, they are fed milk through a small, soft tube. The tube goes through their nose or mouth directly into their stomach. This is called tube feeding.\n\nAs they get stronger, they slowly learn to feed by mouth. The goal is for them to get all their milk from the breast or a bottle. This is called 'full sucking feeds'.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if letting premature babies smell or taste milk during their tube feeds helps them learn to feed by mouth faster.\n\nWe also wanted to see if this had any effect on:\n– how long it took for babies to get all their food by mouth\n– how long babies needed nutrition given through a vein (a drip)\n– the risk of a serious gut problem called necrotising enterocolitis\n– the risk of serious infections\n– any other unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared letting premature babies smell and taste milk with usual care (tube feeding without the smell or taste).\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many babies were included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies that included 1277 premature babies. The studies looked at what happened while the babies were in the hospital.\n\nOur review found that letting babies smell and taste milk during tube feeds likely makes little to no difference to how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth.\n\nIt also seems to make little to no difference to:\n– how long babies needed nutrition through a vein\n– how quickly they could take all their milk through the feeding tube (instead of a vein)\n– their risk of getting a serious gut problem or a serious infection\n\nTwo studies reported that there were no unwanted effects from letting babies smell and taste milk.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited. This is because many of the studies were small.\n\nThere were also some problems with how the studies were done. For example, in most studies, the doctors and nurses knew which babies were getting to smell and taste the milk. This knowledge might have affected the results. Because of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
