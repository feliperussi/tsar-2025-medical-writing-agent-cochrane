    "output": "Preparing for bowel surgery: does combining laxatives and antibiotics help prevent complications?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For people having planned surgery on their large bowel, preparing the bowel with both strong laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) and antibiotics taken by mouth probably reduces the risk of wound infections and leakage from where the bowel is reconnected, compared to using only laxatives.\n\n– We are very unsure if combining laxatives and antibiotics is better or worse than using only antibiotics by mouth, or using no bowel preparation at all. More research is needed to answer this.\n\n– The studies did not provide much information about the unwanted side effects of these bowel preparations, such as feeling sick or dehydrated.\n\nWhat is colorectal surgery and why is bowel preparation used?\n\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). It is often done to treat conditions like cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe large bowel naturally contains a lot of bacteria. During surgery, these bacteria can sometimes get into the surgical wound or the abdomen, causing serious infections. To reduce this risk, doctors may ask people to clean out their bowel before the operation. This is called bowel preparation.\n\nThere are two main types of bowel preparation:\n– Mechanical bowel preparation: this involves drinking strong laxatives to empty the bowel of all poo.\n– Oral antibiotics: these are medicines taken by mouth to reduce the number of bacteria in the bowel.\n\nSometimes, these two methods are used together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if preparing for planned bowel surgery by using both mechanical bowel preparation (laxatives) and oral antibiotics is better at preventing problems than other methods.\n\nWe were interested in how this combined preparation affected:\n– wound infections (surgical site infections)\n– leakage where the bowel was joined back together (anastomotic leakage)\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– how long it took for the bowel to start working again after surgery\n– death\n– any unwanted side effects of the bowel preparation\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with either mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation in adults having planned bowel surgery.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 people having planned bowel surgery.\n\nCombined preparation compared with laxatives alone\nPeople who had both laxatives and antibiotics were probably less likely to get a wound infection after surgery. They were also probably less likely to have leakage from where their bowel was reconnected. We did not find a clear difference between the groups in how long people stayed in the hospital, how quickly their bowel started working again, or the number of deaths.\n\nCombined preparation compared with antibiotics alone\nWe are very uncertain about the results when comparing combined preparation with using only antibiotics. We do not know if one method is better than the other for preventing infections, leakage, or other problems.\n\nCombined preparation compared with no preparation\nWe are also uncertain about the results when comparing combined preparation with no bowel preparation. We do not know if preparing the bowel this way is better or worse than doing nothing before surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, some of the studies were not conducted as well as they could have been. For example, some did not clearly explain how people were chosen to be in each group. This could have affected the results.\n\nSecond, for some questions, there were only a few small studies. This makes the results less reliable. We are not confident in the findings for the comparisons of combined preparation against antibiotics alone or no preparation.\n\nFinally, very few studies reported on unwanted side effects like feeling sick or dehydrated, so we do not know much about these.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021."
