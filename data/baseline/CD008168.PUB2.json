    "output": "Light therapy for jaundice in newborn babies: is it better to give it with or without breaks?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Jaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that makes their skin and eyes look yellow. It is caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin. It is usually treated with special lights, a treatment called phototherapy.\n\n– We compared giving light therapy with breaks (intermittent phototherapy) to giving it without breaks (continuous phototherapy). We found little or no difference in how quickly the babies' bilirubin levels went down.\n\n– We are not sure if one method is safer than the other. The studies did not provide enough information about serious side effects, like brain damage, to let us compare the two treatments properly.\n\nWhat is jaundice in newborn babies?\n\nJaundice is a very common and usually harmless condition in newborn babies. It causes their skin and the whites of their eyes to turn yellow.\n\nThis yellow color is caused by a substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin is made when old red blood cells are broken down. It is normal to have some bilirubin in the blood. However, if levels get too high, it can be harmful, and in very rare cases can cause brain damage.\n\nHow is jaundice treated?\n\nThe most common treatment for jaundice in newborns is phototherapy. This involves placing the baby under special lights. The light helps the baby's body break down the bilirubin so it can be removed from the body.\n\nPhototherapy can be given in two ways:\n– Continuous phototherapy: the baby stays under the lights without any breaks.\n– Intermittent phototherapy: the baby is under the lights for a set period, followed by a break. This cycle is then repeated.\n\nGiving light therapy with breaks might make it easier for mothers to feed and bond with their babies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if intermittent phototherapy is as safe and effective as continuous phototherapy for treating jaundice in newborn babies.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how quickly bilirubin levels in the blood went down\n– if babies developed brain damage from high bilirubin levels\n– if the treatment failed to work\n– any unwanted effects of the treatment\n– how many babies died\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy in newborn babies with jaundice. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 12 studies that included 1600 newborn babies with jaundice.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– There was probably little or no difference between intermittent and continuous phototherapy in how quickly bilirubin levels went down.\n– We are very uncertain if either treatment is better at preventing brain damage. Only one small study looked at this, and no babies in either group developed brain damage.\n– We are also very uncertain if there is a difference in how often the treatment fails to work.\n– There was probably little or no difference in the number of babies who died.\n\nBabies who received intermittent phototherapy spent less total time under the lights. Some results suggested that continuous phototherapy might work better for premature babies, but we are not sure about this.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not very confident in the results. This is because some of the studies had problems with how they were done, and many were very small.\n\nMost importantly, the studies did not give us enough information about important safety issues, like brain damage. We need larger, better-designed studies before we can be sure that intermittent phototherapy is as safe and effective as continuous phototherapy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022."
