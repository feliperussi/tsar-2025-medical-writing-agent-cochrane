    "output": "What helps reduce stress for healthcare workers?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Activities that help healthcare workers manage their stress may reduce their stress levels for up to a year. These activities can either help people focus on their experience of stress (like mindfulness) or help them focus away from it (like relaxation exercises).\n\n– Using a mix of different stress-reducing activities may also help lower stress for a few months.\n\n– We are not sure about the long-term effects of these activities. We also do not know if training on work-related skills, like time management, helps reduce stress. We need better studies to be more confident in these results.\n\nWhat is work-related stress in healthcare?\n\nHealthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses, often have very demanding jobs. When the demands of the job are greater than the support and skills a person has, it can cause work-related stress.\n\nThis kind of stress can lead to burnout, which is a state of feeling emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted because of your job. It can also cause health problems like headaches or trouble sleeping and may affect the quality of care that patients receive.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers could help reduce their stress. We looked at four different types of support:\n\n– Activities that help people focus on their thoughts and feelings about stress, such as mindfulness or therapy.\n– Activities that help people take their minds off stress, such as relaxation exercises or physical activity.\n– Training to change work-related habits, such as learning better time management.\n– A combination of these different activities.\n\nWe wanted to see how these programs affected stress levels shortly after the program ended (up to 3 months), in the medium term (3 to 12 months), and in the long term (more than 12 months).\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these stress-reducing activities with either no support or a waiting list. The studies had to include healthcare workers who were randomly put into different groups.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 117 studies that included a total of 11,119 healthcare workers.\n\nActivities that help people focus on their stress (like mindfulness) may reduce stress for up to one year.\n\nActivities that help people focus away from stress (like relaxation) may also reduce stress for up to one year.\n\nUsing a combination of different activities may reduce stress for up to 3 months. We are less sure if this benefit continues after 3 months.\n\nWe are very uncertain if training on work-related skills, like time management, helps to reduce stress. There was not enough information to be sure. We are also not sure if one type of activity is better than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited. This is mainly because of problems with how the studies were done. For example, in most studies, the healthcare workers knew they were receiving a stress-reduction program. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their stress levels.\n\nMany studies were also small or did not provide all the details about their methods. Because of these limitations, future research could change our findings. We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the best ways to help healthcare workers manage stress.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
