    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nMedicines, brain stimulation, or talking therapies for depression after a stroke\n\nKey Messages\n– Medicines (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (also known as talking therapies) may help reduce symptoms of depression for people who have had a stroke. However, we are very unsure about these findings.\n\n– Medicines may cause unwanted side effects, such as problems with the nervous system (like feeling dizzy) or the stomach (like feeling sick).\n\n– A treatment called non-invasive brain stimulation, which uses magnetic fields or electrical currents on the head, probably has little to no effect on depression when used by itself.\n\nWhat is depression after a stroke?\nA stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. It can cause long-lasting problems with movement, speech, and thinking. A stroke can also affect a person's mood and feelings.\n\nDepression is a common problem after a stroke. People with depression may feel sad, hopeless, or lose interest in activities they used to enjoy. It can make recovery from the stroke much harder.\n\nHow is depression after a stroke treated?\nThere are several treatments for depression after a stroke. These include:\n– medicines, such as antidepressants\n– psychological therapies, which are talking therapies with a trained professional\n– non-invasive brain stimulation, a treatment that uses gentle electrical currents or magnetic fields to stimulate parts of the brain\n\nThese treatments can be used alone or together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well these different treatments work for depression after a stroke. We also wanted to know if they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nWe looked at how the treatments affected:\n– the number of people whose depression got better\n– the number of people whose depression did not get better\n– any unwanted effects, also called side effects\n– the number of deaths\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments with a dummy treatment (placebo), usual care, or each other. The people in the studies all had depression after having a stroke.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nThis is a 'living review'. This means we search for new studies every two months and will update the review when we find new information.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that included 5831 people with depression after a stroke.\n\nMedicines compared to a dummy pill\nMedicines may help more people recover from depression than a dummy pill. However, people taking medicines were more likely to have side effects affecting their nervous system (like dizziness) and their stomach (like feeling sick).\n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation compared to a fake treatment\nThis treatment probably made little to no difference in helping people recover from depression.\n\nPsychological therapy compared to usual care\nTalking therapies may help more people recover from depression than receiving usual care. These therapies did not appear to cause more unwanted effects than usual care.\n\nCombining treatments\nAdding brain stimulation to medicine may help reduce depression symptoms more than taking medicine alone. We did not find enough information about other combinations of treatments to draw any conclusions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in most of the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because many of the studies were very small. There were also problems with how some of the studies were done, which could make the results unreliable.\n\nBecause of these limitations, our findings are very uncertain. Future research is very likely to change our conclusions. We cannot be sure about the true benefits and risks of these treatments for depression after a stroke.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
