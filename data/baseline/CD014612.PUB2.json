    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nClosing internal gaps during gastric bypass surgery: does it help prevent a serious complication?\n\nKey Messages\n– Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a type of weight-loss surgery. It creates internal gaps inside the belly that can lead to a serious problem called an internal hernia, where the bowel gets trapped.\n– Closing these gaps with stitches during the surgery may reduce the risk of getting an internal hernia later on.\n– Closing the gaps probably makes little to no difference to the risk of other health problems happening soon after surgery. However, we are not very confident in these results because there is not enough good-quality research.\n\nWhat is an internal hernia after gastric bypass surgery?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of surgery to help people with obesity lose weight. During this surgery, the surgeon makes the stomach smaller and reroutes part of the small intestine. This rerouting creates small gaps inside the belly.\n\nSometimes, a part of the intestine can slip through one of these gaps and get trapped. This is called an internal hernia. An internal hernia is a serious problem that can block the bowel and cut off its blood supply. It often requires another surgery to fix.\n\nTo prevent this, some surgeons close the internal gaps with stitches during the original weight-loss surgery. However, other surgeons worry that stitching these gaps might increase the risk of other problems, like kinking the bowel.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if closing the internal gaps during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is better than leaving them open.\n\nWe were interested in how closing the gaps affected:\n– the number of people who got an internal hernia that blocked their bowel\n– any health problems in the first 30 days after surgery\n– the number of people who died in the first 30 days after surgery\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– any health problems that happened during the surgery itself\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared closing the internal gaps with not closing them in people having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that included 3010 people who had gastric bypass surgery. In these studies, one group of people had the internal gaps closed with stitches, and the other group did not.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\nInternal hernia\nFewer people who had the gaps closed developed an internal hernia compared to those who had the gaps left open.\n\nHealth problems and death after surgery\nClosing the gaps probably makes little to no difference to the risk of having other health problems in the 30 days after surgery. We are very uncertain if closing the gaps affects the risk of dying within 30 days of surgery.\n\nHealth problems during surgery\nClosing the gaps may make little to no difference to the risk of having health problems during the operation, but we are very uncertain about this.\n\nLength of hospital stay\nPeople who had the gaps closed may have stayed in the hospital for a slightly longer time. However, we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is low. This is because we only found a small number of studies, and there were some issues with how they were carried out. This means that future research could change our conclusions. We need more, larger, and better-designed studies to be more certain about the benefits and risks of closing these internal gaps.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024."
