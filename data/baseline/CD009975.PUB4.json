    "output": "Videolaryngoscopy or direct laryngoscopy: which is better for placing a breathing tube in newborn babies?\n\nKey Messages\n- Using a videolaryngoscope (a tool with a small camera) to place a breathing tube in a newborn baby may increase the chance of success on the first try and may mean fewer attempts are needed compared to the standard method.\n- Using a videolaryngoscope likely reduces the chance of minor injury to the baby's airway during the procedure.\n- We are not sure if using a videolaryngoscope is faster than the standard method, or if it reduces other problems like a drop in the baby's oxygen levels or heart rate.\n\nWhat is placing a breathing tube in a newborn?\nSometimes, newborn babies have trouble breathing on their own, especially if they are born early or have medical problems. To help them breathe, doctors may need to place a thin plastic tube into their windpipe (trachea). This procedure is called tracheal intubation. The tube is then connected to a machine that helps the baby breathe.\n\nPlacing the tube quickly and safely is very important for the baby's health.\n\nHow is a breathing tube placed?\nTo place a breathing tube, doctors use a tool called a laryngoscope to gently lift the baby's tongue and see the opening of the windpipe.\n\nThere are two main ways to do this:\n- Direct laryngoscopy: This is the standard method. The doctor looks directly down the baby's throat to see the windpipe opening.\n- Videolaryngoscopy: This method uses a laryngoscope with a tiny camera on the end. The camera sends a picture to a video screen, giving the doctor a magnified view of the baby's throat.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope is better and safer than using a direct laryngoscope for placing breathing tubes in newborn babies (from birth up to 28 days old).\n\nWe were interested in:\n- how often the tube was placed successfully on the first try\n- the total number of tries needed\n- how long the procedure took\n- any unwanted effects, such as injury to the baby's throat, a drop in oxygen levels, or a slow heart rate\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in newborn babies. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included 759 attempts to place a breathing tube in newborn babies.\n\nCompared to the standard method (direct laryngoscopy), we found that using a videolaryngoscope:\n- may increase the chance of placing the breathing tube successfully on the first try.\n- may reduce the total number of attempts needed to place the tube.\n- may not make the procedure any faster.\n- likely reduces the risk of minor injury to the baby's airway.\n\nThe evidence was very unclear about whether using a videolaryngoscope affected the risk of the baby's oxygen levels or heart rate dropping during the procedure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in most of the results is limited. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were done. For example, in some studies, the doctors knew which method they were using, which might have influenced the results. Also, some of the studies were small.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the benefits and risks. More and better research is needed to give us a clearer answer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022."
