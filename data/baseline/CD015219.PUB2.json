    "output": "Does the antiviral medicine favipiravir help people with COVID-19?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We are very uncertain if favipiravir helps people with COVID-19 get better faster, or if it stops them from dying or needing a breathing machine (a machine that helps you breathe).\n\n– Favipiravir may cause more unwanted effects (side effects) overall, but it may make little to no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It can spread easily from person to person. Most people have mild to moderate symptoms, like a fever, cough, and tiredness. Some people become very sick and need to go to the hospital. They may have trouble breathing and need extra oxygen or a breathing machine.\n\nHow is COVID-19 treated?\n\nDoctors may use different medicines to treat COVID-19, especially for people who are very sick. Some of these are antiviral medicines, which are designed to stop the virus from making copies of itself in the body. Favipiravir is one such antiviral medicine.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if favipiravir is a helpful and safe treatment for people with COVID-19.\n\nWe were interested in how favipiravir affected:\n– how many people died\n– if people's illness got worse (for example, needing a breathing machine or oxygen)\n– how long it took for people to get better\n– if people who were not in the hospital needed to be admitted\n– any unwanted effects from the treatment\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at favipiravir compared with a placebo (a dummy pill), standard care, or other antiviral medicines in people with COVID-19.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 25 studies that included 5750 people with COVID-19. Most people in the studies were in the hospital with mild to moderate illness. The studies lasted between 5 and 14 days.\n\nWe are very uncertain if favipiravir makes any difference to the number of people who died from COVID-19.\n\nWe are also very uncertain if favipiravir stops people's illness from getting worse and needing a breathing machine.\n\nFor people treated outside of the hospital, favipiravir may make little to no difference to their chances of needing to be admitted.\n\nWe do not know if favipiravir helps people get better faster.\n\nPeople taking favipiravir may be more likely to have unwanted effects. However, favipiravir may make little to no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is low. In many cases, we are very uncertain about the effects of favipiravir.\n\nThis is because some of the studies were small, and there were problems with how some of them were carried out. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023."
