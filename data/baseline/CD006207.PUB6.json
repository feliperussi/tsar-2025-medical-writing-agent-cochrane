    "output": "Can wearing masks and washing hands help stop the spread of breathing viruses?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Wearing medical or surgical masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a breathing illness like COVID-19 or the flu.\n\n– For healthcare workers, using special N95/P2 masks (masks that fit tightly to the face) probably makes little or no difference compared to using medical or surgical masks for preventing a breathing illness.\n\n– Washing hands regularly may help to slightly reduce the number of people who get a breathing illness.\n\nWhat are breathing viruses?\n\nBreathing viruses cause infections of the nose, throat, and lungs. These are also called acute respiratory infections. They develop suddenly and last a short time. Examples include the flu, COVID-19, and the common cold. These viruses spread from person to person through tiny droplets in the air when someone coughs, sneezes, or talks.\n\nDuring worldwide outbreaks, called pandemics, these viruses can spread quickly and make many people sick.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if simple physical actions can stop or slow down the spread of breathing viruses. We looked at studies of:\n\n– wearing masks\n– washing hands\n– using hand sanitizers\n– wearing gloves, gowns, or face shields\n– keeping a distance from others\n– screening people for signs of illness before they enter a place\n\nWe also wanted to know if these actions caused any unwanted effects, like discomfort.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these physical actions with no action, or with a different action. The studies had to include people from the general community or healthcare workers.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how big they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 78 studies. The studies included hundreds of thousands of people from around the world, in both community settings like schools and cities, and in hospitals. Some studies took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, while others were done during flu seasons.\n\nWearing masks\n\nComparing medical or surgical masks to wearing no mask probably makes little or no difference to who gets a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. It also probably makes little or no difference to how many people have their illness confirmed by a lab test.\n\nComparing N95/P2 masks to medical or surgical masks for healthcare workers also probably makes little or no difference in their risk of getting a breathing virus.\n\nWashing hands\n\nWashing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitizer may lead to a small reduction in the number of people who get a breathing illness. This could mean that out of 1000 people, about 53 fewer people might get sick if they wash their hands regularly.\n\nOther actions\n\nWe did not find any reliable studies about the effects of wearing gloves and gowns, face shields, or screening people for illness at airports and other entry points.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is low for most of our findings. This is for a few main reasons.\n\nFirst, there were problems with how some of the studies were done, which could have affected their results.\n\nSecond, in many studies, people did not always do what they were asked to do. For example, many people did not wear masks or wash their hands regularly throughout the studies. This makes it hard to know if these actions work when used correctly all the time.\n\nFinally, the studies were done in many different places and during different virus outbreaks. This makes it difficult to combine the results and draw strong conclusions that apply to everyone.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
