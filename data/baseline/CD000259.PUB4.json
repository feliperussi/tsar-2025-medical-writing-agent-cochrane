    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes giving healthcare professionals feedback on their work improve the care they provide?\n\nKey Messages\n– Giving healthcare professionals feedback on their work can lead to small but important improvements in the care they provide. This process is called 'audit and feedback'. It involves checking how a professional is doing their job (the audit) and then sharing the results with them (the feedback).\n– Feedback seems to work better when it is about a professional's own personal work, not their team's. It also helps if their work is compared to top performers or a set standard.\n– Providing feedback with a clear plan for how to improve, and having a trusted colleague deliver it, may also make it more effective.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback?\nHealthcare professionals, like doctors and nurses, want to provide the best possible care. One way to help them do this is through a process called audit and feedback.\n\nThis is like a report card for their work. First, information is collected about the care they provide over a period of time. This is the 'audit'. For example, it might check how often a doctor prescribes the right medicine for a certain illness.\n\nNext, this information is shared with the healthcare professional. This is the 'feedback'. The goal is to help them see where they are doing well and where they could improve.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if audit and feedback helps healthcare professionals improve the care they give to patients.\n\nWe also wanted to know what makes feedback more effective. For example, does it matter how the feedback is given, or who gives it?\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the care provided by healthcare professionals who received audit and feedback with those who did not.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how large they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 292 studies that looked at this question. Most of the studies focused on doctors and looked at things like prescribing medicines and ordering medical tests.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– Audit and feedback generally leads to small improvements in professional practice.\n– Feedback was often given along with other support, like educational materials, which may have also helped.\n\nWe also found that some ways of giving feedback seemed to work better than others. Feedback was more likely to lead to improvements when:\n– It was about an individual's work, not a whole team's.\n– It compared a professional's work to that of top performers or to a high standard.\n– It was delivered by a respected colleague.\n– It was given in different ways, such as in writing and in a face-to-face conversation.\n– It came with a clear action plan and support to help the professional make changes.\n\nWe found that giving feedback more often did not necessarily lead to bigger improvements.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are reasonably confident in our findings. However, there were some limitations.\n\nMany of the studies had problems in how they were designed or carried out, which could affect the reliability of their results. Also, because feedback was often combined with other types of support, it is hard to know exactly how much of the improvement was due to the feedback alone.\n\nFinally, the effect of feedback varied a lot between studies. This means that while it can be helpful, we cannot be certain how much it will improve care in every situation.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
