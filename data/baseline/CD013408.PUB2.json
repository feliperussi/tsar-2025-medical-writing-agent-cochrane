    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of organised care programs for people with atrial fibrillation?\n\nKey Messages\n\n– For people with atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often fast heartbeat), special organised care programs probably help them live longer compared to usual care.\n\n– We are confident that these programs also reduce the need for hospital stays for heart and blood vessel problems.\n\n– However, these programs may not make a difference to the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason, or the risk of having a stroke (a dangerous blood clot in the brain) or major bleeding.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation?\n\nAtrial fibrillation, often called AF, is a common heart condition that causes an irregular and often very fast heartbeat. When you have AF, the top chambers of your heart (the atria) beat chaotically instead of pumping blood effectively.\n\nThis can cause symptoms like feeling your heart flutter or race, shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness. Having AF also increases a person's risk of having a stroke, because the irregular blood flow can cause harmful blood clots to form in the heart.\n\nHow is atrial fibrillation treated?\n\nManaging AF is complex. Treatment often involves:\n\n– medicines to control the heart's rhythm or rate\n– blood thinners (anticoagulants) to prevent strokes\n– procedures to correct the heart's rhythm\n\nBecause managing AF involves different treatments and lifestyle changes, some hospitals have created special programs to help people with the condition. These programs often involve a team of health professionals, such as doctors, specialist nurses, and pharmacists, who work together. Some programs also use technology like smartphone apps to help people manage their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if these special, organised care programs are better than the usual care people get for AF.\n\nWe were particularly interested in how these programs affected:\n\n– death from any cause\n– being admitted to the hospital for any reason\n– death from heart or blood vessel problems\n– being admitted to the hospital for heart or blood vessel problems\n– harmful blood clots, such as a stroke\n– serious bleeding events\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared organised care programs with usual care for adults with AF. The organised care programs had to involve a team of different health professionals working together.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies that included a total of 8205 people with AF. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia.\n\nCompared to usual care, we found that organised care programs:\n\n– probably help people live longer.\n– reduce the need for hospital stays for heart and blood vessel problems. We are confident in this finding.\n– probably make little to no difference to the number of people admitted to the hospital for any reason.\n– may not reduce the risk of dying from a heart or blood vessel problem.\n– may make little to no difference to the risk of having a stroke or a major bleeding event.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in some of the results is limited. In most of the studies, the people taking part and their doctors knew which type of care they were receiving. This could have influenced the results.\n\nFor some outcomes, like the risk of stroke or death from heart problems, we are less confident in the findings. This is because there were not many studies, or there were problems with how they were carried out. Future research might change these results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
