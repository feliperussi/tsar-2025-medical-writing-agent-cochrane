    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes giving sugar water to newborn babies help reduce pain from a heel prick?\n\nKey Messages\n– Giving newborn babies a small amount of sucrose (a type of sugar) by mouth probably helps reduce their pain from a single heel prick compared to giving them plain water or no treatment.\n\n– Sucrose seems to work about as well for pain relief as giving other types of sugar (like glucose), expressed breast milk, or having skin-to-skin contact with a parent.\n\n– We are very uncertain if sucrose is better or worse than other comforting methods like breastfeeding, using a pacifier (dummy), or special holding techniques. More research is needed to compare these methods.\n\nWhat is a heel prick procedure?\nNewborn babies often need blood tests for health checks. A common way to get a small blood sample is by pricking the baby's heel with a tiny needle. This is called a heel prick or heel lance.\n\nWhile the procedure is quick and important for the baby's health, it can be painful and cause distress. Researchers are looking for simple and safe ways to reduce this pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving sucrose to newborn babies before a heel prick is an effective way to reduce their pain.\n\nWe compared sucrose to several other methods, including:\n– plain water or no treatment\n– other sugars, like glucose\n– breastfeeding or expressed breast milk\n– comforting methods like using a pacifier, skin-to-skin contact, or special holding techniques\n\nWe also looked to see if there were any unwanted effects from using sucrose.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at giving sucrose to newborn babies having a heel prick. The studies compared sucrose with other pain-relief methods or no treatment.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 55 studies that included a total of 6273 newborn babies. The studies looked at babies born on time (term) and babies born early (preterm).\n\nOur main findings were:\n\nSucrose compared to water or no treatment\nBabies who received sucrose probably showed fewer signs of pain right after the heel prick compared to babies who received plain water or no treatment. We are moderately confident in this finding.\n\nSucrose compared to other sugars or milk\nSucrose appeared to be as effective at reducing pain as glucose (another type of sugar). It also seemed to work about as well as expressed breast milk.\n\nSucrose compared to other comforting methods\nWe are very uncertain about how sucrose compares to other comforting methods. The evidence was not clear enough to show if sucrose was better, worse, or the same as:\n– breastfeeding\n– non-nutritive sucking (sucking on a pacifier or dummy)\n– laser acupuncture\n– facilitated tucking (holding the baby in a curled-up position)\n– skin-to-skin contact\n\nNo major unwanted effects were reported in the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence for many comparisons is low. This is because some studies were very small, and there were some problems with how the studies were done.\n\nFor many of the comforting methods, there was not enough information to draw strong conclusions. This means we cannot be sure about the results and more research could change our findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
