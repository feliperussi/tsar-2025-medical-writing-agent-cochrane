    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nAre heart recovery programs at home as good as those in a hospital or clinic?\n\nKey Messages\n– Cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education to help people recover after a heart problem, like a heart attack or heart surgery. We found that programs based at home seem to be as effective as programs based in a hospital or community centre.\n\n– For up to one year, people in home-based programs and centre-based programs had similar results for their risk of dying, their ability to exercise, and their quality of life.\n\n– Because both types of programs appear to work equally well, people may be able to choose the option that best suits their lifestyle and personal needs.\n\nWhat is cardiac rehabilitation?\nAfter a serious heart problem, such as a heart attack, heart failure, or heart surgery, doctors often recommend a program called cardiac rehabilitation, or 'cardiac rehab'.\n\nThese programs help people recover, get stronger, and reduce their risk of having more heart problems in the future. Cardiac rehab usually includes exercise training, education on living a heart-healthy life, and counselling to reduce stress.\n\nTraditionally, people went to a hospital or a community centre for cardiac rehab. Now, there are also options to do the program from home, sometimes with support from health workers over the phone or online.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehab is as good as centre-based cardiac rehab for people with heart disease.\n\nWe were interested in how the two types of programs compared for:\n– the number of deaths\n– people's ability to exercise\n– people's health-related quality of life\n– whether people completed the program\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based cardiac rehab with centre-based cardiac rehab for adults with heart disease.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that included a total of 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies followed people for up to one year.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– There was probably little to no difference in the risk of dying within one year between people who did home-based rehab and those who did centre-based rehab.\n– People's ability to exercise was likely similar after one year, no matter which type of program they did.\n– People's quality of life also seemed to be similar between the two groups.\n– People were just as likely to complete the program whether it was at home or at a centre. The cost of both types of programs was also similar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in our findings. This is because some of the studies did not provide enough information about how they were carried out, which makes it difficult to be sure about the results.\n\nAlso, most studies only followed people for up to one year. This means we know less about the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehab. More research is needed to see if these effects last over a longer period.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
