    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of immunotherapy for a type of brain cancer called glioma?\n\nKey Messages\n– Immunotherapy is a treatment that helps your own immune system fight cancer. For people with glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of glioma brain tumor, a type of immunotherapy called anti-PD-1 medicines (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) probably does not help them live longer or stop the cancer from growing.\n– This seems to be true for people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma as well as for people whose cancer has come back after treatment.\n– Adding these immunotherapy medicines to standard treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy (using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells) does not seem to add any benefit and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is glioma?\nA glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The most common and aggressive type of glioma in adults is called glioblastoma. People with glioblastoma usually do not live for a long time, even with treatment. This is because the cancer is very difficult to treat and often comes back.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if a type of immunotherapy medicine called anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 helps people with glioma. These medicines are designed to help the body's immune system find and attack cancer cells.\n\nWe were interested in how these medicines affected:\n– how long people lived\n– how long it took for the cancer to get worse\n– serious unwanted effects from the treatment\n– whether the tumors shrank\n– people's quality of life\n– less serious unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 medicines with either a dummy treatment (placebo) or other standard cancer treatments. The people in the studies were adults with glioma.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that included a total of 1953 people with glioblastoma.\n\nFor people whose glioblastoma had come back after initial treatment:\n– The immunotherapy medicine nivolumab probably did not help people live longer compared to another cancer medicine called bevacizumab.\n– One very small study looked at giving the immunotherapy medicine pembrolizumab both before and after surgery. The results suggested this might help people live longer, but we are very uncertain about this finding because the study was so small.\n\nFor people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma:\n– Adding the immunotherapy medicine nivolumab to standard treatments like radiotherapy or chemotherapy probably did not help people live longer.\n– In one study, adding nivolumab to chemotherapy and radiotherapy probably increased the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited.\n\nMost of the studies had problems in how they were designed or carried out, which could affect the reliability of their results. Also, some of the studies were very small.\n\nBecause the studies tested different medicines in different groups of people, we could not combine their results to get a stronger overall answer. For these reasons, we are not very confident in the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
