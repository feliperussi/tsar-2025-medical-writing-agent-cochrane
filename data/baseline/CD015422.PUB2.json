    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan creams and sprays that repel mosquitoes help prevent malaria?\n\nKey Messages\n– Topical repellents are creams or sprays that you put on your skin to stop mosquitoes from biting you. Using these repellents may slightly reduce the number of people who get sick with malaria, but we are not very confident in this finding.\n– Repellents may be most helpful for people who are at high risk of getting malaria and who may not have other ways to protect themselves, such as refugees or people who work in forests.\n– Topical repellents appear to be safe. Very few people who used them had unwanted effects, which were mostly mild skin reactions.\n\nWhat is malaria?\nMalaria is a serious illness found in many tropical parts of the world. It is caused by a tiny parasite that gets into the blood. People get malaria from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nSymptoms of malaria often feel like the flu. They can include a high temperature, sweating, chills, headaches, and feeling sick. Without treatment, malaria can be life-threatening.\n\nHow is malaria usually prevented?\nThe main ways to prevent malaria focus on stopping mosquito bites, especially at night when people are sleeping. These methods include:\n– sleeping under special bed nets treated with insect-killing medicine (insecticide-treated nets)\n– spraying the inside walls of homes with insect-killing medicine (indoor residual spraying)\n\nThese methods work well against mosquitoes that bite indoors at night. However, they do not protect people from mosquitoes that bite outdoors or during the day.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents on the skin helps to prevent people from getting malaria. We looked at whether repellents were used by themselves or along with other prevention methods like bed nets.\n\nWe were interested in the effects of repellents on:\n– the number of new malaria infections\n– the number of people who got sick with malaria\n– any unwanted side effects from using the repellents\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared people using topical repellents with people who did not use them or used a fake repellent without any active ingredient. The studies included people living in areas where malaria is common.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included over 61,000 people.\n\nThe studies showed that using topical repellents may slightly reduce a person's chance of getting malaria. However, this effect was mostly seen in groups of people at high risk, such as refugees living in camps where they might not have had access to other protection like bed nets.\n\nIn places where people were already using other prevention methods like bed nets, it was not clear if adding topical repellents gave any extra protection.\n\nTopical repellents seem to be very safe. Only a very small number of people had mild skin reactions, like a rash.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the results. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were designed and carried out. For example, in some studies, it was difficult to make sure people used the repellents correctly all the time.\n\nBecause our confidence in the evidence is low, we cannot be sure about the effects of topical repellents. Future research could lead to different conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
