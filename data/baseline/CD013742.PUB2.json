    "output": "How accurate are lab tests for finding vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We looked at how well common lab tests can find vitamin A deficiency, which is when your body does not have enough vitamin A.\n\n– The tests were generally good at correctly telling people they do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, the tests often missed people who did have the condition. This means a person could have a normal test result but still have a vitamin A deficiency.\n\n– We are not very confident in these results because the studies we found were not designed to check the accuracy of these tests. More research is needed to be sure.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\n\nVitamin A is a nutrient your body needs to stay healthy. It is important for good vision, a strong immune system (your body's defense against illness), and healthy growth.\n\nVitamin A deficiency happens when you do not have enough vitamin A in your body. This is a serious problem, especially for children and pregnant women. It can lead to eye problems, make it harder to fight off infections, and slow down growth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nDoctors use different lab tests to see if someone has vitamin A deficiency. We wanted to find out how accurate these common tests are.\n\nThe main tests we looked at were blood tests that measure:\n– serum retinol\n– retinol-binding protein (a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood)\n\nWe compared these common tests to more complex and accurate tests to see how well they worked.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency with more accurate, \"gold standard\" tests. The studies included people who were at risk of having the condition.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 40 studies. The main finding was that the common lab tests were not very good at identifying people who truly had vitamin A deficiency. Many people who had the condition according to the more accurate tests were missed by the common tests.\n\nHowever, the common tests were much better at identifying people who did not have vitamin A deficiency. If a person's test result was normal, it was very likely that they did not have the condition.\n\nThese findings were similar for the different types of common blood tests we looked at.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. The main problem is that none of the studies we found were specifically designed to check how accurate these tests are. Many of the studies were also small.\n\nBecause of these problems, we cannot be certain about the accuracy of these tests. We need better-designed studies to get a clearer answer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
