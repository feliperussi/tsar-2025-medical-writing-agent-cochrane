    "output": "Do programs that teach people to manage their own vision problems improve their quality of life?\n\nKey messages\n\n– For adults with vision problems, programs that teach people how to manage their condition (self-management programs) may make little to no difference to their overall quality of life.\n\n– These programs also may make little to no difference to quality of life specifically related to vision.\n\n– We are not very confident in these results because of how the studies were designed and carried out. More research is needed to be sure about the effects of these programs.\n\nWhat are vision problems?\n\nVision problems, also called visual impairment, mean a person has trouble seeing even with glasses or contact lenses. This is a major health issue that affects over 2 billion people around the world. It is most common in older adults because of eye diseases that happen with age.\n\nLosing vision can make it hard to do daily activities like reading, cooking, or getting around. It can also affect a person's mood and mental well-being.\n\nHow are vision problems treated?\n\nTo help people live well with vision problems, doctors may suggest self-management programs. These programs aim to teach people skills to manage their condition. This can include learning how to use vision aids, making changes at home to stay safe, and finding ways to cope with the emotional challenges of vision loss.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs help improve the quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared these programs to either usual care (the standard support a person gets) or no program at all (being on a waiting list).\n\nWe were interested in the effects on:\n– overall quality of life\n– quality of life related to vision\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program in adults with vision problems.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 20 studies that included 3151 people. The people in the studies were mostly older adults, with an average age between 60 and 84 years. Most had vision loss because of an eye condition called age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe self-management programs in the studies were all different. They included things like problem-solving training, learning to use low-vision devices, and getting support from others.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n– Self-management programs may make little to no difference to a person's overall quality of life compared to usual care or no program.\n\n– The programs also may make little to no difference to quality of life specifically related to a person's vision.\n\n– Self-management programs may not increase the risk of unwanted effects. Three studies found no problems related to the programs. One study reported that more people in the program group were referred to a doctor for symptoms of depression compared to the group on a waiting list.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence we found. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were done. Also, the results from different studies were not always consistent with each other.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the true effects of self-management programs. Future studies that are better designed could give us more reliable answers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024."
