    "output": "Preparing the womb for frozen embryo transfer: which method is best?\n\nKey messages\n\n– A frozen embryo transfer (FET) is a fertility treatment where a frozen embryo is placed into a woman's womb to try to create a pregnancy. Before the transfer, the lining of the womb must be prepared.\n\n– The womb can be prepared in different ways: by letting the body's natural monthly cycle work on its own (natural cycle), or by using hormone medicines to build up the womb lining (hormone therapy).\n\n– We are uncertain if one method of preparing the womb is better than another for increasing the chance of a live birth or reducing the risk of miscarriage. The evidence we found is not strong enough to be sure.\n\nWhat is a frozen embryo transfer?\n\nSome people use in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to help them have a baby. In IVF, eggs are collected from a woman's ovaries and mixed with sperm in a lab to create embryos. Sometimes, these embryos are frozen to be used later.\n\nWhen a person is ready to use a frozen embryo, it is thawed and placed into their womb. This is called a frozen embryo transfer, or FET. For an FET to be successful, the lining of the womb must be thick enough for the embryo to attach to it.\n\nHow is the womb prepared for a frozen embryo transfer?\n\nThere are several ways to prepare the womb lining for an FET:\n\n– Natural cycle: The clinic monitors the woman's natural monthly cycle and transfers the embryo at the right time, without using hormone medicines.\n\n– Modified natural cycle: This is like a natural cycle, but the woman is given an injection of a hormone called HCG. This injection helps to time the release of an egg (ovulation) so the clinic knows the best time to transfer the embryo.\n\n– Hormone therapy (HT): The woman takes hormone medicines (oestrogen and progesterone) to build up the womb lining.\n\n– Hormone therapy with GnRHa: This is the same as hormone therapy, but with an extra medicine called a GnRH agonist (GnRHa). This medicine stops the body's own hormones from interfering with the treatment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which method of preparing the womb is best for women having an FET. We were most interested in finding out which method leads to:\n\n– more live births\n– fewer miscarriages\n– more ongoing pregnancies\n– fewer multiple pregnancies (twins or triplets)\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these different methods for preparing the womb. We compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 32 studies that included 6352 women having an FET.\n\nThe studies compared the different methods against each other. For example, some studies compared the natural cycle with hormone therapy. Others compared hormone therapy with and without the extra GnRHa medicine.\n\nFor nearly all the comparisons, we are uncertain if one method is better than another for increasing the chance of a live birth or reducing the risk of miscarriage. The results suggested there may be little or no difference between the methods, but we cannot be sure. This was true when comparing:\n\n– natural cycle versus hormone therapy\n– natural cycle versus modified natural cycle\n– hormone therapy versus hormone therapy with GnRHa\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not very confident in the results. This is because many of the studies we found were small. Some studies also had problems with how they were done, which could make their results less reliable. Because of these limitations, we cannot be certain which method works best. More and better research is needed to help people make informed decisions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
