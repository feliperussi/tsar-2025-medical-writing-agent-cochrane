    "output": "Nasal high flow therapy for premature babies with breathing problems\n\nKey messages\n\n– For premature babies who need breathing support, using nasal high flow (nHF) therapy probably leads to less injury to the nose compared to two other types of breathing support called CPAP and NIPPV. nHF therapy uses small tubes in the nose to deliver warm, moist air and oxygen.\n\n– Compared to CPAP, babies using nHF may be more likely to need to switch to another type of breathing support. However, this does not seem to lead to more babies needing a breathing tube placed down their throat.\n\n– We are not sure how well nHF therapy works for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks), because not enough of these babies were included in the studies.\n\nWhat are breathing problems in premature babies?\n\nBabies born early (prematurely) often have lungs that are not fully developed. This can make it hard for them to breathe on their own. This condition is often called respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nThese babies need help to get enough oxygen to their bodies and brains. They are often given breathing support using machines that gently push air and oxygen into their lungs.\n\nHow are breathing problems treated?\n\nDoctors can use several types of breathing support that do not require putting a tube down the baby's throat. These are called non-invasive support. They use small masks or soft tubes that sit in the baby's nose. This review looked at three types:\n\n– Nasal high flow (nHF) therapy: delivers a continuous flow of warm, moist air and oxygen through two small tubes in the nose.\n\n– Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): delivers a steady stream of air and oxygen through a mask or tubes in the nose to keep the lungs open.\n\n– Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV): delivers breaths of air at a higher pressure through a mask or tubes in the nose.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using nHF therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies, compared to other types of non-invasive support.\n\nWe were most interested in:\n– how many babies died or developed a long-term lung problem called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD);\n– whether the first treatment failed and the baby needed to switch to another type of support;\n– whether babies needed a breathing tube put down their throat (mechanical ventilation);\n- unwanted effects, like injury to the nose or a collapsed lung (a serious condition called a pneumothorax).\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared nHF therapy with other types of breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 13 studies that included 2540 premature babies.\n\nNasal high flow (nHF) compared with CPAP\n\nMost studies compared nHF with CPAP. Compared with CPAP, nHF therapy:\n– probably makes little to no difference to the number of babies who died or developed the long-term lung problem BPD.\n– likely leads to more treatment failures. This means more babies on nHF needed to be switched to another type of breathing support.\n– likely makes little to no difference in the number of babies who needed a breathing tube down their throat.\n– likely causes less injury to the baby's nose.\n– may slightly reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nNasal high flow (nHF) compared with NIPPV\n\nFewer studies compared nHF with NIPPV. Compared with NIPPV, nHF therapy:\n– may make little to no difference to the number of babies who died or developed BPD, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n– likely makes little to no difference in the number of treatment failures or babies needing a breathing tube.\n– likely causes less injury to the baby's nose.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for several reasons. Some studies were not conducted very well, which could affect the results. For some of our questions, the results from the studies were not consistent.\n\nMost importantly, very few extremely premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy) were included in the studies. This means we cannot be sure how well nHF works for the smallest and sickest babies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
