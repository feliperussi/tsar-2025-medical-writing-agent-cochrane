    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nPersonalizing hormone doses for IVF or ICSI using ovarian reserve tests: does it improve the chance of having a baby?\n\nKey Messages\n– It is not clear if personalizing the dose of fertility hormones based on ovarian reserve tests improves the chance of having a baby. Ovarian reserve tests are used to estimate how many eggs a woman has. There might be a small benefit, but we are not sure.\n\n– Using these tests to guide the hormone dose may reduce the risk of a side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a condition where the ovaries swell and become painful after taking fertility hormones.\n\n– We are not very confident in these results because of issues with how the studies were designed and because they used many different hormone plans.\n\nWhat is fertility treatment with IVF or ICSI?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are treatments that help people have a baby. During these treatments, women take daily injections of a hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone encourages the ovaries to produce several eggs at once, instead of the single egg that is usually released each month.\n\nThe goal is to collect a good number of eggs – not too few and not too many. If too few eggs are produced, the treatment cycle may be cancelled. If too many eggs are produced, it can lead to a painful and sometimes dangerous side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nDoctors often try to personalize the dose of FSH for each woman. They may use tests called ovarian reserve tests (ORTs) to predict how a woman’s ovaries will respond to the hormones. These tests can include blood tests to measure hormone levels or ultrasound scans to count the number of egg-containing sacs (follicles) in the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ovarian reserve tests to choose a personalized dose of FSH is better than using a standard dose for all women.\n\nWe were most interested in how this affected:\n– the number of women who had a baby (live birth) or an ongoing pregnancy\n– the number of women who developed severe OHSS\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared personalized FSH doses based on ovarian reserve tests with standard FSH doses in women having IVF or ICSI.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that included 8520 women.\n\nThe studies made two main comparisons:\n\n1. Giving different hormone doses to women with similar test results\nSome studies grouped women based on whether their test results predicted a low, normal, or high response to the hormones. They then tested different doses within these groups. For all three groups, we are not sure if giving a higher or lower dose of hormones made any difference to the chance of having a baby or developing OHSS. The results were not clear.\n\n2. Using a personalized plan versus a standard dose for everyone\nOther studies compared a personalized hormone plan based on test results with giving all women the same standard dose.\n\nWe found that:\n– It is not clear if using a personalized plan improves the chance of having a baby. There might be a small increase in success, but there might also be no difference. For example, if 25 out of 100 women have a baby with a standard dose, our results suggest that between 25 and 31 out of 100 women might have a baby with a personalized dose.\n\n– Using a personalized plan may reduce the risk of developing moderate or severe OHSS. For example, if 5 out of 100 women get OHSS with a standard dose, between 2 and 5 women might get it with a personalized dose.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the results. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were done. For example, in many studies, the women and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nAlso, the studies used many different tests and hormone plans. This made it difficult to combine their results and draw firm conclusions about which plans work best.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023."
