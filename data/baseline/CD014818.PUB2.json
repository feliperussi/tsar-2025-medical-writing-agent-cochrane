    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhich type of pain relief injection works best after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey Messages\n– We looked at four different types of pain relief injections, called nerve blocks, for women who had surgery for breast cancer. These injections are given to numb the area and reduce pain after the operation.\n– We found that all four types of nerve blocks seem to work about the same for reducing pain. The differences between them were very small and probably not noticeable to a person recovering from surgery.\n– Very few unwanted effects from the injections were reported in the studies we found. However, not many studies looked carefully for these effects, so we are not sure about the risks of each type of injection.\n\nWhat is pain after breast cancer surgery?\nMany women with breast cancer have surgery to remove the cancer. Like any surgery, this can cause pain afterwards. Good pain control is important for helping people feel more comfortable, move around sooner, and recover better.\n\nOne way to manage this pain is with a special type of pain relief injection called a nerve block. A doctor injects numbing medicine near the nerves in the chest or back. This blocks pain signals from the surgery area from reaching the brain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nThere are several different types of nerve blocks that can be used for breast cancer surgery. We wanted to find out which of these injections work best and have the fewest unwanted effects.\n\nWe looked at four types of nerve blocks:\n– paravertebral block (PVB)\n– erector spinae plane block (ESPB)\n– pectoral nerve block (PEC)\n– serratus anterior plane block (SAPB)\n\nWe were most interested in:\n– pain levels after surgery, both when resting and when moving\n– any unwanted effects or problems caused by the injections\n\nWe also looked at how well people recovered, how long it took before they needed other pain medicine, and if they felt sick or threw up after surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these different nerve blocks with each other in women having breast cancer surgery.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 39 studies that included a total of 2348 women. The studies took place in several countries around the world. Most women in the studies were having a surgery called a modified radical mastectomy.\n\nOur main findings are:\n– All four types of nerve blocks seem to provide similar pain relief after surgery.\n– When we compared the injections, we found only very small differences in pain scores. For example, one type of injection (PEC) seemed slightly better at reducing pain than another (PVB), but the difference was so small that a person would probably not be able to feel it.\n– There was not enough information to know if one injection was better than another for reducing pain when people were moving.\n– The studies that looked for unwanted effects did not report any serious problems like nerve damage, bleeding, or infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results varies. We are quite confident that all four nerve blocks provide similar levels of pain relief when a person is resting.\n\nHowever, we are less confident about other findings. This is because many of the studies were small. When studies are small, their results are less certain. Also, very few studies reported on unwanted effects, so we cannot be sure about the safety of the different injections. We need more and larger studies to be more certain about the benefits and risks of each type of nerve block.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
