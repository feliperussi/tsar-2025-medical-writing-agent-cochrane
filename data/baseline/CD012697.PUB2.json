    "output": "Magnetic seizure therapy or electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We looked at the evidence for a treatment called magnetic seizure therapy (MST) for people with schizophrenia. We compared it with another treatment called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Both treatments use stimulation to cause a seizure (a short burst of intense electrical activity in the brain) as a way to treat symptoms.\n\n– We are very uncertain about the effects of MST for schizophrenia. This is because we only found one small study, and there were problems with how it was done.\n\n– The one study suggested that MST and ECT may have similar effects on schizophrenia symptoms. It also suggested that MST might cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, because of the problems with the study, we cannot be sure about these findings. More and better research is needed.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia?\n\nSchizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Symptoms can be different for each person but often include:\n\n– hearing voices or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)\n– having strong beliefs that are not based in reality (delusions)\n– feeling withdrawn or having little motivation to do things\n– showing less emotion\n\nHow is schizophrenia treated?\n\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is medicines called antipsychotics. However, these medicines do not work well for everyone.\n\nFor people who do not get better with medicines, doctors may suggest other treatments like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT is a treatment where small electrical currents are passed through the brain to cause a seizure.\n\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer treatment that is similar to ECT. Instead of electrical currents, MST uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if MST is a helpful and safe treatment for people with schizophrenia. We were especially interested in comparing MST with ECT.\n\nWe looked at how the treatments affected:\n– people's overall condition\n– symptoms like hallucinations or feeling withdrawn\n– memory and thinking skills\n– any unwanted effects\n– how many people left the study early\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at MST compared with ECT or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found only one study that included 79 adults with schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks. It compared people who received MST alongside their usual care with people who received ECT alongside their usual care.\n\nThe study found:\n– There was probably little to no difference between MST and ECT for improving the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n– People who had MST may have had fewer problems with their memory and thinking skills compared to those who had ECT.\n– There was probably little to no difference in how many people in each group stopped their treatment early for any reason.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in these results is very low.\n\nThis is because our findings are based on only one small study. There were also serious problems with how the study was done, which means its results may not be reliable. For example, the study was stopped earlier than planned.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and risks of MST for people with schizophrenia. The true effects of MST could be very different from what this one study suggests.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
