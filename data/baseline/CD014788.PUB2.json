    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of GnRH analogues for endometriosis pain?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Medicines called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues) may help reduce pain from endometriosis more than a dummy treatment (a placebo). However, we are not confident in this finding.\n\n– GnRH analogues may cause more unwanted effects, like hot flushes, than a placebo. They may also weaken bones over time, but taking them with other medicines might help protect bones.\n\n– We are not sure about these results because many of the studies we found had problems with how they were done. More and better research is needed to understand the true benefits and risks of these medicines.\n\nWhat is endometriosis?\n\nEndometriosis is a long-term condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. It is a common condition that affects women and girls who have periods.\n\nThe main symptoms of endometriosis are:\n– painful periods\n– pain in the lower tummy or back (pelvic pain)\n– pain during or after sex\n– difficulty getting pregnant\n\nHow is endometriosis pain treated?\n\nThere is no cure for endometriosis, but treatments can help manage the symptoms. Treatment options include:\n– painkillers\n– hormone medicines, such as the contraceptive pill or GnRH analogues\n– surgery to remove the endometriosis tissue\n\nGnRH analogues work by stopping the ovaries from producing the hormone oestrogen, which encourages endometriosis tissue to grow. However, a lack of oestrogen can cause unwanted effects, like hot flushes and weaker bones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if GnRH analogues are better or worse than other treatments, a placebo, or no treatment for endometriosis pain.\n\nWe also wanted to know about their effects on:\n– bone strength\n– quality of life\n– unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at GnRH analogues compared with other treatments, a placebo, or no treatment in women with endometriosis. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 72 studies that included 7355 women.\n\nGnRH analogues compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment)\nAfter 3 months of treatment, GnRH analogues may reduce different types of pain from endometriosis. However, women taking GnRH analogues may be more likely to have hot flushes. We are not confident about these results.\n\nGnRH analogues compared to another medicine called danazol\nWe are very uncertain if GnRH analogues are better or worse than danazol for reducing pain. The evidence was not clear enough to draw any conclusions.\n\nGnRH analogues and bone strength\nTaking GnRH analogues alone for 12 months may weaken bones more than taking them with another medicine designed to protect bones. But we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is low to very low. This is because many of the studies we found were small and had problems with how they were designed and carried out. For example, it was not always clear how women were assigned to different treatment groups.\n\nThis means the results could change when more and better research is done.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022."
