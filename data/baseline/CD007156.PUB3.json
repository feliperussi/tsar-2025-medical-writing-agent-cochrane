    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat treatments help with oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey Messages\n– Oral submucous fibrosis is a long-term condition that causes stiffness and pain in the mouth, making it hard to open the mouth, eat, and speak. It is mainly caused by chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut).\n– Taking antioxidant medicines by mouth probably helps to reduce the burning pain caused by the condition. Antioxidants may also help people open their mouths a little wider, but the improvement may be too small to make a real difference in daily life.\n– We do not know if other treatments for oral submucous fibrosis are helpful or harmful because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis is a condition that affects the inside of the mouth and cheeks. It causes the tissues to become stiff and scarred over time. This can make it very difficult and painful to open the mouth, chew food, and talk.\n\nThe main cause of this condition is chewing areca nut, which is often part of a betel quid. People with oral submucous fibrosis also have a higher risk of developing mouth cancer.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which treatments work best to relieve the symptoms of oral submucous fibrosis. We were interested in how different treatments affected:\n– people's ability to eat, chew, and speak normally\n– how wide people could open their mouths\n– the range of jaw movement\n– feelings of burning pain in the mouth\n– any unwanted effects from the treatments\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested different treatments for adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The treatments could include medicines, surgery, or physical therapy. We looked for studies that compared a treatment with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that included a total of 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nOur main findings are about treatments compared with a placebo or no treatment.\n\nAntioxidants (medicines that can prevent or slow damage to cells)\n– Burning pain: Antioxidants taken as pills or capsules probably reduce the burning feeling in the mouth for at least six months.\n– Mouth opening: Antioxidants may slightly increase how wide people can open their mouths for up to six months. However, this improvement was very small and may not be big enough to be noticed by people with the condition.\n\nOther treatments\nFor other treatments, such as different types of medicines or physical therapy, the evidence was very unclear. We do not know if they help improve symptoms.\n\nUnwanted effects\nSome people who took medicines by mouth had mild stomach problems, like pain, bloating, or feeling sick. One study on a type of surgery found that a few people had serious problems that meant they had to stay in the hospital longer. For most treatments, there was not enough information to know about unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Most of the studies we found had problems in how they were designed or carried out, which could make their results unreliable. Many studies were also very small.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the benefits and harms of most treatments for oral submucous fibrosis. More and better-quality studies are needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
