    "output": "Different ways of feeding after major pancreas surgery: which is best for recovery?\n\nKey messages\n\n– After a major operation on the pancreas, people can be fed in different ways: by mouth, through a tube into the gut (enteral feeding), or through a tube into a vein (parenteral nutrition).\n\n– Giving liquid food through a tube directly into the intestine (a type of enteral feeding called jejunostomy) likely helps people leave the hospital sooner compared to feeding them through a vein.\n\n– For most other ways of feeding, we are not sure if one method is better than another for preventing problems after surgery or shortening hospital stays. This is because there are not enough good studies to be certain.\n\nWhat is a pancreaticoduodenectomy?\n\nThe pancreas is an organ in your belly that helps you digest food and control your blood sugar. Sometimes, people need an operation to remove part of the pancreas, most often because of cancer. This complex operation is called a pancreaticoduodenectomy, or a Whipple procedure.\n\nThis surgery changes how your digestive system works. After the operation, it can be hard for your body to get the nutrition it needs to heal. Not getting enough nutrition (malnutrition) can lead to more problems and a longer recovery. Doctors use different methods to feed people while they are recovering in the hospital.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which way of feeding people after a Whipple procedure is best for their recovery. We looked at how different feeding methods affected:\n\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– problems after surgery, such as leaks from the pancreas, bleeding, or the stomach emptying too slowly\n– death\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after a Whipple procedure. The main methods were:\n\n– eating and drinking normally (oral feeding)\n– feeding through a tube that goes into the gut (enteral feeding)\n– feeding directly into the blood through a vein (parenteral nutrition)\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 17 studies that included 1897 people who had a Whipple procedure.\n\nTube feeding into the intestine versus feeding through a vein\nFour studies compared giving liquid food through a tube in the intestine with giving it through a vein. People who received tube feeding likely went home from the hospital about one and a half days sooner. There may be no difference between the two methods in the risk of problems after surgery, but we are not certain.\n\nTube feeding through the nose versus feeding through a vein\nTwo studies compared feeding through a tube in the nose with feeding through a vein. There may be little to no difference in how long people stayed in the hospital or their risk of most problems. Feeding through a vein might be slightly better at preventing a specific problem where digestive juices leak from the pancreas.\n\nTube feeding into the intestine versus eating normally\nTwo studies compared tube feeding with normal eating and drinking. There may be no difference in how long people stayed in the hospital or their risk of problems after surgery. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nAcross all the studies, there was no clear difference in the number of deaths between any of the feeding methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because most of the studies were small, and some had problems in how they were designed or carried out. This means we cannot be sure about the results. The findings could change when more and better research is done.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
