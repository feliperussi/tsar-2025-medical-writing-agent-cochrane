    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nComparing two surgery techniques for large holes in the back of the eye\n\nKey Messages\n– A macular hole is a small tear in the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. This tear can cause blurry or distorted central vision. It is often treated with surgery.\n– We compared two surgery techniques for large macular holes. The standard technique removes a very thin layer of tissue from around the hole (the 'peeling' technique). A newer technique uses this same tissue to create a small flap to cover the hole (the 'inverted flap' technique).\n– The surgery using the 'inverted flap' technique probably helps the hole to close more often than the standard 'peeling' technique. The 'inverted flap' technique may also lead to better vision 3 months or more after surgery, but we are not very confident about this finding.\n\nWhat is a macular hole?\nThe retina is a thin layer of tissue at the very back of your eye. It senses light and sends signals to your brain, allowing you to see. The macula is the small, central part of the retina that is responsible for sharp, detailed vision. It lets you read, drive, and see faces clearly.\n\nA macular hole is a small break in the macula. This can happen because of aging or an eye injury. When you have a macular hole, your central vision can become blurry, wavy, or distorted. This review looked at 'large' macular holes, which can be more difficult to treat.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nSurgery is the main treatment for a macular hole. A common type of surgery involves removing the gel-like fluid inside the eye and then removing a very thin layer from the surface of the retina around the hole. This is called 'internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling'.\n\nA newer technique involves using this same thin layer to create a tiny flap that is folded over to cover the hole. This is called the 'inverted ILM flap' technique.\n\nWe wanted to find out if the inverted ILM flap technique works better than the standard ILM peeling technique for treating large macular holes.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how well people could see after surgery\n– if the hole in the retina closed successfully\n– any unwanted effects from the surgery, such as the retina pulling away from the back of the eye (retinal detachment)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the inverted ILM flap technique with the standard ILM peeling technique in people with large macular holes.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included 275 people with large macular holes. The studies followed people for between 3 and 12 months after their surgery.\n\nClosing the hole\nThe evidence suggests that the inverted ILM flap technique is probably better at closing large macular holes than the standard ILM peeling technique. People who had the flap surgery were more likely to have their hole close completely.\n\nVision\nAfter 3 months or more, the inverted ILM flap technique may lead to better vision than the standard peeling technique. However, we are not very confident in this result, and more research is needed. We are not sure if there is any difference in vision between the two groups 1 month after surgery.\n\nUnwanted effects\nThe studies did not provide much information about unwanted effects. One study reported that none of the people in either surgery group had a retinal detachment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for several reasons.\n\nThe studies we found were small. There were also some problems with how the studies were carried out. For example, the people who measured vision after the surgery often knew which type of surgery each person had received. This knowledge could have influenced the results. Because of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
