    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\n\nMaturing eggs in the lab (IVM) or in the body (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome: which is better for having a baby?\n\nKey Messages\n\n– For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are having trouble getting pregnant, we are very uncertain if maturing eggs in a lab, a process called in vitro maturation (IVM), affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n– We are confident that IVM greatly reduces the risk of a serious side effect from fertility hormones called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), where the ovaries swell and become painful.\n\n– However, we are also confident that women who have IVM are more likely to have a miscarriage (when a pregnancy ends on its own before 24 weeks) than women who have standard IVF.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is a common health condition caused by a hormone imbalance. It affects women who are able to have children.\n\nPCOS can cause irregular periods, unwanted hair growth, and acne. It can also make it difficult for women to get pregnant because their ovaries may not release eggs regularly.\n\nHow is infertility treated in women with PCOS?\n\nMany women with PCOS who want to have a baby use assisted reproductive technology. One of the most common treatments is in vitro fertilization, known as IVF.\n\nDuring standard IVF, a woman takes high doses of hormones to help many of her eggs mature inside her ovaries. The mature eggs are then collected and fertilized with sperm in a lab. However, for women with PCOS, these high hormone doses can sometimes lead to a painful and dangerous side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nAn alternative approach is in vitro maturation (IVM). With IVM, doctors collect eggs from the ovaries when they are still immature. The eggs are then matured in a lab before being fertilized. This method uses fewer or no hormones, which may lower the risk of OHSS.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which method is better and safer for women with PCOS who are having trouble getting pregnant: IVM or standard IVF.\n\nWe were interested in how these treatments affected:\n– the number of live births\n– the number of miscarriages\n– the number of women who became pregnant\n– the risk of OHSS\n– the risk of babies being born too early\n– the risk of birth defects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared IVM with standard IVF in women with PCOS. We compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 4 studies that included 810 women with PCOS. Our main findings are based on 2 of these studies, which were well-designed and included 739 women.\n\nLive birth\nWe do not know if IVM improves or reduces the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nMiscarriage\nWomen who had IVM were more likely to have a miscarriage than women who had standard IVF.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nIVM greatly reduces the risk of developing moderate or severe OHSS compared to standard IVF.\n\nOther outcomes\nThere was probably little to no difference between IVM and IVF in the risk of babies being born too early. We are uncertain if IVM affects the risk of birth defects because there was not enough information.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. For the most important outcome, live birth, we are very uncertain about the results. This is because the studies found very different results, and two of the four studies we found had problems with how they were done.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to give a clearer answer. We found five studies that are currently in progress.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023."
