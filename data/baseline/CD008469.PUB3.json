    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan education at home help children manage their asthma?\n\nKey Messages\n– We are not sure if education at home helps children with asthma better than usual care. It may slightly improve their quality of life (how they feel about their overall health and well-being), but the evidence is very uncertain.\n– When comparing more-intensive home education to less-intensive home education, the more-intensive programs may lead to fewer children needing to stay in the hospital for their asthma.\n– We need more and better studies to be sure about the best way to provide asthma education for children.\n\nWhat is asthma?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways, which are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. In people with asthma, these airways can become swollen and narrow. This can cause symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. These symptoms can come and go and are sometimes called \"asthma attacks.\"\n\nAsthma is a common condition in children. Learning how to manage it is important. This includes knowing how to use medicines like inhalers, and how to avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack, such as dust or smoke.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education programs delivered in the home help children and their families manage asthma better.\n\nWe compared home-based education with:\n– usual care or education given in other places, like a clinic.\n– less-intensive home-based education (for example, programs with fewer or shorter visits).\n\nWe were interested in how home education affected:\n– asthma attacks that required a visit to hospital emergency care.\n– asthma attacks that required treatment with oral corticosteroids (steroid medicines taken by mouth to reduce swelling in the airways).\n– hospital stays for asthma.\n– a child's quality of life.\n– days missed from school.\n– asthma symptoms.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at home-based asthma education for children aged 2 to 18. The studies had to compare home education with either usual care or a less-intensive home education program.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how big they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that included 5122 children with asthma. The studies looked at children of different ages and with different levels of asthma severity, from mild to severe. The education programs were also very different from each other.\n\nHome education compared to usual care\nWe are very uncertain about the effects of home education compared to usual care. The evidence suggests there may be little or no difference in the number of emergency visits or the need for steroid medicines. Home education may slightly improve a child's quality of life, but we are not confident in this finding. We do not have enough information to know if it affects hospital stays or days missed from school.\n\nMore-intensive home education compared to less-intensive home education\nWhen we compared more-intensive home education programs to less-intensive ones, we found that more-intensive programs may reduce the number of children who need to be admitted to the hospital for their asthma. However, more-intensive programs did not seem to make a difference in the number of emergency visits, the need for steroid medicines, or the number of school days missed.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons. First, the studies we found were very different from one another. They included children of different ages, with different types of asthma, and used many different kinds of education programs. This makes it hard to compare their results.\n\nSecond, there were problems with how some of the studies were done. For example, in most studies, the families and educators knew which type of education they were getting. This knowledge could have affected the results. Because of these issues, our confidence in the findings is low.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
