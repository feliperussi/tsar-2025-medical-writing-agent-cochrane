    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan a TENS machine help with period pain?\n\nKey Messages\n– A TENS machine is a small device that sends gentle electrical pulses to the body through pads placed on the skin. It is a treatment for pain that does not use medicines. TENS stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.\n– Using either a high-frequency or low-frequency TENS machine may help reduce period pain more than a fake (placebo) treatment or no treatment.\n– We are not sure if TENS is better or worse than other treatments for period pain, such as painkillers. We are also not sure if one type of TENS (high-frequency or low-frequency) works better than the other.\n\nWhat is period pain?\nPeriod pain, also known as primary dysmenorrhoea, is cramping pain in the lower belly that many women get before or during their menstrual period. It happens when the wall of the womb tightens. This pain is not caused by another health problem. It can range from mild to severe and can sometimes affect daily activities.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a TENS machine is a good and safe way to treat period pain.\n\nWe were interested in how TENS compared with a fake (placebo) treatment, no treatment, or other common treatments for period pain. We looked at:\n– how much pain relief people felt\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at using a TENS machine compared with a fake TENS machine, no treatment, or other treatments for women with period pain.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that included 585 women with period pain.\n\nTENS compared with a fake treatment or no treatment\nThe evidence suggests that both high-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared with using a fake TENS machine or having no treatment.\n\nHigh-frequency TENS compared with low-frequency TENS\nWe are uncertain if high-frequency TENS works better or worse than low-frequency TENS for reducing period pain.\n\nTENS compared with other treatments\nWe are also uncertain if TENS is better or worse at relieving pain than other treatments, such as painkillers like paracetamol or other therapies.\n\nUnwanted effects\nVery few studies reported on the unwanted effects of TENS. Based on the limited information we have, we are not sure about the unwanted effects of using TENS for period pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the results. This is because most of the studies we found were small. There were also some problems with how the studies were done, which could have affected their results.\n\nBecause of these limitations, future research could change our findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2024."
