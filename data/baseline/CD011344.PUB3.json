    "output": "Automatic injections versus a continuous drip for epidural pain relief during labour\n\nKey messages\n\n– People who received epidural medicine through automatic, timed injections were less likely to have 'breakthrough pain' (pain that needs extra attention from a specialist doctor) compared to those who received it through a continuous drip.\n\n– The automatic injection method also used less pain-relief medicine overall.\n\n– There was likely no difference between the two methods in the number of people who needed a caesarean section or help from instruments like forceps to deliver their baby.\n\nWhat is an epidural for pain relief in labour?\n\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver numbing medicines, called local anaesthetics. These medicines block pain signals from the lower part of the body.\n\nThere are two main ways to deliver this medicine:\n– A continuous drip, also called a basal infusion (BI), where the medicine flows in slowly and constantly.\n– Automatic, timed injections, also called an automated mandatory bolus (AMB), where a pump gives a set amount of medicine at regular times.\n\nOften, people can also press a button to give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it. This is called patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving epidural medicine is better for pain relief during labour: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how many people had breakthrough pain that needed extra treatment\n– how many people had a caesarean section\n– how many people needed help from instruments (like forceps or a vacuum cup) to deliver their baby\n– how satisfied people were with their pain relief\n– how much pain medicine was used\n– any unwanted effects on the baby's health right after birth\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared automatic, timed injections with a continuous drip for people having an epidural during labour.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 18 studies that included 4590 people. Most studies included healthy people having their first baby.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\nPain relief: People who had automatic injections were less likely to experience breakthrough pain compared to those who had a continuous drip. They also used less pain-relief medicine per hour.\n\nType of birth: There was probably no difference between the two methods in how many people had a caesarean section or an instrumental delivery. The length of labour was also likely similar with both methods.\n\nSatisfaction: People who had automatic injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. However, the studies measured satisfaction in different ways, so it was hard to combine their results.\n\nEffects on the baby: All studies that looked at the baby's health right after birth found no difference between the two methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in most of our findings. However, some of the studies did not clearly explain how they decided which person would get which type of epidural. This could slightly lower our confidence in the results.\n\nAlso, while we found no difference in the rates of caesarean or instrumental delivery, we need larger studies to be more certain about this.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
