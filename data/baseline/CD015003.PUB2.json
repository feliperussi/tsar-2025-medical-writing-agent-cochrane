    "output": "Can taking colchicine prevent heart problems for people who have never had them?\n\nKey messages\n\n- We wanted to find out if the medicine colchicine can prevent heart and blood vessel problems in people who do not already have these conditions.\n- We are very uncertain about the effects of colchicine. The available studies do not provide clear answers on whether it prevents death, heart attacks, or strokes.\n- Colchicine may cause unwanted effects, such as diarrhea. Because of the problems with the available studies, much better research is needed before we can know the true benefits and risks of colchicine for preventing heart disease.\n\nWhat is heart and blood vessel disease?\n\nHeart and blood vessel diseases, also called cardiovascular diseases, are a major cause of health problems worldwide. They happen when fatty materials build up inside the arteries, which are the tubes that carry blood around your body. This build-up can make the arteries narrower and harder, making it difficult for blood to flow through.\n\nThis can lead to serious and sudden problems like a heart attack or a stroke. Long-lasting swelling (called inflammation) inside the body can make these diseases worse.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nColchicine is an old and inexpensive medicine that helps reduce inflammation. We wanted to find out if taking colchicine could help prevent heart and blood vessel problems in adults who had not had these problems before.\n\nWe were especially interested in whether colchicine could affect:\n- death from any cause\n- heart attacks that were not fatal\n- strokes\n- any unwanted effects of the medicine\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine with either a dummy pill (a placebo), other medicines, or usual care. The studies had to include adults who did not have a history of heart or blood vessel disease.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 15 studies that included a total of 1721 people. The studies lasted from 4 weeks to about 14 years.\n\nThe evidence from these studies was very unclear for all the things we looked at.\n\nWhen colchicine was compared to a dummy pill, we found that:\n- we do not know if colchicine reduces the risk of dying from any cause.\n- we do not know if colchicine makes any difference to the risk of having a heart attack or a stroke.\n- people taking colchicine may be more likely to get diarrhea.\n\nThere was not enough information to draw clear conclusions when colchicine was compared to other medicines or to usual care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the results. This is for several reasons:\n- Most of the studies had problems with how they were designed and carried out. This means their results may not be reliable.\n- The studies were generally small, which makes the results less certain.\n- Many of the studies included people with specific health conditions, like liver disease. This means the results may not apply to the general population who do not have these conditions.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the benefits or risks of using colchicine to prevent heart and blood vessel disease. We need larger, better-quality studies to answer this question.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
