    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nHow do healthcare workers feel about combining different health services?\n\nKey Messages\n- We looked at research on the views and experiences of healthcare workers when different health services are delivered together. This is called 'integrated primary healthcare'. For example, this could mean a clinic offers both mental health support and care for long-term illnesses like diabetes in the same place.\n- We found 184 studies from 37 different countries. These studies showed that services are combined in many different ways and involve a wide range of healthcare workers, from managers to community health volunteers.\n- This review creates a 'map' of all the existing research on this topic. This map helps us see what we know and what we still need to learn. It will help future researchers ask more specific questions about how to make combined healthcare services work best for everyone.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nPrimary healthcare is the first point of contact you have with the health system. It includes family doctors, nurses, and local clinics. Usually, you might have to visit different places or see different people for different health problems. For example, you might see one doctor for a check-up and go to a different clinic for mental health support.\n\nIntegrated primary healthcare tries to bring these different services together. The goal is to make healthcare simpler and more convenient for patients. It can also help healthcare workers from different areas to work together more closely to support a person's overall health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nHealthcare workers are very important for making integrated care successful. We wanted to find out what kind of research has been done on their experiences and opinions about it.\n\nInstead of trying to find a single answer, our goal was to create a map of all the existing studies. We wanted to understand:\n- what countries the research comes from\n- what types of health services were being combined\n- which healthcare workers were included in the studies\n- what types of patients the services were for\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that reported on healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrated primary healthcare. We looked for studies that used methods like interviews or group discussions to understand people's feelings and opinions.\n\nWe did not combine the results of the studies. Instead, we sorted and described them to create a map of the available research. This helps to show where there is a lot of research and where there are gaps.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different countries. The countries included were a mix of high-, middle-, and low-income nations.\n\nOur main finding was that the research on this topic is very diverse. This means studies looked at many different situations in many different ways.\n\nFor example, studies looked at combining services for:\n- mental and behavioral health\n- HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and sexual health\n- care for mothers, women, and children\n- long-term conditions like diabetes or heart disease\n- general health services\n\nThe studies also included a wide variety of healthcare workers, from senior managers and doctors to nurses, allied health professionals (like physiotherapists), and community health workers.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThis review did not aim to combine the results of the studies to say whether integrated care is 'good' or 'bad' from a healthcare worker's point of view. The main purpose was to map out the research that has already been done.\n\nBecause the studies we found were so different from each other—in the countries they were from, the services they looked at, and the healthcare workers they included—we cannot draw a single conclusion from them. This map is a first step. It will help researchers in the future to group similar studies together to answer more specific questions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020."
