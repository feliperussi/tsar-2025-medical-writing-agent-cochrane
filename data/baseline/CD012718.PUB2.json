    "output": "Can a liquid painted on teeth called silver diamine fluoride help prevent or stop tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that dentists can paint on teeth to help prevent or stop tooth decay, also known as cavities.\n– For older adults, SDF probably helps prevent new cavities from forming on the roots of teeth. For children, it may help stop existing cavities in baby teeth from getting worse.\n– We are not sure if SDF helps prevent cavities on the main surfaces of teeth in children or adults. We also do not have enough reliable information to know if SDF is better or worse than other dental treatments. SDF permanently stains the decayed part of the tooth black.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\n\nTooth decay, also called dental caries or cavities, is a very common disease around the world. It happens when bacteria in your mouth make acid that damages the hard outer layer of your teeth.\n\nIf not treated, tooth decay can cause holes in the teeth, pain, and infection. This can make it hard to eat and can affect a person's general health and well-being.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is effective for preventing and stopping tooth decay in children and adults.\n\nWe looked at how SDF compared with:\n– a pretend treatment (called a placebo) or no treatment at all;\n– other dental treatments, such as fluoride varnish or special fillings;\n– different ways of applying SDF, for example, how often it was used or what strength it was.\n\nWe also wanted to know about any unwanted effects of SDF, such as staining of the teeth.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo, or no treatment in children and adults with or without tooth decay.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 29 studies with a total of 13,036 people. Most of the people in the studies were children.\n\nSDF compared to a placebo or no treatment\n– SDF probably helps prevent new cavities on the roots of teeth. This type of cavity is most common in older adults.\n– SDF may help stop existing cavities in children's baby teeth from getting worse.\n– We are very uncertain if SDF helps prevent cavities on the main biting surfaces of teeth in either children or adults.\n\nSDF compared to other dental treatments\nWe did not find enough reliable evidence to know if SDF is better, worse, or the same as other treatments, like fluoride varnish or certain types of fillings, for preventing or stopping cavities.\n\nUnwanted effects\nThe main unwanted effect of SDF is that it permanently stains the decayed area of the tooth black. The studies did not report clearly on this or other unwanted effects, so we are uncertain about them.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in most of our findings. This is because many of the studies were small, and there were problems with how some of them were carried out. For example, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nBecause of these issues, we cannot be sure about the benefits and risks of SDF for most situations. More and better studies are needed to give us more certain answers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
