    "output": "Does adding a special light therapy to deep cleaning help treat gum disease?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We are very unsure if adding a special light therapy (called antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, or aPDT) to standard deep cleaning helps treat gum disease. Any small improvements seen in studies were likely not big enough to make a real difference for patients.\n\n– The light therapy did not seem to cause any major side effects in most studies that reported them.\n\n– We did not find enough evidence to know if this light therapy helps treat problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are gum disease and problems around dental implants?\n\nGum disease (periodontitis) is a long-term condition where the gums become swollen and sore. If not treated, it can damage the bone that holds teeth in place, which can lead to teeth becoming loose or falling out.\n\nA similar problem can happen around dental implants. This is called peri-implant disease. It causes swelling in the gums around the implant and can lead to loss of the bone that supports it.\n\nThe main cause of these problems is a build-up of harmful bacteria under the gums. The standard treatment is a deep cleaning by a dental professional to remove this bacteria. This is sometimes called 'scaling and root planing'.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if adding a special light therapy (aPDT) to deep cleaning works better than deep cleaning alone for people with gum disease or problems around dental implants.\n\nIn aPDT, a special dye is applied to the infected area. A light is then shone on it, which activates the dye to kill the bacteria.\n\nWe were interested in whether this combination treatment improved:\n– the depth of the pockets between gums and teeth\n– bleeding from the gums\n– how well the gums are attached to the teeth\n– gums shrinking back\n– any unwanted side effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light therapy with deep cleaning alone in adults with gum disease or problems around dental implants.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 50 studies that included 1407 people. Most studies looked at people with gum disease.\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light therapy to deep cleaning improves gum health after 6 months. The studies showed that any differences between the treatments were very small and probably not large enough to be important for patients. This was true for both the initial treatment of gum disease and for long-term maintenance care.\n\nWe found almost no studies looking at light therapy for problems around dental implants. This means we do not know if it helps for this condition.\n\nMost studies that looked at side effects found no problems related to the light therapy. In one study, one person developed a swelling with pus (an abscess), but it was not clear if the light therapy caused it.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the results. This is because most of the studies were very small. There were also problems with how some of the studies were done, which could make the results unreliable.\n\nBecause of these issues, we cannot be sure about the true effects of adding light therapy to deep cleaning. We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
