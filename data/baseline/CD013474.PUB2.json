    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nMedicines to keep chronic lymphocytic leukaemia from coming back: what are the benefits and harms?\n\nKey Messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a slow-growing cancer of the blood, 'maintenance therapy' is treatment given after initial therapy to keep the cancer from returning.\n- Taking certain maintenance medicines probably helps people live longer without their cancer getting worse compared to observation (no treatment). However, these medicines probably do not help people live longer overall.\n- These maintenance medicines may also cause more unwanted effects, some of which can be serious, compared to observation.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia, or CLL, is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. These cells are important for fighting infection. In CLL, the body makes too many of these cells, but they do not work properly.\n\nCLL is a 'chronic' condition, which means it develops slowly over a long time. Many people, especially in the early stages, do not have any symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they can include swollen glands, feeling very tired, and getting infections often.\n\nHow is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated?\nWhen CLL needs treatment, the first round of therapy is meant to get the cancer under control. This is called 'remission'. After a successful first treatment, some people may be offered 'maintenance therapy'. This is an ongoing, lower-dose treatment designed to keep the cancer in remission for as long as possible. The other option is 'observation', which means watching and waiting without active treatment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if maintenance therapy is better than observation for people with CLL who have finished their first treatment.\n\nWe were interested in the effects of maintenance therapy on:\n- how long people lived\n- how long people lived before their cancer got worse\n- people's quality of life\n- serious unwanted effects\n- any unwanted effects\n- how many people stopped treatment because of unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different types of maintenance therapy with either a dummy treatment (placebo) or observation in people with CLL.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The studies lasted from about 1 year to over 6 years.\n\nThe studies looked at three types of maintenance medicines:\n- Medicines called anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (for example, rituximab)\n- Medicines called immunomodulatory drugs (for example, lenalidomide)\n- A medicine called an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (alemtuzumab)\n\nAnti-CD20 medicines (like rituximab) compared to observation\n- These medicines probably help people live longer without their cancer getting worse.\n- They probably make little to no difference in how long people live overall.\n- They may increase the number of serious unwanted effects and all unwanted effects.\n- They may make no difference to people's quality of life.\n\nImmunomodulatory medicines (like lenalidomide) compared to observation\n- These medicines probably help people live much longer without their cancer getting worse.\n- They probably make little to no difference in how long people live overall.\n- They may increase the number of serious unwanted effects and probably increase all unwanted effects.\n\nAnti-CD52 medicine (alemtuzumab) compared to observation\n- Only one very small study looked at this medicine. Because the study was so small, we are very uncertain about its effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited. For some outcomes, there were not enough studies or people to be certain about the findings. Some studies also had problems in how they were designed, which could have affected the results.\n\nWe did not find any studies that looked at newer medicines that are now sometimes used for maintenance therapy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022."
