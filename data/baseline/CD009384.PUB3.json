    "output": "Zinc supplements for children: do they prevent illness and help with growth?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Taking zinc supplements probably helps prevent episodes of diarrhea and may lead to a small increase in height for children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n\n– Zinc supplements likely do not prevent death from any cause. It is uncertain if they prevent deaths from specific illnesses like lung infections (pneumonia) or malaria.\n\n– A common unwanted effect of zinc supplements is vomiting.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency?\n\nZinc is a nutrient that is important for the body to grow and fight infections. When children do not get enough zinc from their food, it is called zinc deficiency.\n\nThis is common in many low- and middle-income countries. Not having enough zinc can put children at risk of getting sick, not growing properly, and even dying.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years could help keep them healthy.\n\nWe looked at whether zinc supplements:\n– prevented death from any cause\n– prevented death from diarrhea, lung infections (like pneumonia), or malaria\n– reduced how often children got sick with diarrhea or lung infections\n– helped children grow taller\n– caused any unwanted effects, such as vomiting\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared zinc supplements with a placebo (a \"dummy\" supplement with no medicine in it) or no treatment.\n\nThe studies included children aged 6 months to 12 years who were not in the hospital and did not have long-term health problems.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many children were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 96 studies that included over 219,000 children. Most studies took place in low- or middle-income countries, and most of the children were younger than 5 years old. The studies usually lasted for about 6 months.\n\n**Death**\nTaking zinc supplements likely makes little to no difference in the number of children who die from any cause. We are uncertain if zinc helps prevent deaths from specific illnesses like diarrhea, lung infections, or malaria.\n\n**Getting sick**\nChildren who took zinc supplements were less likely to get diarrhea. However, zinc did not seem to change how often children got lung infections.\n\n**Growth**\nChildren who took zinc supplements had a small increase in their height compared to those who did not.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\nVomiting was more common in children who took zinc supplements.\n\n**Zinc with other supplements**\nWe also found that when children were given iron supplements at the same time as zinc, the good effects of zinc seemed to be reduced.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are confident in most of our findings, such as the effect of zinc on diarrhea, growth, and vomiting. The studies we found were generally well-conducted.\n\nHowever, we are less certain about whether zinc can prevent deaths from specific illnesses like lung infections or malaria. The results for these questions were not as clear, and more research could change our conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
