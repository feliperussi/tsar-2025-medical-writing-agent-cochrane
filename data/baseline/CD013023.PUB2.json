    "output": "Which dressings work best to stop problems with arterial catheters?\n\nKey messages\n\n– An arterial catheter is a thin tube put into an artery (a blood vessel that carries blood from the heart) to measure blood pressure and take blood samples. It is held in place with a dressing.\n– We are very uncertain if one type of dressing or device is better than another for stopping arterial catheters from failing or causing problems like infections.\n– This is because there are not enough good-quality studies. More research is needed to help doctors and nurses decide which dressings are best to use.\n\nWhat is an arterial catheter?\n\nWhen people are very ill in the hospital, for example in an intensive care unit, doctors and nurses need to closely watch their blood pressure. They also need to take blood samples often. To do this, they can place a thin, flexible plastic tube called an arterial catheter into an artery, usually in the wrist.\n\nTo keep the catheter in place and keep the area clean, a dressing is put over it. Sometimes, the catheter can stop working, get blocked, or fall out. This means it needs to be replaced, which can be uncomfortable. There is also a small risk of the catheter causing a serious bloodstream infection.\n\nDifferent types of dressings and devices are used to hold the catheter in place and prevent these problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which dressings or devices work best to prevent arterial catheters from failing or causing other problems.\n\nWe were interested in how different dressings affected:\n– catheter failure (when the catheter had to be removed because it was not working)\n– bloodstream infections caused by the catheter\n– the catheter accidentally falling out\n– the catheter getting blocked\n- any other unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different types of dressings and devices used to secure arterial catheters in people in the hospital.\n\nThe main types of dressings we looked at were:\n– standard clear plastic dressings\n– standard dressings with a special skin glue added\n– clear plastic dressings with a sticky border\n– standard dressings with special clips or sticky pads to hold the catheter (instead of stitches)\n– dressings with a built-in device to hold the catheter\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 5 studies that included a total of 1228 people with arterial catheters.\n\nThe studies compared different dressings, but we did not find any clear evidence that one type was better than another at preventing catheter failure or other problems. For all the dressings we looked at, we are very uncertain about their effects. This means we do not know if they make a difference to the number of catheters that fail, cause infections, get blocked, or fall out.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is because most of the studies were very small. There were also problems with how some of the studies were done, which could make their results unreliable.\n\nBecause problems like infections did not happen very often in the studies, it was hard to tell if any dressing made a real difference. We need more and better studies to be more certain about which dressings are best for arterial catheters.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
