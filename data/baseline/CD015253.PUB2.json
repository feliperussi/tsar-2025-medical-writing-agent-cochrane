    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes a special balloon technique help treat 'glue ear' in children?\n\nKey Messages\n– Glue ear is a common childhood condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, which can affect hearing. Autoinflation is a treatment where a child uses a special device, like a nasal balloon, to help clear this fluid.\n– When compared to no treatment, autoinflation may slightly improve a child's quality of life and may help the fluid clear up a bit faster. However, we are very unsure if it helps hearing return to normal or if it causes side effects like ear pain.\n– We have very little confidence in these results because of problems with how the studies were done. More and better research is needed to understand if autoinflation is truly helpful for children with glue ear.\n\nWhat is glue ear?\nGlue ear, also known as otitis media with effusion (OME), is a common condition in young children. It happens when sticky fluid builds up in the space behind the eardrum, called the middle ear.\n\nThis fluid can make it harder for children to hear properly. If the condition lasts for a long time, it can sometimes lead to problems with a child's speech and behaviour.\n\nWhat is autoinflation?\nAutoinflation is a technique that children can do themselves, with help from an adult, to try and clear the fluid from their middle ear.\n\nIt usually involves using a special device, such as a balloon that is blown up using the nose. This creates pressure that helps to open a small tube connecting the ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube). Opening this tube can help the fluid drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if autoinflation is a helpful and safe treatment for children with glue ear. We compared autoinflation with providing no treatment (also known as 'watchful waiting').\n\nWe were especially interested in how autoinflation affected:\n– a child's hearing\n– their quality of life (how glue ear affects their daily life)\n– any pain or distress caused by the treatment\n– whether the fluid in the ear cleared up\n– any other unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at autoinflation compared with no treatment in children with glue ear. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 1036 children with glue ear. Most children in the studies were between 3 and 11 years old. In the studies, children used autoinflation devices two or three times a day for a few weeks or months.\n\nHere is what we found when comparing autoinflation to no treatment:\n\nHearing\nWe are very uncertain if autoinflation helps children's hearing return to normal.\n\nQuality of life\nAutoinflation may slightly improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems in the short term.\n\nPain\nThe treatment might cause ear pain for some children, but we are very unsure about this because there was not enough information.\n\nClearing the fluid\nAutoinflation may help the fluid in the middle ear clear up a bit faster.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the results of this review. This is because most of the studies we found were small, and there were problems with how some of them were carried out.\n\nThis means that the true effects of autoinflation could be very different from what these studies suggest. Therefore, we cannot be sure about the benefits and risks of using autoinflation for glue ear in children.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
