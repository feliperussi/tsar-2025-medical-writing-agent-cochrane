    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\n\nWhat are the effects of having family members present during resuscitation?\n\nKey Messages\n\n– We are very uncertain about the effects of offering family members the choice to be present when a relative is being resuscitated. Resuscitation is an emergency procedure to try and save someone's life when their heart or breathing has stopped.\n\n– There is some suggestion that being present may reduce the risk of relatives developing long-term stress problems, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after a very stressful event. However, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be sure about this.\n\n– We found no evidence that having family present affected the medical care the patient received or increased the stress of healthcare staff, but we cannot be certain about this either.\n\nWhat is resuscitation?\n\nResuscitation is emergency medical care given to someone who has a life-threatening problem, such as their heart stopping (a cardiac arrest) or a serious injury. The goal is to keep them alive. This care often happens in a hospital emergency department or before the patient gets to the hospital, for example, in an ambulance.\n\nIt can be a very stressful and upsetting situation for the patient's family members. Traditionally, family members have not been in the room during resuscitation. However, some hospitals and ambulance services are now offering family members the choice to be present.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out what effect offering family members the choice to be present during a relative's resuscitation has on:\n\n– the mental health of the relatives, especially their risk of developing PTSD, anxiety, or depression;\n– the patient's chances of survival;\n– the medical care given by the healthcare team; and\n– the stress levels of the doctors and nurses involved.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared what happened when relatives were offered the choice to be present during resuscitation with what happened when they were not.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 595 relatives. The studies followed the relatives for up to one year after the resuscitation.\n\nThe larger study suggested that relatives who were offered the choice to be present had fewer symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression a year later compared to relatives who were not offered the choice.\n\nOne study also looked at the effect on the medical team. It found that having family in the room did not seem to change how long the resuscitation took or how stressed the healthcare staff felt.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the results.\n\nThis is because we only found two studies, and we had concerns about the way they were carried out. These problems could mean that the results are not reliable.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits or risks of having family members present during resuscitation. We need more and better studies to answer this question properly.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
