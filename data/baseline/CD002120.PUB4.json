    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of using the combined oral contraceptive pill for painful periods?\n\nKey Messages\n– The combined oral contraceptive pill (often called \"the pill\") reduces pain from menstrual cramps more than a dummy pill (placebo).\n– However, the pill can cause unwanted effects. Compared to a dummy pill, it increases the chance of having irregular bleeding between periods and probably increases the chance of headaches and feeling sick (nausea).\n– Taking the pill continuously without a break may be better for reducing pain than taking it the standard way (with a 7-day break). We do not have enough information to know if the pill is better or worse than other pain medicines like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\n\nWhat are painful periods?\nPainful periods, also known as primary dysmenorrhoea, are cramping pains in the lower belly that happen before or during a menstrual period. It is a very common problem for women. This type of period pain is not caused by other medical conditions like endometriosis or fibroids.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if the combined oral contraceptive pill helps to relieve painful periods. We also wanted to know if it causes any unwanted effects.\n\nWe were interested in how the pill affected:\n– pain levels\n– overall improvement in pain\n– unwanted effects, such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea\n– the need to take extra pain medicine\n– time missed from work or school\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the combined oral contraceptive pill compared with a dummy pill, another type of pill, or other pain medicines like NSAIDs. The studies included women who had painful periods that were not caused by another health condition.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included 3723 women with painful periods. The studies lasted for different amounts of time, usually for a few months.\n\nThe pill compared with a dummy pill\n– Women who took the pill had less period pain than women who took a dummy pill.\n– Women taking the pill were more likely to have unwanted effects. They had a higher chance of irregular bleeding between periods. They also probably had a higher chance of headaches and feeling sick. We are not sure if the pill affects weight gain.\n– Women who took the pill may have needed less extra pain medicine and may have missed less time from work.\n\nOne type of pill compared with another\n– Taking the pill continuously (every day without a break) may reduce pain more than taking it the standard way (3 weeks of pills followed by a 1-week break).\n– Taking the pill the standard way may cause more unwanted effects, especially irregular bleeding, than taking it continuously.\n– We did not find enough information to know if different doses or types of hormones in the pill made a difference to pain.\n\nThe pill compared with NSAIDs (pain relievers)\n– We found only one small study that compared the pill with NSAIDs.\n– We do not have enough information to say whether the pill or NSAIDs work better for treating painful periods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results varies. We are confident that the pill reduces pain more than a dummy pill. However, for some other findings, our confidence is lower. This is because some studies were very small or were not conducted in the best way.\n\nFor example, we are not very confident about the risk of serious unwanted effects. We also need more research to know if taking the pill continuously is safe over a long time. The studies we found did not look at long-term effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
