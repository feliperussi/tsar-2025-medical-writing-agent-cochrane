    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and harms of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for IgA nephropathy?\n\nKey Messages\n– For people with IgA nephropathy (a type of kidney disease), certain blood pressure medicines called RAS inhibitors probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine. High levels of protein in the urine are a sign of kidney damage. We are less sure if these medicines prevent kidney failure.\n– Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine for some people. However, the studies were only done in Japanese people, so we do not know if this treatment would help people of other ethnicities.\n– For other treatments that do not suppress the immune system, such as blood thinners, fish oil, or herbal medicines, there is not enough good information to know if they are helpful for IgA nephropathy.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy is a long-term condition that affects the kidneys. It happens when a protein made by the immune system, called immunoglobulin A (IgA), builds up in the kidneys. This buildup causes damage over time.\n\nThe condition develops slowly, but for some people, it can lead to kidney failure over many years. Common signs include blood or protein in the urine, which a doctor can find with tests.\n\nHow is IgA nephropathy treated?\nSome treatments for IgA nephropathy work by weakening the body's immune system to stop it from attacking the kidneys. However, these treatments can have serious side effects.\n\nThis review looked at treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These include:\n– medicines to lower blood pressure\n– surgery to remove the tonsils\n– blood thinners (medicines that help prevent blood clots)\n– fish oil supplements\n– traditional Chinese medicines\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy.\n\nWe were especially interested in how these treatments affected:\n– kidney failure\n– the amount of protein in the urine\n– the amount of blood in the urine\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments with a fake treatment (a placebo), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 people with IgA nephropathy.\n\nBlood pressure medicines\nMedicines called RAS inhibitors were the most studied treatment. Compared to a fake treatment or no treatment, RAS inhibitors probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine. We are not sure if they prevent kidney failure because the studies did not look at this for long enough. These medicines may not cause any more unwanted effects than a fake treatment.\n\nRemoving the tonsils (tonsillectomy)\nSurgery to remove the tonsils may help some people get rid of protein and blood in their urine. It may also reduce the chance of these problems coming back. However, these studies were only done in Japan. This means we do not know if the results would be the same for people from other parts of the world.\n\nOther treatments\nFor other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines, we did not find enough evidence to be sure if they help improve kidney health compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for several reasons. Many of the studies we found were small and did not last long enough to measure important long-term effects like kidney failure.\n\nThere were also problems with how some of the studies were carried out. Because of these issues, we cannot be certain about many of the findings. More and better research is needed to understand the best way to treat IgA nephropathy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2023."
