    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes oestrogen therapy help treat pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause?\n\nKey Messages\n– We do not know if oestrogen therapy used on its own helps with symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women who have gone through menopause. This is because we did not find any studies that looked at this. Oestrogen is a hormone that decreases after menopause.\n\n– When used with a vaginal pessary (a device put into the vagina to support the pelvic organs), oestrogen given as a cream or gel may reduce vaginal problems like dryness or irritation compared to using a pessary alone.\n\n– When used before and after surgery for prolapse, oestrogen may reduce the risk of getting a urinary tract infection (often called a bladder infection) after the operation. However, we are not confident in these findings because of problems with how the studies were done.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a condition where the organs in a woman's pelvis, such as the bladder, womb (uterus), or bowel, slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina.\n\nThis can happen when the muscles and tissues that support these organs become weak. It is a common condition, affecting about half of all women over 50 who have had at least one child. The main symptoms include a feeling of heaviness or a bulge in the vagina, problems with bladder or bowel control, and discomfort during sex.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nAfter menopause, women have lower levels of the hormone oestrogen, which can affect the strength of the tissues in the pelvis. We wanted to find out if using oestrogen therapy helps improve symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause.\n\nWe also wanted to know if oestrogen therapy caused any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared oestrogen therapy with no treatment, a dummy treatment (placebo), or other treatments for pelvic organ prolapse. The women in the studies had all gone through menopause.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and planned to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1002 women.\n\nThe studies did not look at oestrogen therapy on its own. Instead, they looked at what happened when oestrogen was added to other common treatments for prolapse.\n\nOestrogen with a vaginal pessary\nThree studies compared using oestrogen cream or gel with a vaginal pessary to using a pessary alone. The results suggest that adding oestrogen may lead to fewer vaginal problems, such as dryness, bleeding, or ulcers.\n\nOestrogen with surgery\nEleven studies looked at using oestrogen before and after surgery for prolapse compared to having surgery alone. The results suggest that women who used oestrogen were less likely to get a urinary tract infection after their operation.\n\nWe did not find enough information to say whether oestrogen therapy helped with the main symptoms of prolapse, such as the feeling of a bulge.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is because there were problems with how most of the studies were done. For example, in many studies, the women and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nThe studies were also very different from each other, which made it hard to compare their findings. Because of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the benefits or unwanted effects of using oestrogen for pelvic organ prolapse. More and better-quality research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
