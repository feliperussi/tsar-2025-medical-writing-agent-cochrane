    "output": "Can education programmes help people who have both chronic kidney disease and diabetes manage their health?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Education programmes that teach people how to manage their health probably help lower long-term blood sugar levels (measured by a blood test called HbA1c).\n\n– These programmes may also help lower cholesterol levels and improve people's knowledge and confidence in managing their diabetes. However, we are less certain about these effects.\n\n– We do not know if education programmes affect serious health problems like kidney failure or death because there was not enough information from the studies.\n\nWhat are chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\n\nChronic kidney disease, or CKD, is a long-term condition where the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as well as they should.\n\nDiabetes is a long-term condition where the body cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood. High blood sugar over many years can damage organs, including the kidneys.\n\nMany people have both CKD and diabetes. Living with both conditions can be difficult. People need to manage their diet, medicines, and blood sugar levels very carefully to stay as healthy as possible.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if special education programmes help people with both CKD and diabetes manage their health better than their usual care.\n\nWe were interested in how these programmes affected:\n– blood sugar control\n– cholesterol levels\n\n– knowledge about their conditions\n– confidence in managing their health\n– kidney failure\n– death\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at education programmes compared with usual care for adults with both CKD and diabetes. Education programmes involved a healthcare provider giving information and advice. This could be done through talking, writing, audio recordings, or computers.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies that included a total of 840 people with CKD and diabetes. The studies lasted for about 1 year.\n\nThe studies showed that compared to usual care, education programmes:\n– probably lower long-term blood sugar levels.\n– may help lower total cholesterol and 'bad' cholesterol (also called LDL cholesterol).\n– may improve people's knowledge about diabetes and their confidence in managing it.\n– may help people make positive changes to their diet and blood sugar monitoring in the short term, but these changes might not last.\n\nThe studies did not provide enough information for us to know if education programmes affect the risk of death, serious low blood sugar, or kidney failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only a small number of studies, and most of them did not include many people. Because of this, we cannot be certain about the results. More and larger studies are needed to better understand how education programmes can help people with CKD and diabetes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
