    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nMedicines to clear mucus for children with a long-term wet cough: do they help?\n\nKey Messages\n– Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a long-term lung condition that causes a wet, chesty cough in children. Mucolytics are medicines that help thin and clear mucus from the lungs.\n– We found only one small study that looked at using a mucolytic for children with a type of CSLD called bronchiectasis. The study compared a salty mist breathed in through a machine (called nebulised hypertonic saline) with no salty mist.\n– The results from this one study suggest that the salty mist might reduce the number of flare-ups and improve how well children's lungs work. However, we are very uncertain about these results because the study was small and had problems with how it was done.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease?\nChronic suppurative lung disease, or CSLD, is a name for a group of long-term lung conditions in children. These conditions cause swelling and infection in the airways, which leads to a build-up of mucus.\n\nThe main symptom is a wet, chesty cough that lasts for more than 4 weeks. CSLD includes conditions like bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis. These conditions can cause flare-ups (called exacerbations) where the cough and other symptoms get worse.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if mucolytics (medicines to clear mucus) are better than a dummy treatment (placebo) or no treatment for children with CSLD.\n\nWe were especially interested in whether mucolytics could:\n– reduce the number of flare-ups\n– improve how well children's lungs work\n– improve children's quality of life\n– cause any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared a mucolytic medicine with a placebo or no treatment in children with CSLD.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies we found. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many children were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one study that matched what we were looking for. The study included 52 children with bronchiectasis, a type of CSLD. The children were around 9 years old.\n\nThe study lasted for 8 weeks. It compared children who used a special salty mist (called hypertonic saline) before their chest physiotherapy with children who only had chest physiotherapy. Chest physiotherapy is a set of techniques to help clear mucus from the lungs.\n\nThe study found that children who used the salty mist had fewer flare-ups of their lung condition compared to those who did not. The children who used the salty mist also had better results on breathing tests, which measure how well the lungs are working.\n\nThe study did not report on quality of life. It said that no children stopped the treatment because of unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are very uncertain about these results.\n\nOur confidence is low because our findings are based on only one small study. There were also problems with how the study was done. For example, the people in the study knew which treatment they were getting, and some information was missing from the results. These issues could have affected the results, making them less reliable.\n\nWe need more and better studies to know for sure if mucolytics help children with CSLD.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2024."
