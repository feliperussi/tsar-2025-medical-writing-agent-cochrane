    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan a medicine injected into the eye before surgery help treat vision problems caused by diabetes?\n\nKey Messages\n– For people having eye surgery for advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of a medicine called anti-VEGF into the eye before or during the operation probably reduces bleeding inside the eye after surgery and may improve vision.\n– The injection also reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation.\n– We are not sure if having the injection reduces the need for more surgery later on.\n\nWhat is diabetic eye disease?\nDiabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the body, including those in the eye. When the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) are damaged, it is called diabetic retinopathy.\n\nIn the advanced stage, called proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the eye grows new, weak blood vessels. These can bleed into the jelly-like substance that fills the eye (the vitreous). They can also create scar tissue that pulls on the retina, causing it to detach. Both of these problems can cause severe vision loss.\n\nHow are these problems treated?\nWhen bleeding or a detached retina happens, a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy may be needed. During a vitrectomy, a surgeon removes the blood and jelly-like substance from the eye and repairs any damage to the retina.\n\nHowever, problems can happen during and after this surgery, such as more bleeding or tears in the retina. This can lead to poor vision and the need for more operations.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if injecting a medicine called anti-VEGF into the eye before or during vitrectomy surgery helps improve the results for people with advanced diabetic eye disease. Anti-VEGF medicines work by shrinking the weak, abnormal blood vessels.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– vision 6 months after surgery\n– bleeding inside the eye shortly after surgery\n– bleeding inside the eye more than a month after surgery\n– the need for more surgery\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection with vitrectomy surgery to having vitrectomy surgery alone. The people in the studies had vision problems caused by advanced diabetic eye disease.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The studies took place in many different countries around the world.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– Vision: People who had the anti-VEGF injection may have had better vision 6 months after surgery compared to those who only had surgery.\n– Bleeding soon after surgery: The injection probably reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n– Bleeding later on: The injection reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery.\n– Retinal tears during surgery: The injection reduces the risk of tears in the retina happening during the operation.\n– Need for more surgery: We are not sure if the injection reduces the need for more surgery to treat bleeding or a detached retina. The results from the studies were not clear.\n– No studies reported on how the treatment affected people's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because of some problems with how the studies were done. In many studies, the people taking part and the doctors treating them knew who had received the injection and who had not. This could have affected the results. For some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
