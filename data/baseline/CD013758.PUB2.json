    "output": "Does the amount of protein in infant formula affect a baby's growth and health?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We are very unsure if giving babies formula with high protein compared to standard protein affects their growth in the first year. We are also very unsure if it affects their chances of becoming overweight later in childhood.\n\n– We are also very unsure if giving babies formula with standard protein compared to low protein affects their growth.\n\n– There may be little to no difference in the risk of side effects, like diarrhea or vomiting, between formulas with different amounts of protein.\n\nWhy is protein in infant formula important?\n\nMany babies are fed with infant formula instead of, or in addition to, breast milk. Formula contains important nutrients to help babies grow and stay healthy. Protein is one of the most important nutrients for growth.\n\nSome formulas have higher amounts of protein. The idea is that this might help babies gain weight faster. However, we are not sure if higher protein levels are better for babies or if they could cause any problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if the amount of protein in infant formula makes a difference to a baby's health.\n\nWe compared formulas with three different levels of protein: high, standard, and low. We were interested in how different protein levels affected:\n\n– a baby's growth in the first year, such as being underweight or not growing tall enough\n– the chances of a child being overweight or having obesity later on\n– any unwanted effects, like diarrhea, vomiting, or allergic reactions to milk\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at different protein levels in formula given to healthy, full-term babies.\n\nWe looked for studies that compared:\n– high-protein formula with standard-protein formula\n– standard-protein formula with low-protein formula\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many babies were included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies to include in our review.\n\n**High-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula**\nThis comparison included 7 studies with 1629 babies. The results suggest that using high-protein formula may make little to no difference to a baby's growth in the first year. We are very unsure about this finding.\n\nWe are also very unsure if high-protein formula affects a child's chances of being overweight or having obesity later in life. There was probably little to no difference in the number of unwanted effects, like diarrhea or vomiting, between the two groups.\n\n**Standard-protein formula compared to low-protein formula**\nThis comparison included 4 studies with 256 babies. The results suggest that using standard-protein formula may make little to no difference to a baby's growth in the first year compared to low-protein formula. We are very unsure about this finding.\n\nThese studies did not report on whether the protein level affected the chances of being overweight later in life. There was probably little to no difference in the number of unwanted effects between the two groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in most of the evidence we found. This is because there were problems with how some of the studies were done. Many of the studies were also very small.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the benefits or harms of using formulas with different amounts of protein. More and better research is needed to give us a clearer answer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
