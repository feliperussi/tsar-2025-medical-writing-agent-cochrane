    "output": "Does exercise help people with pain at the front of the knee (patellar tendinopathy)?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Patellar tendinopathy is a common condition that causes pain at the front of the knee, just below the kneecap. It is often called \"jumper's knee.\"\n– We looked at studies to see if strengthening exercises helped people with this condition compared to no treatment, steroid injections (called glucocorticoid injections), or surgery.\n– We have very little confidence in the evidence. We do not know if strengthening exercises are better, worse, or the same as these other options for improving pain or knee function. The findings only apply to athletes.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy?\n\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common injury that causes pain in the tendon that connects your kneecap to your shinbone. This tendon helps you straighten your leg. The condition is often caused by overusing the knee in activities that involve a lot of running and jumping, which is why it is often called \"jumper's knee.\" The main symptom is pain at the front of the knee that gets worse with activity.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if strengthening exercises help people with patellar tendinopathy. We were interested in how exercise affected:\n\n– pain\n– knee function (the ability to do daily activities)\n– whether people felt their treatment was successful\n– returning to sport\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at strengthening exercises compared with no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery in people with patellar tendinopathy. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 7 studies that included 211 people. Most of the people in the studies were young male athletes who had knee pain for a long time.\n\n**Strengthening exercise compared to no treatment**\nWe are very uncertain if exercise helps reduce pain compared to doing nothing. Exercise may make little or no difference to how well people can use their knee.\n\n**Strengthening exercise compared to steroid injections**\nExercise may make little or no difference to pain or knee function when compared to getting a steroid injection.\n\n**Strengthening exercise compared to surgery**\nWe are very uncertain if exercise is better or worse than surgery for reducing pain or improving knee function. Exercise may make little or no difference to whether people felt their treatment was successful or if they were able to return to their sport.\n\nNone of the studies reported on unwanted effects of the treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the results. This is because:\n\n– The studies included only a small number of people, which makes the results less reliable.\n– There were problems with how some of the studies were done. For example, in all studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n– All the people in the studies were athletes. This means the findings may not apply to other people who have patellar tendinopathy but are not athletes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
