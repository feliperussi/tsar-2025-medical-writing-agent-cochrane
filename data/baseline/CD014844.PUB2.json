    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nPreventative antibiotics for women having a procedure after a miscarriage: do they reduce the risk of infection?\n\nKey Messages\n– For women having a procedure to manage a miscarriage, taking antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections) as a precaution likely reduces the risk of getting an infection in the womb. This finding is based on the best-quality studies we found.\n\n– The antibiotics probably do not cause more vomiting or diarrhoea. They may slightly increase the risk of a mild allergic reaction, but we are not sure about this.\n\n– We are very uncertain if taking these preventative antibiotics reduces the need for more treatment or a hospital stay for infection later on.\n\nWhat is a miscarriage?\nA miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before 24 weeks. It is also sometimes called an early pregnancy loss.\n\nAfter a miscarriage, some pregnancy tissue can be left in the womb (uterus). A minor surgical procedure, called a uterine evacuation, is often done to remove this tissue. Like any procedure, there is a small risk of getting an infection afterwards.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nDoctors know that women who already have an infection need antibiotics. However, it is less clear if women without an infection should be given antibiotics as a precaution before a uterine evacuation procedure to prevent an infection from developing.\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving these preventative antibiotics is better than giving a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how many women got an infection in their womb\n– any unwanted effects of the antibiotics, like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions\n– how many women needed to be admitted to hospital for an infection\n– how many women needed more antibiotics later to treat an infection\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preventative antibiotics with giving a placebo or no treatment to women having a procedure for a miscarriage.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 4371 women.\n\nWhen we looked at all 6 studies together, we were not sure if antibiotics helped prevent womb infections. This was because some of the studies had problems with how they were carried out.\n\nHowever, when we looked only at the 3 best-quality studies, which included most of the women, the results were clearer. This stronger evidence showed that women who took preventative antibiotics were less likely to get a womb infection after their procedure compared to women who did not.\n\nOnly one large study looked at unwanted effects.\n– Women who took antibiotics were not more likely to have vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– Women who took antibiotics may have been slightly more likely to have a mild allergic reaction, but we are not confident about this finding. No women had a severe allergic reaction.\n\nWe are very uncertain if taking preventative antibiotics reduces the need for more antibiotic treatment or a hospital stay for an infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in some of the results is limited. This is because some of the studies were not conducted very well. For example, in some studies, many women did not return for their follow-up appointments, so we do not know what happened to them. In other studies, many women who were supposed to take the antibiotics did not.\n\nHowever, we are confident in the results from the three largest and best-run studies, which showed that antibiotics likely do help prevent womb infections. We need more research on the possible unwanted effects of antibiotics.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023."
