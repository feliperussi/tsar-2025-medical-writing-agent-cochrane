    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan special glues or gels help stop bleeding during blood vessel surgery?\n\nKey Messages\n– During surgery to join blood vessels, using special glues or gels called sealants may help stop bleeding faster than standard methods like applying pressure.\n– Sealants may also be more successful at stopping the bleeding, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n– We are not sure if using sealants makes a difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, how long the operation takes, or the risk of bleeding problems after surgery.\n\nWhat is bleeding during blood vessel surgery?\nBlood vessel surgery, also called vascular surgery, is done to fix problems with arteries and veins. During these operations, surgeons sometimes need to connect blood vessels or artificial tubes together. This connection is called an anastomosis.\n\nWhen the surgeon stitches the connection, the needle holes can sometimes bleed. Usually, this bleeding stops on its own or with simple methods like applying pressure. However, sometimes the bleeding is difficult to control.\n\nHow is this bleeding stopped?\nTo stop bleeding from a new connection, surgeons can use standard methods like pressing on the area with a sponge. They can also use special glues or gels called sealants. The surgeon applies the sealant directly to the bleeding area to help seal the needle holes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using sealants is better than standard methods for stopping bleeding where blood vessels are joined during surgery.\n\nWe were interested in how sealants affected:\n– how long it took to stop the bleeding\n– whether the method failed to stop the bleeding\n– the amount of blood lost during the operation\n– how long the operation took\n– bleeding problems in the 30 days after the operation\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at using sealants compared with standard methods like applying pressure in people having blood vessel surgery. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that included a total of 2376 people. The studies compared using a sealant to standard methods for stopping bleeding.\n\nOur main findings were:\n– Using a sealant may help stop bleeding more quickly than standard methods.\n– Sealants may also be more likely to stop the bleeding successfully, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n– We found no clear difference between sealants and standard methods for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the operation took, or the risk of needing another operation for bleeding.\n\nThe studies did not provide information on whether sealants affected people's quality of life or their risk of death from bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is low. This is because there were problems with how all of the studies were done. For example, in many studies, the medical teams knew which treatment the person was getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the findings. Future studies that are better designed could give us more reliable answers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
