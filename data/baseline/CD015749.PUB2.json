    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan combining different treatments help people with cachexia?\n\nKey Messages\n– Cachexia is a condition that causes serious weight loss, muscle loss, and tiredness. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses like cancer or heart disease.\n– We looked at studies that combined different types of treatments for cachexia, such as medicines, diet changes, and exercise programs.\n– We do not know if using a combination of treatments helps or harms people with cachexia. The studies we found were too small and had problems in how they were done, so we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat is cachexia?\nCachexia is a serious condition that is sometimes called 'wasting syndrome'. It causes people to lose a lot of weight and muscle, even if they are still eating. It is not the same as normal weight loss.\n\nCachexia happens to people who have long-term (chronic) illnesses, such as cancer, heart failure, kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. People with cachexia often feel very tired, lose their appetite, and have a lower quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a combination of treatments is better than usual care or just one treatment for people with cachexia.\n\nWe were interested in how these combined treatments affected:\n– physical ability (for example, how far someone can walk)\n– muscle strength\n– body weight and muscle mass\n– quality of life\n– appetite\n– tiredness (fatigue)\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared combined treatments with usual care, a different version of the combined treatment, or a single treatment. The combined treatments included at least two of the following: medicines, special diets or supplements, and exercise.\n\nThe studies included adults with cachexia caused by a long-term illness. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 926 people. Most people in the studies had cancer, but some had other long-term illnesses. The studies lasted from six weeks to seven months.\n\nThe studies compared combined treatments to:\n– usual care\n– a different combination of treatments\n– a single treatment (like only exercise or only diet changes)\n\nOur review of these studies found that it is unclear if combined treatments make any difference to people's physical ability, strength, body weight, appetite, or tiredness. It was also unclear if they caused any unwanted effects. The results from the studies were not clear enough to show a benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because most of the studies were very small. There were also problems with how some of the studies were carried out, which could make their results less reliable. Because of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the effects of combined treatments for cachexia. More and better research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
