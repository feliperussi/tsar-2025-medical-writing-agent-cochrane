    "output": "How accurate are toe blood pressure tests for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries that carry blood to the legs become narrow, reducing blood flow.\n– Health workers sometimes use simple tests that measure blood pressure in the toes to check for PAD. These tests are called the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP).\n– We are very uncertain about how accurate these tests are because the studies we found were small and had problems in how they were done. More and better research is needed to understand how well these tests work.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\n\nPeripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a common condition that affects the blood vessels, usually in the legs. It happens when fatty deposits build up inside the arteries, making them narrower. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow to the leg muscles and feet.\n\nPeople with PAD may have no symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, they can include painful cramping in the legs when walking, which goes away with rest. In more serious cases, PAD can cause pain even when resting, sores that do not heal, and can sometimes lead to the need to remove a toe, foot, or part of theleg (amputation).\n\nFinding and treating PAD early is important to prevent these serious problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how accurate two tests are for diagnosing PAD in adults:\n– toe-brachial index (TBI)\n– toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)\n\nThese tests measure the blood pressure in the big toe. We wanted to know how well these tests could correctly identify people who have PAD and correctly identify people who do not have PAD.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the results of TBI or TSBP tests with the results of more detailed imaging tests. These imaging tests, like special ultrasounds or X-rays of the blood vessels, are the most reliable ways to know for sure if someone has PAD.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 18 studies that met our requirements. The TBI test was looked at in 1927 people, and the TSBP test was looked at in 701 people.\n\nThe studies we found were generally small and had problems with their methods. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from their results. Because of these issues, we are very uncertain about how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing PAD. The results from the studies may not be reliable.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low. This is because most of the studies we found had weaknesses that could have affected their results.\n\nFor example, many studies did not clearly explain how they chose the people to include. It was also often unclear if the person doing the toe pressure test knew the results of the more detailed imaging test beforehand, which could have influenced the outcome.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure how well TBI and TSBP tests work in practice. Future studies that are larger and better designed are needed to give us a clearer answer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
