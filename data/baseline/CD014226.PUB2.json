It is called 'complex' because the bulge is very close to the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys and other organs.\n– We wanted to find out if a special type of stent graft (a tube placed inside the blood vessel) called FEVAR is better or worse than open surgery or no surgery for treating these complex bulges.\n– We did not find any suitable studies to answer this question. This means we do not know from high-quality research which treatment is best for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm?\nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It carries blood from your heart down through your chest and tummy (abdomen). Sometimes, a weak spot in the wall of the aorta can bulge outwards, like a balloon. This is called an aneurysm.\n\nWhen this happens in the part of the aorta that runs through your tummy, it is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA. An aneurysm is considered 'complex' when the bulge is very close to the important blood vessels that go to your kidneys and other organs. This location makes it more difficult to repair.\n\nIf an aneurysm grows too large, it can burst. A burst aneurysm is a life-threatening emergency.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which treatment is best for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. We compared three different approaches:\n– Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR): This is a less invasive procedure where a special tube, called a stent graft, is placed inside the aorta to strengthen it. The graft has small, custom-made holes (fenestrations) to allow blood to keep flowing to the kidneys and other organs.\n– Open surgical repair: This involves a large cut in the tummy to replace the bulging part of the aorta with a man-made tube.\n– Conservative management: This means not having surgery and instead monitoring the aneurysm with regular scans to see if it grows.\n\nWe wanted to know how these treatments affected:\n– how many people died within one year of treatment\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n– problems with kidney function\n– whether people needed another operation\n– people's quality of life\n– any unwanted effects of treatment\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are randomly put into different treatment groups. This is the best way to compare treatments fairly.\n\nWe looked for studies that compared FEVAR with either open surgical repair or conservative management in adults with complex AAAs. We planned to compare and summarize the results of the studies and rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe did not find any studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause we found no suitable studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of FEVAR compared to open surgery or no surgery for complex AAAs.\n\nThis means we do not have high-quality evidence to help patients and doctors decide on the best treatment. It is difficult to do this kind of research because complex AAAs are not very common, and each person's aneurysm can be very different. This makes it hard to group people together for studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
