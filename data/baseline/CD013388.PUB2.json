    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nCan cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday tasks?\n\nKey Messages\n– Cognitive rehabilitation is a type of therapy that helps people with mild to moderate dementia find new ways to manage everyday tasks they find difficult.\n– We are very confident that people who receive cognitive rehabilitation get much better at achieving their personal goals, for example, using a phone or cooking a meal. These benefits last for at least 3 to 12 months after the therapy ends.\n– Cognitive rehabilitation may also slightly improve a person's confidence. For caregivers, it may slightly improve some aspects of their quality of life.\n\nWhat is dementia?\nDementia is a condition that affects the brain. It can cause problems with memory, thinking, and the ability to do everyday things. These problems tend to get worse over time. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. People with dementia often need support from family members or friends, who are sometimes called caregivers.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if a therapy called cognitive rehabilitation could help people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWe were especially interested in whether it helped people to:\n– manage everyday activities they wanted to improve\n– improve their memory and thinking skills\n– feel more confident and independent\n– improve their mood and quality of life\n\nWe also wanted to know if cognitive rehabilitation had any effects on the caregivers of people with dementia.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care or no therapy. The people in the studies all had mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that included 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nOur main finding is that cognitive rehabilitation helps people achieve the personal goals they set for themselves. For example, if a person's goal was to learn how to use a new coffee machine, the therapy helped them do that. Both the people with dementia and their caregivers reported that they were much better at doing their chosen tasks after the therapy. This improvement lasted for at least 3 to 12 months after the therapy finished.\n\nWe also found that cognitive rehabilitation may slightly improve a person's confidence and their ability to remember things immediately after being told them.\n\nFor caregivers, the therapy may have small benefits for their quality of life, such as feeling more connected to others. The effects on other things, like general daily functioning, mood, or other types of memory, were less clear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are very confident in our main finding that cognitive rehabilitation helps people achieve their specific goals.\n\nHowever, most of this evidence comes from one large, well-designed study. Our confidence would be even stronger if more high-quality studies showed the same large benefits.\n\nIn studies like these, it is not possible for people to be unaware of which treatment they are getting. This means that people with dementia and the therapists knew they were getting the therapy, which can sometimes influence the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
