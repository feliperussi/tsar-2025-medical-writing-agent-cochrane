    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nUsing a surgical drain after an operation for a burst appendix: does it help or harm?\n\nKey Messages\n– We are very unsure if using a surgical drain after an operation for a burst appendix helps to prevent a pocket of pus (an abscess) from forming inside the belly. A surgical drain is a soft tube placed into the body to remove fluid after an operation.\n\n– Using a drain after an operation for a burst appendix probably increases the risk of dying.\n\n– People who have a drain may also stay in the hospital longer, but we are very unsure about this.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nThe appendix is a small tube connected to the large intestine. Appendicitis happens when the appendix becomes swollen and infected. It is a medical emergency that usually requires an operation to remove the appendix, called an appendectomy.\n\nSometimes, appendicitis becomes 'complicated'. This means the appendix has burst or started to decay. Complicated appendicitis is more serious and can lead to problems after surgery, such as infections inside the belly.\n\nAfter an operation for complicated appendicitis, some surgeons place a soft tube, called a drain, into the belly. The drain is meant to remove any infected fluid and prevent a pocket of pus, called an abscess, from forming. However, doctors are not sure if using a drain is helpful or harmful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a surgical drain after an operation for complicated appendicitis is better than not using one.\n\nWe were interested in how using a drain affects:\n– pockets of pus inside the belly (abscesses)\n– wound infections\n– other health problems after surgery\n– death\n– how long people stayed in the hospital\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at using a surgical drain compared with not using a drain in people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis. The people in the studies could be children or adults.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included 739 people who had an operation for complicated appendicitis. In these studies, 370 people had a drain placed and 369 did not.\n\nPockets of pus (abscesses) and other health problems\nWe are very unsure if using a drain makes any difference to the number of people who get an abscess or a wound infection after their operation. We are also very unsure if it affects the risk of having other health problems.\n\nDeath\nUsing a drain probably increases the risk of dying within 30 days of the operation. In the studies, 7 out of 291 people who had a drain died, compared with 1 out of 290 people who did not have a drain.\n\nLength of hospital stay\nPeople who had a drain may have stayed in the hospital about 1.5 days longer than those without a drain. However, we are very unsure about this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in most of our findings. This is because there were problems with how some of the studies were done. Also, the studies were small and their results were not always consistent.\n\nThe finding that drains may increase the risk of death is serious. However, it is based on a very small number of deaths in total. We need larger and better studies to be more certain about the benefits and harms of using drains after this type of surgery.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023."
