    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nHow well do decision aids work for people making choices about their health?\n\nKey Messages\n– Patient decision aids are tools, such as booklets or websites, that help people make health choices. They give information on the different options, including their benefits and harms. They also help you think about what matters most to you.\n– Compared to people who received usual care, people who used decision aids understood their health options better. They were also more likely to make a choice that matched their personal values.\n– Decision aids also helped people feel more informed, less conflicted about their choice, and more involved in making the decision with their doctor.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPeople often face difficult decisions about their health. You might need to decide whether to have a screening test, start a new medicine, or have surgery. To make the best choice for you, you need to understand your options.\n\nPatient decision aids are tools designed to help with this process. They can be booklets, videos, or websites. They explain the health problem and the different choices you have. They use the best available evidence to describe the possible benefits and harms of each option.\n\nDecision aids often include exercises to help you think about what is most important to you. They do not tell you what to do. Instead, they support you and your doctor in making a decision together that feels right for you.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if using a patient decision aid helps people make better health decisions compared to getting usual care. Usual care could be a standard chat with a doctor or a general information leaflet.\n\nWe were interested in several things, including:\n– whether people made choices that matched what was important to them\n– how much people knew about their options\n– how well people understood the possible benefits and harms\n- whether people felt confident and less conflicted about their choice\n– if people took an active part in the decision\n– any unwanted effects, like regretting the decision later\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at patient decision aids compared with usual care for adults facing a health decision. The people in the studies were put into groups by chance to receive either a decision aid or usual care.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 209 studies that included 107,698 people. The studies covered 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about cancer screening, treatments for heart conditions, cancer treatments, and joint replacement surgery.\n\nCompared to usual care, we found that decision aids:\n– probably helped more people make a choice that was in line with their personal values.\n– greatly improved people's knowledge about their condition and treatment options.\n– helped people have a more accurate understanding of the possible benefits and harms.\n– helped people feel more informed and less uncertain about their decision.\n– encouraged people to take a more active role in making the decision with their doctor.\n\nUsing a decision aid did not seem to affect whether people regretted their choice later on. Using a decision aid before a doctor's appointment did not make the appointment longer. Using one during the appointment made it slightly longer, by about 1 or 2 minutes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident in most of our findings. However, some studies did not give enough detail about how they were carried out. For example, it was not always clear if people in the studies knew which group they were in, which might have influenced their answers. These problems with how some studies were done mean we have less confidence in some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
