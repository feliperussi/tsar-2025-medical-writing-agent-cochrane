    "output": "Which ways of using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) work best for quitting smoking?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Using two types of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) together is more likely to help people quit smoking than using just one type. NRT gives you nicotine in forms like patches, gum, or lozenges to help reduce cravings when you stop smoking. Using a patch for a steady dose of nicotine plus a fast-acting form like gum for sudden cravings works best.\n\n– Higher doses of NRT seem to work better than lower doses. For example, using a higher-strength patch or 4 mg nicotine gum (instead of 2 mg gum) may increase the chances of quitting successfully.\n\n– Starting to use NRT before your quit day may also help you quit, but we are less certain about this finding.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)?\n\nWhen people stop smoking, their bodies miss the nicotine they used to get from cigarettes. This can cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms and strong cravings, which makes quitting difficult.\n\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medicine that gives you a small, controlled amount of nicotine. It does not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, or other harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. NRT helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, making it easier for people to stop smoking for good. NRT comes in different forms, such as:\n\n– skin patches\n– chewing gum\n– lozenges\n– nasal sprays\n– inhalers\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe already know that using NRT helps people quit smoking. In this review, we wanted to find out if some ways of using NRT are better than others. We were interested in:\n\n– using two types of NRT versus one type\n– using higher-dose NRT versus lower-dose NRT\n– using NRT for a longer time versus a shorter time\n– starting NRT before quit day versus on quit day\n– any unwanted effects of the different treatments\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of using NRT in people who wanted to quit smoking. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 68 studies that included 43,327 people who wanted to quit smoking.\n\nUsing two forms of NRT is better than one\nPeople who used a nicotine patch plus a fast-acting NRT (like gum or a lozenge) were more likely to quit smoking for 6 months or longer than people who used only one type of NRT. We are very confident in this result.\n\nHigher doses may be better than lower doses\nHigher-strength nicotine patches seemed to help people quit more than lower-strength patches. For example, 21 mg patches worked better than 14 mg patches. We are moderately confident in this finding.\n\nStarting NRT before your quit day may help\nStarting to use NRT a few weeks before the day you plan to quit may increase your chances of quitting successfully compared to starting on your quit day.\n\nOther comparisons\nUsing a fast-acting NRT alone (like gum or a lozenge) seemed to work about as well as using a nicotine patch alone. We did not find clear evidence that using NRT for a longer time helps more than using it for a shorter time.\n\nUnwanted effects\nThe studies did not report much information about unwanted effects. Overall, serious unwanted effects were rare. Some people using the highest-dose patches or the nasal spray were more likely to stop the treatment because of side effects compared to people using lower-dose patches.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results varies. For some questions, like whether using two forms of NRT is better than one, we are very confident in the evidence.\n\nFor other questions, our confidence is lower. This was sometimes because there were not enough studies or people included. In other cases, there were problems with how the studies were done, which could make the results less reliable. Also, most studies did not collect or report information on unwanted effects very well, so we know very little about the safety of different ways of using NRT.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022."
