    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nTreatments for kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease\n\nKey Messages\n- We are not sure if common treatments help prevent or reduce long-term kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. The evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain.\n- In young children with sickle cell disease, a medicine called hydroxyurea may help their kidneys concentrate urine. However, we are not sure if it improves how well the kidneys filter blood or if it changes the number of serious health problems they have.\n- We need more and better studies to understand how to best protect the kidneys of people with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and how does it affect the kidneys?\nSickle cell disease is a serious health condition that people are born with. It affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. In people with sickle cell disease, some red blood cells are shaped like a crescent or \"sickle.\" These cells can get stuck in small blood vessels and block blood flow.\n\nThis can cause severe pain and damage to organs over time, including the kidneys. When the kidneys are damaged and do not work well for a long time, it is called chronic kidney disease.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatments can help prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nWe were interested in treatments like:\n- a medicine called hydroxyurea\n- medicines called ACE inhibitors, which are often used for blood pressure and kidney problems\n- red blood cell transfusions\n\nWe looked at how these treatments affected:\n- how well the kidneys filter blood\n- the amount of protein in the urine (a sign of kidney damage)\n- any serious unwanted effects, like severe pain or chest problems\n- quality of life\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments with a dummy treatment (a placebo) or another treatment in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that included a total of 385 people with sickle cell disease.\n\nHydroxyurea compared to a dummy treatment\nOne study looked at 193 young children (aged 9 to 18 months). The study found that:\n- hydroxyurea may help the children's kidneys to concentrate urine better.\n- we are not sure if hydroxyurea improves how well the kidneys filter blood.\n- hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to the number of serious problems children had, such as severe pain, chest infections, or stays in the hospital.\n\nACE inhibitors compared to a dummy treatment\nOne small study looked at 22 adults. We are not sure if the ACE inhibitor helped reduce the amount of protein in their urine or protected their kidneys in other ways. The study was too small to be certain.\n\nACE inhibitors compared to vitamin C\nOne study looked at 170 children. We could not use the information from this study to tell if the ACE inhibitor worked better than vitamin C to reduce protein in the urine.\n\nWe did not find any studies that looked at red blood cell transfusions for preventing kidney problems. None of the studies reported on people's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because there were only a few small studies. There were also some problems with how the studies were done.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the results. The results could change when more research is done.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2021."
