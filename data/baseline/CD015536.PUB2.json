    "output": "Plain Language Summary: Entecavir for people with long-term hepatitis B\n\nWhat are the benefits and harms of the medicine entecavir for people with long-term hepatitis B?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We wanted to find out if the medicine entecavir is better than no treatment or a placebo (a dummy pill) for children and adults with long-term (chronic) hepatitis B, a liver infection.\n\n– We are very uncertain about the effects of entecavir. The available studies do not provide enough reliable information to know if entecavir affects the risk of death or serious unwanted effects.\n\n– None of the studies we found looked at how entecavir affects people's quality of life.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B?\n\nHepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. When the infection lasts for more than six months, it is called \"chronic\".\n\nChronic hepatitis B is a serious condition because it can lead to long-term liver damage, such as scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and liver cancer. Many people with chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms for a long time, but some may feel tired, have a fever, or develop yellow skin and eyes (jaundice).\n\nHow is chronic hepatitis B treated?\n\nDoctors may prescribe antiviral medicines to treat chronic hepatitis B. These medicines work by stopping the virus from multiplying in the body. This can help reduce liver damage. Entecavir is one of the antiviral medicines recommended for treating chronic hepatitis B.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if entecavir is better than no treatment or a placebo for people with chronic hepatitis B.\n\nWe were particularly interested in the effects of entecavir on:\n– death from any cause\n– people's quality of life\n– serious unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared entecavir with either no treatment or a placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 22 studies that included 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies lasted from 5 weeks to about 4 years.\n\nWe found that:\n– No one died in either the entecavir groups or the no treatment/placebo groups in the studies that reported this information. Because there were no deaths, we cannot tell if entecavir has any effect on the risk of dying.\n\n– None of the studies reported on people's quality of life, so we do not know if entecavir affects it.\n\n– We are very uncertain if entecavir makes a difference to the risk of having serious unwanted effects. The results were not clear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because there were problems with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. Also, very few people in the studies experienced serious health problems, which makes it difficult to be sure about the results. Because of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of entecavir.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
