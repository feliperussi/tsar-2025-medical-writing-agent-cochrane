    "output": "Does the medicine dexmedetomidine help newborn babies on breathing machines with pain and sleepiness?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We wanted to find out if a medicine called dexmedetomidine is safe and helpful for pain relief and sedation (making a baby sleepy and calm) in newborn babies who need a breathing machine.\n\n– We did not find any completed studies that answered our question.\n\n– Because there are no studies, we do not know if dexmedetomidine is better, worse, or the same as other medicines for these babies. We also do not know about its safety or long-term effects.\n\nWhy do newborn babies need help with breathing and pain?\n\nSome newborn babies, especially those who are born very early or are very sick, may have trouble breathing on their own. They may need a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe. This is also called mechanical ventilation.\n\nBeing on a ventilator can be uncomfortable or painful for a baby. To help them stay calm and comfortable, doctors give them medicines. Medicines for pain relief are called analgesics, and medicines to help them rest and stay sleepy are called sedatives.\n\nMedicines like morphine are often used, but they can have unwanted side effects. Doctors are looking for other options that might work as well but be safer for babies. Dexmedetomidine is one of these medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is a safe and effective medicine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on a breathing machine.\n\nWe wanted to know if dexmedetomidine was better or worse than:\n– other medicines used for sedation or pain relief\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment with no medicine in it)\n\nWe were interested in several things, including:\n– how much pain relief the baby got\n– how calm and sleepy the baby was\n– how long the baby needed the breathing machine\n– if the baby needed extra medicine for pain or sedation\n– any unwanted effects, like low blood pressure\n– the baby's brain development later in life\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at dexmedetomidine compared with other medicines or a placebo in newborn babies on a breathing machine. We planned to compare and summarize the results of the studies and rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe did not find any completed studies to include in our review.\n\nWe found 4 studies that are still in progress. When these studies are finished, they may give us some information about how well dexmedetomidine works and if it is safe for newborn babies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nBecause we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about using dexmedetomidine for newborn babies on breathing machines.\n\nThere is not enough information to know about the benefits or harms of this medicine for these babies. We also have no information about its long-term effects on a baby's development. More research is needed to answer these questions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
