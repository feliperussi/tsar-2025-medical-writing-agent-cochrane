    "output": "When is the best time to remove a urinary catheter after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages\n\n– After a kidney transplant, a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed in the bladder to help it drain urine and heal.\n\n– We wanted to know if removing this catheter early (before 5 days) or late (at 5 days or later) is better for preventing problems like urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are infections in the bladder or kidneys.\n\n– We are very uncertain if the timing of catheter removal makes any difference. This is because there were only two small studies, and they were not done very well. More and better research is needed.\n\nWhat happens after a kidney transplant?\n\nWhen a person's kidneys stop working properly, this is called end-stage kidney disease. The best treatment is often a kidney transplant, which is an operation to give someone a healthy kidney from another person.\n\nDuring the surgery, doctors place a thin, flexible tube called a urinary catheter into the bladder. This tube drains urine out of the body and into a collection bag. This allows the new connection between the kidney and the bladder to heal without pressure.\n\nHowever, having a catheter can increase the risk of getting a UTI because it can let bacteria enter the bladder. The longer the catheter stays in, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on the best time to remove the catheter after a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if removing a urinary catheter early (before 5 days) is better or worse than removing it late (at 5 days or later) for people who have had a kidney transplant.\n\nWe were interested in how the timing of removal affected:\n\n– UTIs that cause symptoms (like pain when peeing or a fever)\n– bacteria in the urine that does not cause symptoms\n– serious urinary problems that need more treatment\n– any other unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at removing a urinary catheter early compared with removing it late in people who had a kidney transplant.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 197 people. The studies followed people for up to one month after their surgery.\n\nThe evidence we found is very uncertain. This means we do not know if removing the catheter early or late makes any difference to the chance of getting bacteria in the urine.\n\nThe studies did not provide enough information for us to know about other important things, like the number of UTIs with symptoms or other serious problems with the urinary system.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is for a few reasons:\n\n– There were only two small studies.\n– There were problems with how the studies were done, which could make the results unreliable.\n– One of the studies was only published as a short summary, so it did not give us much information.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
