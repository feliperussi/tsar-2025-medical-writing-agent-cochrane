    "output": "Can talking therapies, education, or relaxation help people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?\n\nKey Messages\n\n– For adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is a long-term condition that causes swelling in the gut, psychological support may slightly improve quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety. This support can include talking therapies, patient education programs, or relaxation techniques.\n\n– For children and teenagers with IBD, talking therapies may improve their quality of life. We are less sure about other benefits for this age group because there was not enough information.\n\n– These psychological approaches probably have little to no effect on how active the IBD is. In other words, they do not seem to reduce the swelling in the gut itself.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term (or chronic) condition that causes parts of the gut to become swollen, inflamed, and sore. The two main types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\nSymptoms can come and go and often include belly pain, diarrhea (which may have blood in it), weight loss, and feeling very tired. Living with IBD can be difficult and stressful. Because of this, people with IBD have a higher chance of experiencing mental health problems like anxiety and depression.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychological support can help people with IBD manage their condition and improve their well-being. We looked at three main types of support:\n– talking therapies (psychotherapy)\n– patient education programs\n– relaxation techniques\n\nWe were interested in how these treatments affected:\n– quality of life\n– feelings of depression\n– feelings of anxiety\n– how active the IBD was\n– any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological support with usual medical care for people with IBD. The studies included adults, children, and teenagers.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 48 studies that included 6405 people with IBD.\n\nFor adults with IBD:\nWe found that talking therapies, patient education, and relaxation techniques all seemed to lead to small improvements in quality of life. They also seemed to slightly reduce feelings of depression and anxiety compared to usual care. However, these types of support did not seem to change how active the IBD was.\n\nFor children and teenagers with IBD:\nWe found that talking therapies probably improve quality of life. There was not enough information from the studies to know if these therapies helped with anxiety or depression, or if other types of support like education or relaxation were helpful for this age group.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons.\n\nThere were some problems with how the studies were done. For example, in many studies, people knew whether they were getting the psychological support or not. This knowledge might have affected how they answered questions about their well-being.\n\nAlso, the studies used many different types of therapies and often included only a small number of people. This makes the results less certain and harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
