    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes controlling blood pressure help prevent or slow down eye problems from diabetes?\n\nKey Messages\n- For people with diabetes, tighter control of blood pressure probably helps prevent a specific eye problem called diabetic retinopathy from starting. The benefit seems to be greatest for people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure.\n\n- We are less certain if tighter blood pressure control helps to slow down diabetic retinopathy once it has already started. The evidence did not show that it prevented serious vision loss.\n\n- Tighter blood pressure control may increase the risk of having blood pressure that is too low (hypotension), which can cause dizziness or fainting.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy?\nDiabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can affect people who have diabetes. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage the small blood vessels in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.\n\nThis damage can cause blurry vision and, if not treated, can lead to blindness. Controlling blood sugar is known to be very important for preventing this problem.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure also helps people with diabetes avoid or manage diabetic retinopathy.\n\nWe looked at whether controlling blood pressure:\n- stops diabetic retinopathy from starting\n- slows down diabetic retinopathy after it has started\n- prevents serious vision loss or other advanced eye problems\n- causes any unwanted effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different levels of blood pressure control in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some studies compared tighter blood pressure control with usual care. Other studies compared blood pressure medicines with a dummy pill (placebo).\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that included a total of 27,185 people with diabetes. The studies took place all over the world and lasted from less than one year to nine years.\n\nOur main findings were:\n- People who had tighter blood pressure control were probably less likely to develop diabetic retinopathy over five years. This effect was clearest in people with type 2 diabetes who also had high blood pressure.\n\n- The evidence was not clear about whether tighter blood pressure control helped to slow down diabetic retinopathy in people who already had it. It also did not seem to prevent serious vision loss.\n\n- People who received tighter blood pressure control were more likely to have episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension). There was no clear difference in the number of deaths between the groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. For some outcomes, like slowing down the eye problem, the results from different studies were not consistent. This makes it harder to be sure about the overall effect.\n\nAlso, the studies used different medicines and had different blood pressure goals. This makes it difficult to combine their results to get a clear answer. For some questions, there were not enough studies to give us a confident answer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021."
