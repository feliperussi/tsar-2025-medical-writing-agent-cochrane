    "output": "Treatments for clotted access points for people on kidney dialysis\n\nKey messages\n\n– People on haemodialysis (a treatment to clean the blood for people whose kidneys have stopped working) need a special access point in their arm, called a fistula or a graft, to connect to the dialysis machine. Sometimes these access points get blocked by a blood clot.\n\n– We looked at studies of different treatments to unblock clotted access points, including surgery to remove the clot, special devices to remove the clot, and medicines to dissolve the clot.\n\n– We do not know which treatment is best. The available studies were too small and had problems in how they were done, so we have very little confidence in their results. More and better research is needed.\n\nWhat is a clotted dialysis access point?\n\nWhen a person's kidneys fail, they may need a treatment called haemodialysis to clean their blood. A machine does the work of the kidneys. To connect to the machine, a doctor creates a special access point under the skin, usually in the arm. This is done by joining an artery and a vein.\n\nThere are two main types of access points:\n– An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) uses the person's own blood vessels.\n– An arteriovenous graft (AVG) uses a soft, man-made tube to connect the artery and vein.\n\nA serious problem can happen when a blood clot forms inside the fistula or graft. This blockage stops blood from flowing, so the person cannot have their dialysis treatment. When this happens, they need urgent treatment to remove the clot and unblock the access point.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which treatment works best to unblock clotted fistulas and grafts in people on haemodialysis.\n\nWe were interested in how different treatments affected:\n– how long the access point stayed open and working after treatment\n– whether the treatment failed to unblock the access point\n– any unwanted or harmful effects from the treatments\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for clotted dialysis access points. The treatments included different types of surgery, devices, and medicines to get rid of the clot.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1176 people on haemodialysis.\n\nThe studies looked at three main types of treatment:\n– Thrombectomy: removing the clot, either with surgery or with a special mechanical device.\n– Thrombolysis: using medicines to dissolve the clot.\n– Other surgical procedures to fix the access point.\n\nOverall, the evidence was not strong enough to show if any one treatment was better than another for unblocking the access point and keeping it working. There was a small suggestion that surgery to remove a clot might work better than using a mechanical device, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nThe studies did not report much information on other important results, such as how the treatments affected people's ability to have successful dialysis.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence we found.\n\nThis is because most of the studies had problems with how they were designed and carried out. Many studies also included only a small number of people. Because of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the results. Future research is very likely to change the conclusions of this review.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024."
