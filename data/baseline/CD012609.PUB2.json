    "output": "Infliximab to keep Crohn's disease symptoms from coming back\n\nKey messages\n\n– For people with Crohn's disease whose symptoms are under control, taking the medicine infliximab probably helps keep symptoms away for longer compared to taking a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n\n– For people already taking medicines called purine analogues, adding infliximab probably works better to keep symptoms away than taking purine analogues alone.\n\n– We are very uncertain about the risk of unwanted or serious side effects for these treatments because the studies were not clear enough.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\n\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition where parts of the gut become sore and swollen (inflamed). This can cause symptoms like stomach pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and feeling very tired.\n\nWhen symptoms are active, it is called a 'flare-up'. When symptoms are gone or much better, it is called 'remission'. The goal of treatment is to get symptoms into remission and then keep them there to prevent flare-ups.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if the medicine infliximab is good at keeping Crohn's disease in remission. Infliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic' that works by blocking a substance in the body that causes swelling.\n\nWe were interested in how infliximab compared with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment)\n– other medicines for Crohn's disease\n– a 'biosimilar' medicine (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab)\n\nWe also wanted to know if infliximab caused any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with other treatments or a placebo for people with Crohn's disease.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 9 studies that included 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies lasted between 6 months and 2 years.\n\nInfliximab compared with a placebo\nPeople taking infliximab were probably less likely to have their symptoms come back (a relapse) than people taking a placebo. We are very uncertain about whether infliximab causes more or fewer side effects than a placebo.\n\nInfliximab combined with purine analogues (another type of medicine)\nAdding infliximab to purine analogues probably works better to prevent symptoms from coming back than taking purine analogues alone. We are very uncertain about the risk of side effects for this combination compared to purine analogues alone.\n\nInfliximab compared with a biosimilar medicine\nThere may be little or no difference between infliximab and a biosimilar medicine in preventing symptoms from coming back. However, infliximab may stop working as well over time for more people than the biosimilar does. We are not very confident in these results.\n\nOther comparisons\nWe did not find enough clear evidence to know if infliximab works better or worse than other biologic medicines, such as adalimumab. We also could not tell if giving a biosimilar medicine as an injection under the skin works differently from giving it through a drip into a vein.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the results is limited. For many of our questions, especially about side effects, we are very uncertain about the results. This is because some studies were small or had problems with how they were done. This means that future research could change our findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
