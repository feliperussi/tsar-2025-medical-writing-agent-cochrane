    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of combined oral contraceptive pills for managing primary dysmenorrhoea?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* OCPs reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than placebo.\n* OCPs probably increase the risk of any adverse events and may also increase the risk of serious adverse events.\n* Women who received OCPs had an increased risk of irregular bleeding compared to women who received placebo or no treatment.\n* OCPs probably increase the risk of headaches and nausea.\n* Continuous use of OCPs may reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than the standard regimen.\n* There is probably little or no difference between third- and fourth-generation and first- and second-generation OCPs.\n* Due to lack of data, we are uncertain if NSAIDs are better than OCPs for treating dysmenorrhoea.\n* Long-term effects were not covered in this review.\n* Continuous use of OCPs was probably more effective than the standard regimen but safety should be ensured with long-term data.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\nThis review evaluated the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\n**Background:**\n\nDysmenorrhoea (painful menstrual cramps) is common and a major cause of pain in women. Combined oral contraceptives (OCPs) are often used in the management of primary dysmenorrhoea, but there is a need for reporting the benefits and harms. Primary dysmenorrhoea is defined as painful menstrual cramps without pelvic pathology.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared combined OCPs with placebo or other treatments. We summarized and combined the results of the included studies. We evaluated the quality of the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe included 21 RCTs (3723 women). Eleven RCTs compared combined OCP with placebo, eight compared different dosages of combined OCP, one compared two OCP regimens with placebo, and one compared OCP with NSAIDs.\n\nOCPs reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than placebo. Six studies reported treatment effects on different scales; the result can be interpreted as a moderate reduction in pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.74 to −0.41; I² = 28%; 6 RCTs, 588 women; high-quality evidence). Six studies also reported pain improvement as a dichotomous outcome (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.10; I² = 69%; 6 RCTs, 717 women; low-quality evidence).\n\nOCPs probably increase the risk of any adverse events (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.43; I² = 79%; 7 RCTs, 1025 women; moderate-quality evidence), and may also increase the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.49 to 6.43; I² = 22%; 4 RCTs, 512 women; low-quality evidence).\n\nWomen who received OCPs had an increased risk of irregular bleeding compared to women who received placebo or no treatment (RR 2.63, 95% CI 2.11 to 3.28; I² = 29%; 7 RCTs, 1025 women; high-quality evidence). In women with a risk of irregular bleeding of 18% if using placebo or no treatment, the risk would be between 39% and 60% if using combined OCP.\n\nOCPs probably increase the risk of headaches (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.04; I² = 44%; 5 RCTs, 656 women; moderate-quality evidence), and nausea (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.30; I² = 39%; 8 RCTs, 948 women; moderate-quality evidence).\n\nWe are uncertain of the effect of OCP on weight gain (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.45; 1 RCT, 76 women; low-quality evidence). OCPs may slightly reduce requirements for additional medication (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 163 women; low-quality evidence), and absence from work (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 148 women; low-quality evidence).\n\nOne OCP versus another OCP\n\nContinuous use of OCPs (no pause or inactive tablets after the usual 21 days of hormone pills) may reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than the standard regimen (SMD −0.73, 95% CI −1.13 to 0.34; 2 RCTs, 106 women; low-quality evidence).\n\nThere was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in pain improvement between ethinylestradiol 20 μg and ethinylestradiol 30 μg OCPs (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.74; 1 RCT, 326 women; moderate-quality evidence).\n\nThere is probably little or no difference between third- and fourth-generation and first- and second-generation OCPs (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 178 women; moderate-quality evidence).\n\nOCPs may slightly increase the risk of any adverse events over the continuous regimen (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22; I² = 76%; 3 RCTs, 602 women; low-quality evidence), and probably increases the risk of irregular bleeding (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.69; 2 RCTs, 379 women; moderate-quality evidence).\n\nDue to lack of studies, it is uncertain if there is a difference between continuous and standard regimen OCPs in serious adverse events (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.24; 1 RCT, 212 women), headaches (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.76; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 435 women), or nausea (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.30; I² = 23%; 2 RCTs, 435 women) (all very low-quality evidence).\n\nOCPs versus NSAIDs\n\nThere were insufficient data to determine whether OCPs were more effective than NSAIDs for pain (mean difference −0.30, 95% CI −5.43 to 4.83; 1 RCT, 91 women; low-quality evidence). The study did not report on adverse events.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021."
