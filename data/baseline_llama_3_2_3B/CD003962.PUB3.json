    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of non-immunosuppressive treatment for IgA nephropathy?**\n\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure. Non-immunosuppressive treatment is used to manage IgAN by improving blood pressure, decreasing protein in the urine, and avoiding long-term immunosuppressive treatment.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgAN. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of non-immunosuppressive agents in adults and children with biopsy-proven IgAN.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 80 studies that involved 4856 people with IgAN. The biggest study was in 369 people. We found that:\n\n* RAS inhibition probably decreases proteinuria but may result in little or no difference to kidney failure or doubling of serum creatinine or complete remission of proteinuria.\n* Tonsillectomy in people with IgAN in addition to standard care may increase remission of proteinuria and remission of microscopic haematuria but may decrease relapse of proteinuria and relapse of haematuria.\n* Anticoagulant therapy, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines exhibited small benefits to kidney function in patients with IgAN when compared to placebo or no treatment.\n* Antimalarial therapy compared to placebo reported an increase in a > 50% reduction of proteinuria.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe risk of bias within the included studies was mostly high or unclear. The certainty of the evidence of RCTs demonstrating a benefit of tonsillectomy to patients with Japanese patients with IgAN was low. The RCT evidence is insufficiently robust to demonstrate efficacy for the other non-immunosuppressive treatments evaluated here.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2023.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nFuture research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in people with IgAN."
