    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n**Is surgery better than other treatments for fixing a blocked dialysis tube?**\n\nPeople who need dialysis have a tube in their arm that helps clean their blood. Sometimes, this tube gets blocked, and they need to have it fixed. There are different ways to fix a blocked dialysis tube, and we wanted to know which one is best.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe looked at 14 studies that included 1,176 people who had a blocked dialysis tube. We found that there were different ways to fix the tube, including surgery, a procedure to dissolve the blockage, and a procedure to remove the blockage. Most of the studies had some problems, such as not being well-designed or not having enough participants.\n\n**What did we conclude?**\n\nWe couldn't find enough good evidence to say that one way to fix a blocked dialysis tube is better than another. However, we did find that surgery might be better than other treatments for fixing the tube at 30 days. But we're not sure, and we need more research to figure out what's best.\n\n**What does this mean for people with a blocked dialysis tube?**\n\nRight now, it's not clear what the best way to fix a blocked dialysis tube is. But we know that it's an important problem, and we need to keep looking for better solutions. We hope that future research will help us find the best way to fix a blocked dialysis tube and keep people with dialysis healthy.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nWe need more research to figure out what's best for people with a blocked dialysis tube. We should look at different ways to fix the tube and see which one is safest and most effective. We should also talk to people with dialysis and their families to see what they think is best."
