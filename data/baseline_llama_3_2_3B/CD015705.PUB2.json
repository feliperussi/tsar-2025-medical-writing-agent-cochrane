    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of healthcare workers using their personal mobile phones to support their work?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones to support their work, but this can have both benefits and drawbacks.\n* The benefits include being more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients' needs, and strengthening healthcare workers' relationships with community members and colleagues.\n* However, the risks include the potential for social hierarchies and inequities among healthcare workers, and the possibility of confidentiality breaches or unequal access to information.\n* Efforts to strengthen formal health systems should consider how to retain the benefits of informal solutions and reduce their negative effects.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n* What is healthcare workers' informal use of mobile phones and other mobile devices to support their work?\n* Why is this topic important?\n* What did we want to find out?\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that explored healthcare workers' views, experiences and practices regarding mobile phones and other mobile devices, and that included data about healthcare workers' informal use of these devices for work purposes.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found that healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones to support their work, but this can have both benefits and drawbacks. The benefits include being more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients' needs, and strengthening healthcare workers' relationships with community members and colleagues. However, the risks include the potential for social hierarchies and inequities among healthcare workers, and the possibility of confidentiality breaches or unequal access to information.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have moderate to high confidence in the statements in the following line of argument. The healthcare workers in this review, like other “street-level bureaucrats’, face a gap between what is expected of them and the resources available to them. To plug this gap, healthcare workers develop their own strategies, including using their own mobile phones, data and airtime. They also use other personal resources, including their personal time when taking and making calls outside working hours, and their personal networks when contacting others for help and advice.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review is based on studies published between 2013 and 2022. The evidence is up to date to August 2022. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.\n\nPlease note that this is a machine-generated summary and may not be perfect. It's always best to have a human review and edit the summary to ensure accuracy and clarity."
