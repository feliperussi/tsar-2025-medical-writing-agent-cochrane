    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**Is surgery for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis effective?**\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of surgery for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis?**\n\nSurgery for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis may improve nasal symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain. There is no clear evidence that surgery reduces bacterial colonization or pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nMore research is needed to determine the effectiveness of surgery for this condition. Future studies should aim to increase the number of participants and evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis and pulmonary function. The benefits and risks of surgery for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis are unclear and need further investigation.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe current review suggests that surgery may not be effective in reducing pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The evidence is very low certainty, and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of surgery for this condition.\n\nPlease note that this is a manual transformation and may not be perfect. If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask."
