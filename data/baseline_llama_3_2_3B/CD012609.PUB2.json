    "output": "Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nHere is the transformed Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following Cochrane guidelines:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of infliximab for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   **Infliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than placebo (moderate-certainty evidence).**\n*   **Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone (moderate-certainty evidence).**\n*   **We cannot draw meaningful conclusions about other comparisons and outcomes related to missing data or very low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision and risk of bias.**\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   **What is Crohn's disease?**\n    Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation and damage to the digestive tract.\n*   **Why is maintaining remission important?**\n    Maintaining remission is crucial for managing Crohn's disease, as it reduces the risk of complications and improves quality of life.\n*   **What is the purpose of this review?**\n    The purpose of this review is to determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n*   We searched for studies that compared infliximab to placebo or another active comparator for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease.\n*   We included 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria.\n*   We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   Infliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than placebo (moderate-certainty evidence).\n*   Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone (moderate-certainty evidence).\n*   We cannot draw meaningful conclusions about other comparisons and outcomes related to missing data or very low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision and risk of bias.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is up to date to August 2021.\n\n**Authors' conclusions:**\n\n*   Infliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than placebo (moderate-certainty evidence).\n*   Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone (moderate-certainty evidence).\n*   We cannot draw meaningful conclusions about other comparisons and outcomes related to missing data or very low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision and risk of bias."
