    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure?**\n\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a new onset or worsening of chronic heart failure characterized by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalization.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out: which types of intravenous loop diuretics strategies work best to help people with acute heart failure.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 7 studies that involved 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies were done in 32 hospitals in 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from 8 months to 6 years.\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics?**\n\nContinuous infusion may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.\n\nPlease note that this is a manual transformation and may not be perfect. If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask."
