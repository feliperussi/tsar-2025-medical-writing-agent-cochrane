    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Maintenance therapy for CLL may improve progression-free survival, but also increases the risk of adverse events.\n* There is currently moderate to very low-certainty evidence available regarding the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy in people with CLL.\n* Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) maintenance may improve progression-free survival, but also increases the risk of adverse events.\n* Immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) maintenance may improve progression-free survival, but also increases the risk of adverse events.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language or publication status restrictions to assess the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for CLL.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe identified 11 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, including seven trials comparing anti-CD20 mAbs (rituximab or ofatumumab) with observation in 1679 participants, and three trials comparing IMiD (lenalidomide) with placebo/observation in 693 participants.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is moderate to very low-certainty, and there is a risk of bias in the included studies. The effects of alemtuzumab maintenance are uncertain, coupled with a warning for drug-related infectious toxicity.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nFuture research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the effects of novel maintenance interventions, such as B-cell receptor inhibitors, B-cell leukaemia-2/lymphoma-2 inhibitors, or obinutuzumab."
