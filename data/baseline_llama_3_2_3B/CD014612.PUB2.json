    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of closing mesenteric defects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   Closing mesenteric defects may reduce the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction within 10 years after surgery.\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative overall complications, the incidence of postoperative mortality, and the incidence of intraoperative overall complications.\n*   The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure than for those who did not have the defects closed. However, the evidence is very uncertain about this outcome.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   **What is internal hernia?** Internal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. It happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weak spot in the abdominal wall.\n*   **Why is closing mesenteric defects important?** Closing mesenteric defects may help prevent internal hernia and reduce the risk of complications. However, the evidence is not yet strong enough to make a definitive recommendation.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n*   We searched for studies that compared the closure of mesenteric defects with the non-closure of defects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.\n*   We analyzed the results of the included studies and calculated the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction, postoperative overall complications, postoperative mortality, and intraoperative overall complications.\n*   We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   Closing mesenteric defects may reduce the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction within 10 years after surgery (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.42; P < 0.00001, I² = 0%).\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative overall complications (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47; P = 0.35, I² = 0%).\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative mortality (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.93; P = 0.50, I² not applicable).\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of intraoperative overall complications (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.42; P = 0.59, I² not applicable).\n*   The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure than for those who did not have the defects closed (MD 0.27 days, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.38; P < 0.00001; I² = 93%).\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is very uncertain about the incidence of postoperative mortality, the incidence of intraoperative overall complications, and the length of hospital stay.\n*   The small number of trials limited our confidence in the evidence.\n*   Additional evidence based on trials designed to be at low risk of bias and with an adequate sample size is imperative.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The review is based on studies that were searched up to August 2024.\n*   The evidence is current as of the search date, but the review authors note that additional evidence may have been published since then.\n\n**Funding and registration:**\n\n*   This review was funded by [insert funding information].\n*   The protocol was registered in the Cochrane Library on 9 May 2023."
