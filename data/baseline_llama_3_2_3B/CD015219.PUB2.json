    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of favipiravir for treating COVID-19?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* We do not know whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days, or in-hospital.\n* We do not know if favipiravir reduces the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation.\n* Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital.\n* We do not know if favipiravir reduces the time to clinical improvement.\n* Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the progression to oxygen therapy.\n* Favipiravir may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events, but may not result in serious adverse events.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n**What is COVID-19?**\n\nCOVID-19 is a new coronavirus disease that has caused a pandemic worldwide. It can lead to severe respiratory problems and even death.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if favipiravir is effective in treating COVID-19, and if it has any benefits or risks.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared favipiravir to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults. The trials were conducted in many countries, and most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease. We do not know whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality, or if it reduces the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation. Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital. We do not know if favipiravir reduces the time to clinical improvement. Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the progression to oxygen therapy. Favipiravir may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events, but may not result in serious adverse events.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe do not know whether favipiravir is effective in treating COVID-19 illness, irrespective of severity or admission status. Treatment with favipiravir may result in an overall increase in the incidence of adverse events but may not result in serious adverse events.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.\n\nPlease note that this is a manual transformation, and it may not be perfect. If you need a more accurate or formal transformation, I recommend using a Plain Language Summary tool or consulting a professional."
