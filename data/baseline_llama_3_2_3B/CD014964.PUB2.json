    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of using ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults?**\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out: which types of ultrasound guidance work best to help people have successful neuraxial anaesthesia; the benefits and risks of using ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults.\n\n**What is neuraxial anaesthesia and why is it important?**\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of anaesthesia that numbs the nerves in the spine. It's used to help people who are having surgery or other medical procedures that require pain relief. However, it can be difficult to administer successfully, because the targeting space imagined by palpation of anatomical position can deviate from the actual position.\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of using ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults?**\nUltrasound guidance can help reduce the number of attempts until success or procedure termination and procedure (needling) time compared to anatomical landmarks. It may also increase the rate of first-attempt success. However, the evidence is uncertain about the effects of ultrasound guidance on participant satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and adverse effects.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure and adverse effects. The evidence is also uncertain about the effects of ultrasound guidance on participant satisfaction and technical failure. We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We included 65 studies with 6823 participants. We synthesised results for each outcome, where possible, by using a random-effects analytical model.\n\n**What did we find?**\nOur meta-analyses demonstrated that compared with anatomical landmarks, ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts until success or procedure termination (MD –0.41 attempts, 95% CI –0.51 to –0.31; 57 studies, 6192 participants; high-certainty evidence), and procedure (needling) time (MD –33.8 seconds, 95% CI –47.22 to –20.39; 43 studies, 4178 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ultrasound guidance likely increases the rate of first-attempt success (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.52; 50 studies, 5205 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\n\n**What should happen next?**\nFuture research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse effects; the benefits and risks of using ultrasound guidance for different types of neuraxial anaesthesia; and the development of new technologies to improve the accuracy of ultrasound guidance.\n\nPlease note that this is a machine-generated summary and may not be perfect. It's always best to have a human review and edit the summary to ensure accuracy and clarity."
