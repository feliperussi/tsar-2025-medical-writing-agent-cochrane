    "output": "Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nHere is the transformed Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following all guidelines above:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies for glioma?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies may not be effective in treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a type of brain cancer.\n*   These treatments may not improve overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in people with recurrent GBM.\n*   However, some studies suggest that neoadjuvant (before surgical resection) and adjuvant (after surgical resection) pembrolizumab may improve OS and PFS in people with newly diagnosed GBM.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a type of brain cancer that is difficult to treat.\n*   Researchers wanted to find out if anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies could help treat GBM.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n*   We searched for studies that compared anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies with placebo or other treatments in people with GBM.\n*   We analyzed the results of these studies to see if anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies were effective in treating GBM.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   We found seven studies that compared anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies with placebo or other treatments in people with GBM.\n*   The studies involved a total of 1953 people with GBM.\n*   The studies were conducted in different countries and had different durations.\n*   The results of the studies were mixed, but some suggested that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies may not be effective in treating GBM.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence for anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies is limited by the small number of studies and the high risk of bias in some of the studies.\n*   The evidence for the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in treating GBM is uncertain.\n*   The evidence for the safety of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies is also uncertain.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence for anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies is current as of March 2024.\n*   However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the high risk of bias in some of the studies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies may not be effective in treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).\n*   Neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab may improve overall survival and progression-free survival in people with newly diagnosed GBM.\n*   However, the evidence for the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in treating GBM is uncertain.\n*   Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in treating GBM."
