    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?**\n\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. OSF has a significant impact on eating and swallowing, affecting quality of life. There is an increased risk of oral malignancy in people with OSF. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing, and the mainstay of treatment has been behavioural interventions to support habit cessation.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for OSF and looked at the results. We found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with OSF. We assessed one study at low risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias and 24 studies at high risk of bias.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found that antioxidants may improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. However, the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings. There were some side effects reported, but it is unclear if these are related to the treatments.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence was very uncertain for all other interventions compared to placebo or no active treatment. The evidence was very uncertain for the other interventions that were compared to placebo and measured burning sensation.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Oral submucous fibrosis is a chronic disease that causes pain and reduces mouth opening. There is an increased risk of oral cancer in people with OSF. The main treatment is to help people stop chewing areca nuts.\n* We found that antioxidants may improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. However, the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n* There were some side effects reported, but it is unclear if these are related to the treatments.\n* More research is needed to find the best treatments for OSF and to understand the risks and benefits.\n* We also found that some people may experience no benefits from these treatments.\n* The evidence is not strong enough to make recommendations for or against any treatment.\n* Future research should focus on finding better treatments and understanding the risks and benefits.\n* We should also look at how to improve diagnosis and treatment of OSF.\n\nPlease note that this is a manual transformation and may not be perfect.
