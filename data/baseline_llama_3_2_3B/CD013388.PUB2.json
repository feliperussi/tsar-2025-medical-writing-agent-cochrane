    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate dementia?**\n\nCognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a solution-focused approach that helps people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain independence. We wanted to find out if CR is effective in improving everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with dementia and their care partners.\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* We found that cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities targeted in the intervention.\n* The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties.\n* Future research could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. We extracted data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. We found six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found high-certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on everyday functioning for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We found moderate-certainty evidence indicating that CR has negligible effects on anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, and general functional ability for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We found high-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life for care partners. We found moderate-certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on psychological aspects of quality of life for care partners.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022. The studies were relatively low in risk of bias, but there was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high-quality RCT.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nFuture research could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.\n\nPlease note that I've followed the guidelines provided to transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary. However, please review the summary to ensure it meets your specific requirements."
