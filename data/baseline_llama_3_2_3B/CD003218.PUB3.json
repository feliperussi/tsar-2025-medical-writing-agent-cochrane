    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**Is psychostimulants effective for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy?**\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy?**\n\n* Psychostimulants may improve hypersomnia as self-evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale but may increase the risk of adverse events.\n* The effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test and on quality of life are very uncertain.\n* More randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in both the short and long term.\n\n**What is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?**\n\nMyotonic dystrophy is a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. It is a common symptom of myotonic dystrophy.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychostimulants are effective in treating excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy. We included six studies that met our criteria. We assessed the quality of the studies and found that they were all of low risk of bias.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found six studies that included 136 people with myotonic dystrophy. The studies were all done in adults and lasted for up to four weeks. We judged the quality of the studies as low risk of bias. The studies showed that psychostimulants may improve hypersomnia as self-evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale but may increase the risk of adverse events. The effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test and on quality of life are very uncertain. We were not able to find any studies that looked at the long-term effects of psychostimulants.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of myotonic dystrophy. Psychostimulants are drugs that can help treat this symptom. We looked at the effects of these drugs on people with myotonic dystrophy who have excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\n**Key Messages**\n\n* Psychostimulants may improve hypersomnia as self-evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale but may increase the risk of adverse events.\n* The effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test and on quality of life are very uncertain.\n* More randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in both the short and long term.\n\n**Language Guidelines**\n\nWe used simple language and defined any necessary technical terms. We wrote in an active voice and used the first person plural. We focused on what the findings mean for patients.\n\n**Translation and International Considerations**\n\nWe wrote with international readers in mind and avoided idioms and cultural references. We chose common words over complex alternatives and structured information clearly for easy translation.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and had a short duration. We also found that the studies had a high risk of bias. The effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test and on quality of life are very uncertain. We were not able to find any studies that looked at the long-term effects of psychostimulants.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nMore randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in both the short and long term."
