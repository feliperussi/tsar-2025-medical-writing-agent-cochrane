    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of adding breast ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* In combination with mammography, breast ultrasonography detects more breast cancer than mammography alone, but also leads to more false-positive results and biopsies.\n* For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected more cancer cases than mammography alone.\n* However, the number of false-positive results and biopsy rates were higher in women receiving additional ultrasonography for breast cancer screening.\n* None of the included studies analyzed whether the higher number of screen-detected cancers in the intervention group resulted in a lower mortality rate compared to mammography alone.\n* Randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies with a longer observation period are needed to assess the effects of the two screening interventions on morbidity and mortality.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n**What is breast cancer screening?**\n\nBreast cancer is a common type of cancer that affects the breast tissue. Screening mammography can detect breast cancer at an early stage, which can improve treatment outcomes.\n\n**Why is breast cancer screening important?**\n\nBreast cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Early detection through screening can help reduce mortality rates.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nIn combination with mammography, breast ultrasonography detects more breast cancer than mammography alone, but also leads to more false-positive results and biopsies. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected more cancer cases than mammography alone. However, the number of false-positive results and biopsy rates were higher in women receiving additional ultrasonography for breast cancer screening. None of the included studies analyzed whether the higher number of screen-detected cancers in the intervention group resulted in a lower mortality rate compared to mammography alone. Randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies with a longer observation period are needed to assess the effects of the two screening interventions on morbidity and mortality.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We are moderately confident in the evidence because of concerns about the number of false-positive results and biopsies. The percentage of invasive tumours was similar, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Positive lymph node status was detected less frequently in women with invasive cancer who underwent mammography screening in combination with ultrasonography than in women who underwent mammography alone. Interval carcinomas occurred less frequently in the group screened by mammography and ultrasonography compared with mammography alone. False-negative results were less common when ultrasonography was used in addition to mammography than with mammography alone. The number of false-positive results and necessary biopsies were higher in the group with additional ultrasonography screening. Amongst 1000 women who do not have cancer, 37 more received a false-positive result when they participated in screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography than with mammography alone. Compared to mammography alone, for every 1000 women participating in screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography, 27 more women will have a biopsy. A secondary analysis of the J–START provided results from 19,213 women with dense and non–dense breasts. In women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected three more cancer cases per 1000 women screened than mammography alone. A meta–analysis of three cohort studies with data from 50,327 women with dense breasts supported this finding, showing that mammography and ultrasonography combined led to statistically significantly more diagnosed cancer cases compared to mammography alone. For women with non–dense breasts, the secondary analysis of the J–START study demonstrated that more cancer cases were detected when adding ultrasound to mammography screening compared to mammography alone. However, two cohort studies with data from 40,636 women found no statistically significant difference between the two screening methods.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nRandomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies with a longer observation period are needed to assess the effects of the two screening interventions on morbidity and mortality."
