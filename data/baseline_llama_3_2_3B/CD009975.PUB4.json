    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**Is videolaryngoscopy better than direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in neonates?**\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of videolaryngoscopy for neonatal endotracheal intubation?**\n\n* Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (low-certainty evidence).\n* Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence).\n* These results suggest that videolaryngoscopy may be more effective and potentially reduce harm when compared to direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in neonates.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n* The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of videolaryngoscopy on desaturation or bradycardia episodes, or both, during intubation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.30; 3 studies; 343 intubations; very-low certainty evidence).\n* Videolaryngoscopy may result in little to no difference in the lowest oxygen saturations during intubation compared with direct laryngoscopy (MD –0.76, 95% CI –5.74 to 4.23; 2 studies; 359 intubations; low-certainty evidence).\n* Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in the incidence of airway trauma during intubation attempts compared with direct laryngoscopy (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79; RD –0.04, 95% CI –0.07 to –0.01; NNTB 25, 95% CI 14 to 100; 5 studies; 467 intubations; moderate-certainty evidence).\n* There were no data available on other adverse effects of videolaryngoscopy.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for trials evaluating videolaryngoscopy for neonatal endotracheal intubation in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and BIOSIS. We also searched abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies, clinical trials registries (www.clinicaltrials.gov;www.controlled-trials.com), and reference lists of relevant studies.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 5 additional RCTs for inclusion, 7 ongoing trials, and 5 studies awaiting classification. For the primary outcomes; videolaryngoscopy may not reduce the time required for successful intubation when compared with direct laryngoscopy (mean difference [MD] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] –0.19 to 1.67; 5 studies; 505 intubations; low-certainty evidence). Videolaryngoscopy may result in fewer intubation attempts (MD –0.08, 95% CI –0.15 to 0.00; 6 studies; 659 intubations; low-certainty evidence). Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation at the first attempt (risk ratio [RR] 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.37; risk difference [RD] 0.14, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.20; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 7, 95% CI 5 to 13; 8 studies; 759 intubation attempts; low-certainty evidence)."
