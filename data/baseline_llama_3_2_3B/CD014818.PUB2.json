    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Regional analgesia techniques, such as paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB), may be effective in reducing postoperative pain.\n* However, the evidence is not very clear, and the benefits and risks of these techniques are not well understood.\n* There were no reported complications, such as block failure, local anaesthetic systemic toxicity, or nerve damage.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different regional analgesia techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. We included 39 studies with a total of 2348 participants. We analyzed the results using network meta-analyses to calculate the effects of each technique on postoperative pain and complications.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n* PEC is slightly more effective than PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at two hours.\n* ESPB is similarly effective to PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at two hours.\n* SAPB is probably as effective as PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at two hours.\n* PEC may be more effective than PVB in reducing postoperative pain during movement at two hours.\n* ESPB is similarly effective to PVB in reducing postoperative pain during movement at two hours.\n* PEC is slightly more effective than PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at 24 hours.\n* ESPB is similarly effective to PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at 24 hours.\n* SAPB is similarly effective to PVB in reducing postoperative pain at rest at 24 hours.\n* ESPB is probably as effective as PVB in reducing postoperative pain during movement at 24 hours.\n* PEC is similarly effective to PVB in reducing postoperative pain during movement at 24 hours.\n* SAPB is similarly effective to PVB in reducing postoperative pain during movement at 24 hours.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is not very clear due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. The benefits and risks of these techniques are not well understood. The evidence is also limited by heterogeneity and limited data availability.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nMore research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes and more diverse populations."
