    "output": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of education support services for children and adolescents with a chronic health condition?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Education support services can improve school engagement and academic achievement for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed.\n* There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem.\n* The current state of the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to inform effective practice and policy.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n* What is education support for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions?\n* Why is it important to improve school engagement and academic achievement for these children?\n* What do we want to find out about the effectiveness of education support services?\n\n**Background:**\n\n* Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have a big impact on education, well-being, and health.\n* These conditions are long-lasting and rarely cured completely.\n* School attendance is important for academic and social skill development, as well as well-being.\n* When children and adolescents are absent from school due to a chronic health condition, school engagement can be affected.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n* We searched eight electronic databases to find studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n* We found four studies that met our criteria for inclusion in the review.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n* There was evidence that education support improved school engagement with three of four studies favouring the intervention.\n* However, the overall certainty of evidence for these three outcomes was judged to be 'very low'.\n* There was some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem.\n* No studies measured or reported quality of life or adverse effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n* The evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to inform effective practice and policy.\n* The current state of the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to strengthen the evidence that can inform effective practice and policy.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n* The evidence is up to date to January 2021.\n\nPlease note that this is a machine-generated summary, and it may not be perfect. It's always a good idea to have a medical communication specialist review and edit the summary to ensure accuracy and clarity."
