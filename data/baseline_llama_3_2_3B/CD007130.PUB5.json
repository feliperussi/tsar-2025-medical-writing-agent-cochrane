    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of home-based versus centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   Home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in people with heart disease.\n*   There is no clear difference in the benefits of home-based and centre-based programmes for people with heart disease.\n*   More research is needed to confirm the short-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation models of delivery in the longer term.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally.\n*   Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are traditionally offered to individuals after cardiac events to aid recovery and prevent further cardiac illness.\n*   Home-based and technology-supported cardiac rehabilitation programmes have been introduced to widen access and participation, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n*   This review aims to compare the effect of home-based and supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality and morbidity, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in people with heart disease.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n*   We searched for studies that compared centre-based cardiac rehabilitation with home-based programmes in adults with myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, or who had undergone revascularisation.\n*   We included 24 trials that randomised a total of 3046 participants undergoing cardiac rehabilitation.\n*   We assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   There was no clear difference in the benefits of home-based and centre-based programmes for people with heart disease.\n*   The majority of evidence showed no significant difference in health-related quality of life up to 24 months follow-up between home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n*   Trials were generally of short duration, with only three studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months.\n*   The cost per patient of centre-based and home-based programmes was similar.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is of low certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision.\n*   Further data are needed to determine whether the short-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation models of delivery can be confirmed in the longer term.\n*   More research is needed to determine the relative clinical effectiveness and safety of home-based programmes for other heart patients, such as those with post-valve surgery and atrial fibrillation.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n*   Further data are needed to confirm the short-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation models of delivery in the longer term."
