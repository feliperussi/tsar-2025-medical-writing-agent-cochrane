    "output": "Here is the transformed Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following all guidelines:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of admission avoidance hospital at home for older people?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to patient health outcomes, but may improve satisfaction and reduce the likelihood of relocating to residential care.\n*   Admission avoidance hospital at home probably reduces costs to the health service compared with hospital admission.\n*   We did not find enough good-quality evidence to say whether admission avoidance hospital at home is better or worse than inpatient hospital care for people with different types of conditions.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   What is admission avoidance hospital at home?\n*   Why is it used?\n*   What do we want to find out about admission avoidance hospital at home?\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n*   We searched for studies that compared admission avoidance hospital at home with inpatient hospital care.\n*   We looked at the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n*   We found 20 studies that included a total of 3100 participants.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   We found that admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to patient health outcomes, but may improve satisfaction and reduce the likelihood of relocating to residential care.\n*   We found that admission avoidance hospital at home probably reduces costs to the health service compared with hospital admission.\n*   We found that hospital at home reduced the initial average hospital length of stay.\n*   We found that admission avoidance hospital at home probably reduces costs to the health service compared with hospital admission.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n*   We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had some methodological limitations.\n*   We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had some biases and limitations.\n*   We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had some limitations and biases.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n*   The evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n*   The evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nNote: The above Plain Language Summary is a simplified version of the original Cochrane abstract, and it may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of the original research."
