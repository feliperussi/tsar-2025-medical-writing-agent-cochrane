    "output": "Title\nIs ongoing treatment after the first treatment (maintenance treatment; treatment given to keep cancer under control after initial therapy) better than regular check-ups only for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL; a slow-growing blood cancer of B cells)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with CLL who responded to their first treatment, maintenance treatment (ongoing, lower-intensity treatment given after remission) probably delays the time before the disease gets worse (progression-free survival; the time someone lives without the cancer getting worse). It probably does not change how long people live overall (overall survival; the time people live from any cause). Maintenance increases side effects (adverse events; unwanted harms), including serious side effects.\n- The evidence mainly comes from anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (lab-made proteins that bind to the CD20 protein on B cells, for example rituximab or ofatumumab) and lenalidomide (a drug that changes the immune system’s activity; an immunomodulatory drug). No trials tested newer targeted drugs such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (drugs that block BTK, a protein that helps B cells survive) or BCL2 inhibitors (drugs that block BCL2, a protein that helps cells avoid death). Evidence for alemtuzumab (an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 on immune cells) was very limited and infections were a concern.\n- We need more well-designed, longer studies that compare maintenance with observation (watching a patient’s condition without giving treatment). These studies should test newer targeted drugs, measure quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), and report short- and long-term harms, including infections and reasons for stopping treatment (treatment discontinuation; stopping therapy earlier than planned).\n\nWhat is CLL and why might maintenance treatment help?\nCLL (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) is the most common adult leukaemia. It affects B cells (a type of white blood cell). CLL often cannot be cured but can be controlled. Many people respond to induction treatment (first-line therapy) and enter remission (a decrease or disappearance of signs and symptoms). Remission can last months or years, but CLL often returns. Maintenance treatment aims to keep the disease under control longer after remission.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if maintenance treatment after remission helps people with CLL:\n- live longer (overall survival),\n- delay disease worsening (progression-free survival),\n- feel and function better (quality of life),\n- or causes harms such as side effects (adverse events), stopping treatment early (treatment discontinuation), or deaths caused by treatment (treatment-related mortality).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched several databases and trial registries for randomized trials (studies that assign people randomly to different treatments). We looked for trials in adults with CLL in remission that compared maintenance treatments (anti-CD20 antibodies, lenalidomide, alemtuzumab, or newer targeted drugs) with observation or placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medicine). We pooled results when possible and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 11 randomized trials with 2,393 adults. Follow-up ranged from about 1 to 6 years. Median ages were 54 to 72. About 6 in 10 were men.\n- Trials tested anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) in 7 trials (1,679 people), lenalidomide in 3 trials (693 people), and alemtuzumab in 1 small trial (21 people). No trials tested BTK inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, or obinutuzumab.\n- Anti-CD20 maintenance probably does not change overall survival. It probably delays disease worsening (better progression-free survival). It may increase serious side effects and increases total side effects. It probably makes little or no difference to treatment-related mortality or to stopping treatment early. One trial found little or no difference in quality of life.\n- Lenalidomide maintenance probably does not change overall survival. It probably leads to a large delay in disease worsening. It may increase serious side effects and may slightly increase treatment-related mortality. Its effect on stopping treatment early is uncertain. Lenalidomide probably slightly increases total side effects. No lenalidomide trials measured quality of life.\n- For alemtuzumab the effects are very uncertain. The trial was small and infections were a concern.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with CLL?\nSome maintenance treatments can keep CLL from getting worse for longer. None have been shown to make people live longer. Maintenance increases side effects, including serious harms. We lack evidence about newer targeted drugs such as BTK inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- We judged confidence as moderate for some comparisons because people or doctors may have known which treatment was given (lack of blinding). Not all trials reported all outcomes. Trials differed in participants and treatment schedules. Some trials were small.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to January 2022."
