    "output": "How effective are diet and exercise programmes at preventing obesity (a common, chronic disease marked by an abnormally high, unhealthy amount of body fat) in children aged 5 to 11?\n\nKey messages\n- For primary-school-aged children, programmes that increase physical activity (movement and exercise) and cut sitting time (sedentary behaviour: waking activities that use very little energy, such as sitting, watching TV, or playing video games), either alone or combined with healthy eating support, probably lead to small improvements in weight status in the short to medium term. Weight was measured by BMI (body mass index: a measure that relates body weight to height) and zBMI (BMI z-score: a standardized measure showing how a child’s BMI compares with other children of the same age and sex).\n- Diet-only programmes (interventions: planned programmes to improve health) probably make little or no difference to weight. Reported harms (adverse events: unwanted events that cause harm) were rare and mostly minor (for example, minor injuries). We do not have enough high-quality information to judge harms with confidence (certainty of evidence: how sure we are that the research result is close to the true effect, rated using GRADE: a system to rate how trustworthy the overall evidence is).\n- Most studies were done in schools and high-income countries (nations with a high income per person). Few tested programmes at home or in community settings, and few included children living with disabilities. Few studies reported effects on health inequalities (differences in health or access to health care between groups, such as by income or ethnicity). This limits how well the results apply to other groups and settings.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 important?\nChildhood obesity can harm a child’s health, development, and wellbeing. Children with obesity have higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes as they grow. Habits formed in the 5 to 11 age range often continue into adolescence and adulthood. For these reasons, preventing unhealthy weight gain is a public health priority (everyone’s health, the health of the community).\n\nWhat kinds of strategies might help prevent unhealthy weight gain in children?\nPrevention focuses on everyday habits. These may include:\n- Healthy eating (diet: the things a person eats and drinks), for example more fruit and vegetables and water instead of sugary drinks.\n- More physical activity and less sedentary behaviour (sitting and screen time).\n- Better sleep.\nMost of these approaches are delivered as programmes (interventions) in schools, at home, in community settings, or in clinics. Many aim to change behaviour (behaviour change: helping people adopt and keep healthier habits).\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe asked whether programmes that change children’s eating and/or activity habits can prevent obesity in 5- to 11-year-olds. We looked at changes in BMI and zBMI. We also checked for serious adverse events (serious harms that cause major health problems, such as those needing hospital care). We compared programmes with no programme or with usual care (the care a provider would normally give).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized studies (randomized controlled trials: studies where participants are randomly put into groups) that tested such programmes for 5- to 11-year-olds. We combined results on BMI, zBMI, and serious harms at short, medium, and long follow-up times. We rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 randomized studies including 189,707 children aged 5 to 11. Most studies took place in high-income countries and most programmes were delivered in schools (111 studies). Programmes lasted from a single visit to more than 4 years; over half lasted less than 9 months. Most studies reported outcomes at least 12 weeks after baseline (baseline: an initial measurement used for comparison).\n\n- Diet-only programmes probably make little or no difference to children’s weight.\n- Activity-only programmes probably lead to a small reduction in excess body weight in the medium term (months after the programme). They may make little or no difference in the short term or long term.\n- Combined diet and activity programmes probably lead to a small reduction in excess body weight in the medium term, and may give a small short-term benefit. They may make little or no difference in the long term.\n- Few studies reported serious adverse events. For diet-only programmes we do not know the effect on harms. For activity-only and combined programmes, they may make little to no difference to serious harms. Reported harms were rare and mostly minor (for example, minor injuries).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. Studies differed in who they included and how they delivered programmes. The evidence does not cover all groups, settings, or outcomes we wanted. Few studies included children living with disabilities or assessed health inequalities. Few studies came from home and community settings. These gaps limit what we can conclude.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture studies should test programmes outside schools, include children living with disabilities, measure outcomes for longer, and report harms and impacts on health inequalities clearly. This will help show who benefits and for how long.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence up to February 2023."
