    "output": "Title\nDoes using mosquito repellent on the skin (bug spray) help prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Using mosquito repellent on the skin (topical repellent: a cream, lotion, or spray put on the skin to keep mosquitoes away) may give a small added benefit in preventing malaria, but the evidence is limited and uncertain (low-certainty evidence: we are not very confident and the true effect could be quite different).\n- In places where long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs: bed nets treated with insecticide that stays effective after many washes) or indoor residual spraying (IRS: spraying insecticide on inside walls) are already used, topical repellents probably add little or no extra protection.\n- Repellents might help some high-risk groups (high-risk population: people more likely to get malaria, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work or travel in forests), especially where people do not have nets or indoor spraying. Side effects (unwanted events or adverse events: harms or problems from a treatment) were rare and mostly mild skin irritation.\n\nWhat is malaria and how is it usually prevented?\nMalaria is a disease caused by parasites that spread to people through bites from infected mosquitoes. The most dangerous parasite is Plasmodium falciparum (the species that often causes severe illness). Malaria can cause fever, chills, and serious disease. It is common in some parts of the world (endemic areas: places where a disease is regularly present).\n\nWe mainly prevent malaria by controlling mosquitoes (vector control: actions to reduce mosquito numbers or stop bites). The main tools are LLINs and IRS. LLINs protect people while they sleep. IRS kills mosquitoes that rest on indoor walls. These tools work best for mosquitoes that bite indoors at night. They may not protect people during outdoor activities or when people are not sleeping.\n\nWhy consider topical repellents for malaria prevention?\nTopical repellents (on the skin) may close gaps left by LLINs and IRS. They may protect people who spend evenings or mornings outdoors. They may help people who do not get full protection from standard programmes, such as refugees in camps, deployed military, or forest goers (people who work in or often travel to forests).\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether topical repellents, used alone or with LLINs or IRS (background interventions: other control measures already in place), reduce malaria infections or illness. We looked at studies in general populations and in high-risk groups.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies of topical repellents in malaria-endemic areas. We combined results when possible (meta-analysis: a method that pools results from several studies). We rated how certain we were in the evidence using the GRADE system (GRADE framework: a method for judging how much confidence to place in study results).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 trials in malaria-endemic areas that tested topical repellents. Six trials provided data we could combine. Most were cluster-randomized trials (cRCTs: studies where whole groups such as villages were randomly assigned to different actions) and 1 was an individually randomized trial (each person was randomly assigned). The trials involved many thousands of people. Some trials included high-risk groups; 2 took place in refugee camps where people had no other protection.\n\nOverall, topical repellents may slightly reduce malaria, but the results are uncertain. In areas where LLINs or IRS were already used, repellents probably added little or no extra protection. In high-risk groups without other protection (for example, in refugee camps), repellents may have helped a little. Side effects (unwanted events) were uncommon and were mostly mild skin reactions. For all outcomes, our confidence in the results was low (low-certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because people in the studies may have known who got the repellent (this can cause bias: flaws in study design that favor one result). Not all studies reported all outcomes we wanted. There were too few studies to be sure of the results. Some studies used cluster designs, which require statistical correction (adjusting for clustering) and can affect the findings.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nWe need more large, well-designed studies. Preferably these should be individually randomized studies and done in high-risk settings (for example, refugee camps). Studies should check whether repellents change mosquito biting patterns (diversion: when mosquitoes avoid protected people and bite others) and should track side effects carefully.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to January 2023."
