    "output": "What are the benefits and side effects of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) (a long‑lasting disease of the mouth where the lining becomes stiff and scarred, causing pain and reduced ability to open the mouth and raising the risk of mouth cancer)?\n\nKey messages\n- Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth (substances such as certain vitamins that may reduce tissue damage) probably lower the burning feeling in the mouth. They may give a small, short‑term increase in mouth opening (the widest a person can open their mouth, usually measured between the front teeth). The change is small and may not matter in daily life.\n- Other treatments showed no clear, reliable benefit. Pentoxifylline (a drug that widens blood vessels to improve blood flow) may give a small increase in mouth opening, but the change is probably too small to be important. Jaw exercises and other medicines have unclear effects.\n- Harms (unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment) were poorly reported. Some people had brief stomach upset such as nausea (feeling sick). One surgery, abdominal fat grafting (moving healthy fat and skin from the belly to the mouth), caused serious problems and longer hospital stays for a few people. We cannot judge safety for most options.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOSF is a long‑term condition where scarring (the growth of fibrous tissue) makes the mouth stiff and painful. People find it hard to open their mouth, which limits eating, chewing, swallowing, and speaking. OSF raises the chance of mouth cancer. The main risk is chewing areca nut (the seed of the areca palm, often called betel nut, which people chew and which can cause this disease).\n\nWhat treatments are used for OSF?\nStopping areca nut chewing is the key step. Many studies also gave behavioural support to help people quit (support to stop a habit). Other approaches aim to reduce pain and burning, improve mouth opening and jaw movement (how far the jaw moves), and help day‑to‑day life. These include:\n- Medicines taken by mouth (oral medicines) or given into the mouth or applied to the mouth surface (topical; on the surface of the body). Examples are antioxidants (see above), steroids such as dexamethasone (drugs that reduce inflammation), vasodilators such as pentoxifylline (drugs that widen blood vessels), and injections of hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase (an enzyme that helps medicines move into tissues).\n- Non‑drug care such as jaw exercises and physiotherapy (exercises and physical treatments guided by a therapist to improve movement), heat, and ultrasound (a procedure using high‑energy sound waves).\n- Surgery to release tight tissue, sometimes using a graft (healthy tissue taken from one part of the body and used in another).\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know which treatments help and which are safe. We looked for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatments to compare them fairly) that compared medicines, physiotherapy, other non‑drug therapies, or surgery with a dummy treatment (placebo; looks like the treatment but has no medicine), no treatment, or another active treatment (a known treatment). We focused on whether treatments helped people eat, chew, and speak; increased mouth opening; improved jaw movement; and reduced burning pain. We also looked for harms, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), procedure discomfort, satisfaction, hospital admissions, and costs.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for trials in adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF (a biopsy is the removal of tissue for lab examination). We pooled results where possible and rated our certainty in the evidence (how confident we are that results are close to the truth, often rated high, moderate, low, or very low).\n\nResults: What did we find?\nWe found 30 randomized trials with 2,176 adults. Most studies tested many approaches and often also helped people stop chewing areca nut.\n- No trials reported whether people returned to normal eating, chewing, and speaking.\n- Antioxidants probably increase mouth opening a little at 3 to 6 months but the gain is likely too small to matter to most people. Antioxidants probably reduce the burning feeling, with large improvements seen up to and beyond 6 months.\n- Pentoxifylline may slightly increase mouth opening, but the change is small and may not be meaningful.\n- For other medicines and for jaw exercises, we do not know if they help mouth opening or burning.\n- Harms were poorly reported. Some systemic medicines (medicines that affect the whole body) caused brief stomach upset such as nausea (feeling sick). One surgical study reported serious complications and longer hospital stays for some people.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Many trials were small or had design flaws (problems that can bias results). In some studies, people may have known which treatment they received. Not all outcomes were reported. That limits what we can conclude.\n\nWhat this means for people with OSF\nAntioxidants taken by mouth probably reduce burning and may give a small short‑term gain in mouth opening. We do not have clear evidence that other treatments help. We cannot judge safety for most options because harms were not well reported. We need larger, better‑designed trials that compare promising treatments directly (head‑to‑head comparison) and measure outcomes that matter to patients (for example, eating, chewing, speaking, mouth opening, pain/burning, daily activities, and costs).\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence up to September 2022."
