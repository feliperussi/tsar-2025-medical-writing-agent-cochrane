    "output": "Title: Is tailoring the starting dose of fertility drugs using ovarian reserve tests (blood or ultrasound tests that estimate egg supply) better than using the same dose for all women having IVF (a procedure in which eggs are removed and combined with sperm outside the body to form embryos) or ICSI (a lab procedure where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found little clear benefit from choosing the starting dose based on ovarian reserve (the total number of healthy, immature eggs in the ovaries). Using ovarian reserve tests (ORTs; tests that estimate how many eggs are left and how the ovaries may respond, such as AMH, AFC, or basal FSH) may lower moderate or severe OHSS (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a complication of fertility treatment where the ovaries swell and fluid shifts in the body, causing bloating, pain, and sometimes serious illness). The effect on the most serious OHSS is uncertain. The evidence is low quality and imprecise (uncertain because of small study sizes or few events).\n- When people were grouped by predicted response (responder: a label for how strongly someone is expected to respond to IVF drugs: low, normal, or high) and given higher or lower FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone: a hormone that makes follicles and eggs grow) doses, we did not see clear changes in live birth (delivery of a living baby) rates. It is unclear whether lowering dose in predicted high responders reduces OHSS.\n- We need better studies. Future randomized controlled trials (RCTs; studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) should test clear dosing plans, measure outcomes that matter to patients (live birth, ongoing pregnancy: a pregnancy that has continued beyond an early stage, OHSS, cycle cancellation: stopping an IVF cycle before egg retrieval, multiple pregnancy like twins, side effects, and costs), and follow people long enough to see harms and benefits.\n\nWhat are IVF and ICSI, and why are hormone injections used?\n- IVF removes eggs and mixes them with sperm in the lab. ICSI injects one sperm into one egg to help fertilize it (intracytoplasmic sperm injection). We use daily hormone injections called gonadotropins (hormones that stimulate the ovaries to make eggs), most often FSH. The goal is a normal response, usually collecting about 5 to 15 eggs. Too few eggs can lower success. Too many eggs can raise side effects.\n\nWhat are ovarian reserve tests and how might they guide dosing?\n- Ovarian reserve tests (ORTs) estimate egg supply and likely ovarian response. AMH (anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone) is a blood test that reflects the number of eggs remaining. AFC (antral follicle count) is an ultrasound count of small resting follicles (a follicle is a sac that contains one egg). Basal FSH (bFSH) is a blood test early in the menstrual cycle. Doctors may use these tests to predict who will be a low, normal, or high responder and adjust the starting FSH dose instead of giving the same dose to everyone. Dose means the amount of medicine taken at one time. Doses are often given in IU (international units: a measure for the activity of hormones and drugs).\n\nWhat problems can happen with too much or too little stimulation?\n- A poor (low) response can lead to cycle cancellation (stopping treatment before egg collection). A strong or hyper-response can cause OHSS, which can be serious.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\n- We wanted to know whether choosing the starting FSH dose using ORTs improves outcomes for people having IVF or ICSI. We focused on live birth and ongoing pregnancy, and on harms such as OHSS and cycle cancellation.\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We looked for randomized trials where ORTs (AMH, AFC, or basal FSH) guided the starting FSH dose. We compared test-guided dosing with a uniform starting dose (often 150 IU) or with different doses within predicted response groups. We combined results when possible and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 26 randomized trials including 8,520 women having IVF or ICSI. Trials grouped people by ORTs as predicted low, normal, or high responders. Studies compared test-based individualized dosing algorithms with a standard starting dose or other algorithms. Main outcomes were live birth and severe OHSS.\n\nMain results\n- Test-guided starting dose probably makes little to no difference to the chance of having a baby. For example, if 25 in 100 women have a live birth with a standard starting dose, about 25 to 31 in 100 might with test-guided dosing. We rated this evidence as low to very low because of imprecision (uncertainty from small study sizes or few events) and clinical heterogeneity (studies differed in who they included and how they gave treatments).\n- Test-guided dosing may reduce moderate or severe OHSS. For example, if 5 in 100 women get moderate or severe OHSS with a standard dose, about 2 to 5 in 100 might with test-guided dosing. The effect on the most serious OHSS is unclear.\n- In predicted normal responders, a higher starting FSH dose may make little or no difference to live birth. In predicted poor responders, it is unclear whether a higher dose helps. In predicted high responders, lowering the dose may make little or no difference to live birth, and whether it reduces OHSS is uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\n- We have low confidence in the results. Some studies were not blinded (keeping participants or researchers unaware of which treatment was given to reduce bias). Some studies did not report all outcomes. Studies used different dosing plans and included different people.\n\nCurrency\n- This review updates our earlier review. The evidence is current to February 2023."
