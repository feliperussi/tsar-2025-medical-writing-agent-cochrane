    "output": "Do medicines help with acid reflux (the backward flow of liquid from the stomach into the oesophagus; the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) in babies and children?\n\nKey messages\n- We found not enough good-quality evidence that medicines help with reflux (the backward flow of liquid from the stomach into the oesophagus). Placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment that looks like the medicine but contains no active drug) and acid-reducing medicines did not consistently ease symptoms in the small, short studies we reviewed.\n- Results were similar in infants and older children. In infants, omeprazole and esomeprazole (drugs that reduce stomach acid) did not clearly reduce symptoms versus placebo. Omeprazole and ranitidine (an H2 receptor antagonist or H2 blocker; a medicine that lowers stomach acid by blocking chemical signals in the stomach) gave similar results. In older children, different doses of rabeprazole and pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitors or PPIs; medicines that strongly reduce stomach acid by blocking the stomach’s acid pump) led to similar symptom changes. Reported harms were unclear, so we cannot judge safety.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in infants and children?\nGOR means stomach contents flow back into the oesophagus (the tube from mouth to stomach). It causes spit-up, vomiting, or discomfort. It is common in babies and often improves on its own (self-limiting: gets better without treatment). If reflux causes ongoing or severe problems it may be called GORD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; reflux that needs treatment).\n\nWhy can reflux be a problem, and how do doctors usually manage it?\nReflux can cause distress, feeding problems, sleep loss, or poor weight gain. Doctors usually start with non-drug measures. These include reassurance, changing feeding amounts or timing, and thickened feeds (making milk or formula thicker to reduce spit-ups). If symptoms continue, doctors may try medicines.\n\nWhat medicines are used for reflux?\n- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole. PPIs strongly reduce stomach acid by blocking the stomach’s acid pump.\n- H2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers): ranitidine. H2 blockers lower stomach acid by blocking chemical signals in the stomach.\n- Alginates: medicines (often from seaweed) that form a protective ‘raft’ on top of stomach contents to help stop reflux.\nSome studies used pH monitoring (a test that measures how acidic the oesophagus is over time) or endoscopy (a thin tube with a camera used to look inside the oesophagus and stomach).\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these medicines help infants and children up to 16 years. We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatment groups to make fair comparisons). We compared medicines with placebo or with each other. We checked whether medicines reduced symptoms, changed test results, or caused harms.\n\nHow did we find and review the studies?\nWe searched many databases and trial registries up to September 2022, including MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL (a trial database). We extracted results about symptoms and tests. We could not combine most studies because they used different measures and designs (study design: the way a study is set up to answer a question).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 36 randomized trials including 2,251 infants and children. We could use data from 14 trials because others did not report results in a useful way.\n- Treatments usually lasted 2 to 8 weeks. The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. This means we do not have confidence in the results.\n- In infants, omeprazole and esomeprazole did not clearly reduce symptoms versus placebo. Omeprazole and ranitidine had similar effects. In newborns, esomeprazole showed no clear benefit.\n- In older children, different doses (the amount of medicine given) of rabeprazole and pantoprazole did not show clear benefit over lower doses.\n- We found little usable information on endoscopy findings (what a camera sees) or on key groups such as preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) and children with neurodisabilities (long-term conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).\n\nHow strong is the evidence?\nThe evidence is very low certainty. Studies were small and short. They used different symptom measures (symptom score: a number that shows how often or how bad symptoms are). This made it hard to combine results (meta-analysis: a method that combines results from several studies) or draw firm conclusions.\n\nWhat does this mean for families and doctors?\nWe cannot say that acid-reducing medicines help most babies or children with reflux. We also cannot judge safety from the available trials. Doctors should keep using non-drug measures first and be cautious about routine use of these medicines when benefits are uncertain.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture trials should be larger and longer. They should use the same ways to measure symptoms and report outcomes important to families (for example, crying, feeding, sleep, pain, and quality of life). Trials should clearly record harms and doses. We also need trials in preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Studies were heterogeneous (made up of parts that are not alike). Many outcomes were not reported. The evidence does not cover all groups or outcomes we wanted.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our prior Cochrane review. The evidence is current to September 2022."
