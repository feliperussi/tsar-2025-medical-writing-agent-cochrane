    "output": "Title: How accurate are the HINTS (a simple bedside eye movement test) and HINTS Plus (adds a hearing check) exams for detecting brain causes (such as stroke) of sudden, ongoing dizziness?\n\nKey messages\n- In adults with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) (sudden, ongoing dizziness or vertigo that lasts hours to days and often includes nausea, vomiting, abnormal eye movements, and trouble walking), HINTS (a 3-part bedside eye exam: Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) and HINTS Plus (HINTS plus a quick hearing check) often identified a brain cause (central cause: a brain-based reason for dizziness, such as stroke). But they missed some brain causes and sometimes indicated a brain cause when there was none.\n- Video-assisted HINTS (using goggles or cameras to record and measure eye movements more precisely) did not clearly improve accuracy across the few studies. Most evidence came from emergency departments (EDs) (the hospital area that treats sudden or serious problems) and from physicians, often neurologists (doctors with special training in nervous system disorders). We cannot be sure how well the tests work with other providers or in other settings.\n- The evidence is limited and of low certainty. We need more well-designed studies across different providers, training levels, and settings. We also need studies that measure how often different clinicians agree on results (inter-rater reliability: how consistently different clinicians get the same result) and how timing, decision-making, harms, and costs are affected.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why does it matter?\nDizziness is a common reason people seek care. Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) (sudden, ongoing dizziness or vertigo with nausea and trouble walking) can come from the inner ear or balance nerve (peripheral cause: an inner ear or balance-nerve problem) or from the brain (central cause: a brain-based reason such as ischemic stroke, where a blocked blood vessel damages part of the brain). Telling these apart matters because treatments and outcomes differ.\n\nWhat are the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests?\nHINTS is an index test (the test we evaluated) made of 3 bedside checks to help tell peripheral from central causes. The parts are:\n- Head Impulse test (a quick check where the clinician rapidly turns your head while you fix your gaze to see if your eyes stay on the target).\n- Nystagmus (involuntary, repetitive eye movements you cannot control).\n- Test of Skew (an eye alignment check where one eye is briefly covered and then uncovered to see if the eyes jump vertically).\nHINTS Plus adds a quick hearing check (an assessment of auditory function). Clinicians can do the tests by eye (clinician visual assessment) or with video assistance (video-assisted HINTS) that records eye movements.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well HINTS and HINTS Plus detect a central cause of AVS. We compared the tests to a reference standard (the best available method to find the true diagnosis, usually MRI: a machine that takes pictures inside the body using strong magnets and radio waves, or a neurologist’s final diagnosis). We also looked at who did the tests, where they were done, when after symptom onset they were done, and which parts were most useful.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched databases up to September 2022 for studies that measured diagnostic accuracy (how well a test finds people with and without a condition). We combined study results and judged study quality and our certainty in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 16 diagnostic accuracy studies with 2,024 adults (mean age 60). Twelve studies evaluated HINTS and 5 evaluated HINTS Plus.\n- Most studies took place in EDs. About half of tests were done by neurologists; other clinicians also did tests.\n- Few studies used video-assisted HINTS (3 studies) or video-assisted HINTS Plus (2 studies).\n- Most studies used MRI or a specialist’s final diagnosis as the reference standard.\n- When trained clinicians used HINTS, it may improve correct identification of a central cause in ED settings. HINTS Plus may also help. Video-assisted HINTS Plus probably increases correct identification a little. It is unclear whether video-assisted HINTS alone helps.\n- No direct harms from performing the exams were reported.\n- Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\n- Most studies were done in EDs and by trained physicians, often neurologists. This raises applicability concerns (questions about how well study patients, tests, or settings match real-world care).\n- Few studies used video tools or included non-specialist providers.\n- Study methods and reporting varied. The small amount of evidence reduces our confidence.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nHINTS and HINTS Plus, when done by trained clinicians, can help detect brain causes of sudden, ongoing dizziness. They are not perfect and can miss cases or give false alarms. Clinicians should use these tests alongside clinical history, risk factors, and imaging when needed. We need more research that includes different providers, measures inter-rater reliability, and compares these exams with usual care and brain scans to understand effects on decisions, harms, and costs.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
