    "output": "Title: Do stimulant medicines help with excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a genetic muscle-wasting disease)?\n\nKey messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know for sure whether stimulant medicines (psychostimulants: drugs that help people stay awake and feel alert) help adults with myotonic dystrophy (an inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and difficulty relaxing muscles) who have excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia: excessive sleepiness during the day, with trouble staying awake). Psychostimulants may slightly reduce sleepiness on a questionnaire (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: a short questionnaire where people rate how likely they are to doze in everyday situations). Effects on sleep lab tests (objective tests: measures of how well someone stays awake or how quickly they fall asleep) and on day-to-day well-being (quality of life: how someone feels and functions day to day) are unclear. Unwanted effects (adverse events: side effects that harm the person) may be more common, but the evidence is weak.\n- The studies were small (total 136 people), included only adults, and mostly lasted up to 4 weeks. Most used a cross-over design (a study where each person receives more than one treatment in sequence, so they act as their own control). Results varied and we could not tell which medicine (for example, modafinil: a stimulant drug being studied to treat fatigue) or which people might benefit most.\n- We need larger, longer, well-designed trials that measure both how people feel and how they do on sleep tests, report quality of life, and include more types of people.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why does daytime sleepiness matter?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a lifelong genetic condition that mainly affects muscles. It causes weakness and trouble relaxing muscles. It can also affect the brain and how it controls sleep. Many people have hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness). Daytime sleepiness can make it hard to concentrate, work, study, or drive. It can lower quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day).\n\nWhat are psychostimulants and how might they help?\nPsychostimulants are medicines that promote wakefulness and alertness. Doctors use them in other sleep conditions such as narcolepsy and sometimes for attention problems. In myotonic dystrophy, doctors may prescribe psychostimulants such as modafinil. These medicines can cause side effects (adverse events). That is why we need clear evidence on benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychostimulant medicines reduce daytime sleepiness, improve daily functioning and quality of life, and cause unwanted effects. We aimed to assess short- and long-term benefits and harms and to judge how confident we are in the evidence (certainty of evidence: an overall judgement of how sure we are that the results reflect the true effect).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov: a public U.S. website listing clinical studies) and checked reference lists for studies. We looked for studies in people with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness that compared psychostimulants with placebo (a dummy treatment that looks like the medicine but has no active drug) or no treatment. We collected results for self-reported sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), sleep lab tests such as the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (a daytime test that measures how well a person can stay awake) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (a daytime test that measures how quickly a person falls asleep), quality of life, and side effects. We rated the trustworthiness of the evidence using GRADE (a system to judge how trustworthy the evidence is).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with 136 adults aged 18 to 70. Most studies lasted up to 4 weeks. No studies included children. Most were cross-over trials (each person received both medicine and placebo at different times). The medicines tested were psychostimulants, including modafinil. Psychostimulants may reduce sleepiness as people reported on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. It is unclear if psychostimulants help on objective tests (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test) or if they improve quality of life. Psychostimulants may raise the chance of unwanted effects (adverse events). We do not know about long-term benefits or harms.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are not confident. The studies were small, short, and varied in design and participants. This raises concerns about imprecision (results are uncertain because there are too few participants) and inconsistency (different studies give conflicting results). There may also be flaws in study methods (risk of bias).\n\nWhat does this mean for people?\nIf you have myotonic dystrophy and daytime sleepiness, psychostimulants might help a little for self-reported sleepiness. They might cause more side effects. You and your doctor should weigh possible small benefits against possible harms. We need larger, longer trials that measure both how people feel and how they perform on sleep tests and that report effects on quality of life.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
