    "output": "Which types, doses, and timing (when to start and for how long) of nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lozenges, or spray) help people quit smoking best?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (NRT = a treatment using products that give small, steady doses of nicotine to relieve cravings and withdrawal; examples include nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal or mouth spray) — a nicotine patch (a skin patch that releases nicotine slowly through the skin) plus a fast-acting product (products that deliver nicotine quickly, such as gum, lozenge, or mouth or nasal spray) — helps more people stay smoke-free for at least 6 months than using one product alone (high-certainty evidence = very trustworthy evidence where further research is unlikely to change our confidence). Using a fast-acting product alone works about as well as using a patch alone.\n- Higher-dose products (dose = the amount of medicine given, for example 4 mg gum versus 2 mg gum) and starting NRT before the quit day (preloading = starting NRT while still smoking before the planned quit day) may help a little. This is less certain (moderate-certainty evidence = fairly trustworthy but further research could change the estimate).\n- We did not find clear differences for how long to use NRT (duration = length of treatment). We also did not find clear differences between different fast-acting products. Side effects (adverse events = any unwanted medical sign or symptom) were reported inconsistently. Serious adverse events (SAEs = medical problems that are life-threatening, need hospital care, cause major disability, or cause death) were rare.\n\nWhy is stopping smoking hard?\nSmoking causes serious disease and early death. Nicotine (an addictive chemical in tobacco) causes craving and withdrawal (withdrawal = the physical and mental symptoms that happen when someone cuts back or stops an addictive drug). NRT provides nicotine without tobacco smoke. NRT can ease cravings and make quitting easier.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which ways of using NRT work best and are safest to help people quit for the long term (we measured outcomes at least 6 months). Follow-up means the time we contact or check people after treatment to see if they remain smoke-free.\n\nHow did we review the evidence?\nWe looked for randomized trials (a randomized trial assigns people by chance to different groups to compare treatments). We included trials that compared different NRT forms; single-form NRT (only one product) versus combination NRT (patch plus fast-acting product); different doses; different durations; and starting NRT before or on the quit day (quit day = the planned day when a person stops smoking). We included trials with at least 6 months’ follow-up. We pooled results and judged how certain the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 68 randomized trials with 43,327 adults. All trials measured quitting at least 6 months after starting. The studies compared patches, fast-acting products (gum, lozenge, or sprays), combination NRT, different doses, preloading versus starting on the quit day, and different durations.\n\nWhich NRT options work best?\n- Combination NRT (patch plus fast-acting product) helped more people quit than single-form NRT (high-certainty evidence).\n- Fast-acting products alone and patches alone had similar quit rates (quit rate = the proportion of people who stopped smoking at a set time) (high-certainty evidence).\n- Starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) probably helps a little more than starting on the quit day (moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Higher-dose gum (4 mg versus 2 mg) worked better (high-certainty evidence). Standard 24-hour patches probably work better than lower-dose patches. Increasing patch dose beyond standard made little or no difference (moderate-certainty evidence). For 16-hour patches, higher dose may help a little (moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Changing how long people use patches or combination NRT likely makes little or no difference. We are uncertain whether one fast-acting product is better than another because the evidence was limited.\n\nWhat about side effects?\nSide effects and serious harms were reported inconsistently. Adverse events were rare overall. No clear differences in serious harms (SAEs) appeared between NRT types or schedules. In one study, more people stopped treatment because of side effects (withdrawals due to treatment = people who drop out because of side effects) with nicotine nasal spray than with patches. High-dose patches caused more withdrawals in a few small studies.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence overall. Some trials may have been unblinded so participants knew their treatment. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. Some findings relied on few events and few people, which makes the estimates less precise (imprecision = uncertainty because of few participants or wide ranges around the result).\n\nWhat does this mean for people who want to quit?\nWe think combination NRT (patch plus fast-acting product) gives the best chance to quit long term. Fast-acting products alone work about as well as patches alone. Higher doses and preloading may help some people, but the evidence is less certain. Side effects are uncommon.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture trials should directly compare doses, timing (preloading versus starting on the quit day), and duration. Trials should include enough people to give reliable answers and should report side effects and reasons for stopping treatment in a consistent way.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our earlier review and includes evidence up to April 2022."
