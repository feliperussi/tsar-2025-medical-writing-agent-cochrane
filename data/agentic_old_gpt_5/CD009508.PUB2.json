    "output": "Title: Which ways of doing pelvic floor exercises (to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder) work best for women with bladder leakage?\n\nKey messages\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT; repeated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles â€” the sling of muscles at the bottom of the pelvis that support the bladder, uterus, and bowel and help control urination and bowel movements) may help women with urinary incontinence (inability to hold urine in the bladder) more than exercises that do not target these muscles. Programs that pair PFMT squeezes with body movements may help a little. Training on more days per week might help more, but the evidence is weak.\n- How PFMT is delivered often makes little difference to quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). One-to-one supervision and group supervision appear similarly helpful. We are unsure if clinic supervision is better than home practice or support by an app or the internet (e-health, health care delivered using digital tools like websites or mobile apps). E-health may be a little better than written instructions.\n- Side effects were uncommon. When reported, they were usually mild and linked to resistance devices (tools often placed in the vagina or rectum that give resistance or feedback), causing discharge (fluid that comes out of the body), spotting (light vaginal bleeding between periods), or discomfort.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\n- Urinary incontinence means leaking urine when you do not want to (inability to hold urine in the bladder). It is common in women and can be embarrassing and upsetting. It can limit daily activities, exercise, social life, and sleep. It can affect mental wellbeing.\n- Types include stress incontinence (leakage with coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise), urge incontinence (a sudden, strong need to pass urine that is hard to hold), and mixed incontinence (having both stress and urge symptoms).\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)?\n- PFMT is a program of exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles (the sling of muscles at the bottom of the pelvis that support the bladder, uterus, and bowel and help control urination and bowel movements). People learn to tighten and relax these muscles regularly.\n- Clinicians (health professionals who take care of patients) often teach the exercises, and people then practise at home.\n\nHow can PFMT be done in different ways?\n- Exercise type:\n  - Direct PFMT means repeated, isolated, voluntary squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles (squeezes you do without being forced).\n  - Coordinated training pairs a pelvic floor squeeze with body movements, such as squats, so the muscles work during tasks you do in daily life.\n  - Indirect training uses exercises that do not directly squeeze the pelvic floor but may work related muscles (for example, core or hip exercises).\n- Dose: Dose means the amount and schedule of exercises (how hard to squeeze, how many repetitions, and how many days per week).\n- Delivery: We can teach PFMT one-to-one (with a clinician) or in groups. We can teach it in a clinic or at home. We can give support by app or internet (e-health, health care delivered using digital tools like websites or mobile apps). Some programs use resistance devices (tools placed in the vagina or rectum that give resistance or feedback).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We compared different exercise types, different doses, and different delivery methods for women with stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence. We also looked for harms (adverse events, unwanted effects) and how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nHow did we do the review?\n- We searched for trials that compared different PFMT approaches for women with stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence. We grouped similar studies, combined results when possible, noted harms, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 63 trials with 4,920 women. Most participants were middle-aged and had given birth (parous, having given birth). Women with neurological conditions (related to the brain and nervous system), or who were pregnant or recently postpartum (the time after birth), were not included.\n- All trials included direct PFMT. Direct PFMT probably improves quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) more than exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor.\n- Adding non-PFMT exercises to direct PFMT likely makes little or no difference. Combining PFMT squeezes with body movements may slightly improve outcomes.\n- Training on more days per week may help more, but this finding comes from a small study and is uncertain. Using resistance devices may not help and could be less helpful, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Delivery method often made little difference. One-to-one versus group supervision probably makes little or no difference in quality of life. Clinic supervision may be a little better than home practice, but the evidence is very uncertain. E-health may be slightly better than written instructions.\n- Side effects were uncommon: 66 of 1,083 women (6%) had an adverse event, mostly linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices (placed inside the vagina or rectum) causing discharge, spotting, or discomfort.\n\nHow certain are these findings?\n- Many studies were small or had design problems. People likely knew which treatment they were getting, which can bias results. Most participants were middle-aged women with stress or stress-predominant mixed leakage, so results may not apply to all women. For many comparisons our certainty was low or very low.\n\nWhat does this mean for women with bladder leakage?\n- We think direct PFMT is a reasonable first choice for women with bladder leakage. We need larger, well-designed trials that directly compare exercise schedules (dose), delivery methods, long-term effects, harms, and costs.\n\nCurrency\n- This review updates our earlier review. The evidence is current to September 2023."
