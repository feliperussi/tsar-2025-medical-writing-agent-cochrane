    "output": "Does using bronchoscopy (a procedure that uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera passed through the nose or mouth to look inside the airways and lungs) to choose antibiotics work better than usual care for people with cystic fibrosis (a hereditary disease that makes thick, sticky mucus that can block the airways and cause repeated lung infections)?\n\nKey messages\n- Using bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; during bronchoscopy a small amount of sterile fluid is washed into part of the lung and then suctioned back to collect samples from the lower airways for testing) to choose antibiotics did not show clear benefits over usual care guided by throat swabs (a sample taken from the back of the mouth and throat with a swab) and symptoms in the child studies we found. We saw no clear differences in lung function (how well the lungs help a person breathe), CT scans (Computerized Tomography; a way to take detailed pictures inside the body using a type of radiation and a computer), growth or nutrition (measures such as weight and height), flare-ups (pulmonary exacerbations; sudden worsening of lung symptoms that usually need extra treatment), or in finding or clearing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a type of bacteria that can cause lung infections and is often hard to treat).\n- Harms from bronchoscopy/BAL were mostly mild and short-lived (for example, temporary worse cough). Some people had short-term clinical worsening soon after BAL. Bronchoscopy-guided care may increase hospital stays (time admitted to hospital). Quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) and costs of care (a comparison of healthcare costs such as hospital stays, tests, and medicines) were similar between the approaches.\n- We need larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign people to different treatments so the groups are comparable) in children and adults. These should measure breathing, flare-ups, hospital stays, quality of life, unwanted effects (adverse events; unwanted events that cause harm), longer-term outcomes, and who might benefit most (for example, people who cannot produce sputum, which is mucus brought up from the lungs by coughing).\n\nWhat is this review about?\n- We asked whether choosing antibiotics based on bronchoscopy/BAL results (samples taken from the lower airways during the procedure) works better than standard care based on sputum or throat/cough swabs (tests that look for germs in mucus or from the back of the throat). We wanted to know effects on lung health, infection control, quality of life, hospital stays, costs, and harms.\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched for studies in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. We looked for trials that compared bronchoscopy/BAL-guided antibiotic choices with usual care guided by sputum or throat/cough swabs. We combined results when measures matched and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 2 randomized trials with 200 children in total. One study included 170 babies found by newborn screening (tests done shortly after birth to look for certain conditions) and followed them to age 5 (results available for 157). The other enrolled 30 children aged 5–18 and followed them for 2 years.\n- Overall, bronchoscopy/BAL-guided antibiotics probably made little to no difference to lung function, CT scan findings, growth or nutrition, quality of life, flare-ups, or detecting and clearing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It probably made little to no difference to costs. It may increase hospital stays.\n\nWhat are the main limits?\n- We have low confidence in the evidence. There are only 2 child studies. The studies used different methods (for example, one used lung clearance index, a breathing test number that shows how evenly air moves through the lungs, to decide when to do bronchoscopy). People or staff may have known which treatment was given. Not all outcomes were reported.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We need larger, high-quality randomized trials in both children and adults. They should measure the key outcomes listed above and track adverse events over time. They should also test who is most likely to benefit.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\n- The evidence is up to date to November 2023."
