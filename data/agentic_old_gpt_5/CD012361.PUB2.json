    "output": "Title\nIs dexmedetomidine (a medicine used to calm and relieve pain that works on alpha-2 receptors, a type of nerve receptor that lowers stress signals) better and safer than other medicines to relieve pain and keep newborn babies on breathing machines calm?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no completed trials that directly compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines for newborns on mechanical ventilation (a life-support treatment where a machine helps a person breathe, often through a tube in the windpipe). Because of this, we do not know if dexmedetomidine works better or is safer.\n- Four studies are ongoing or awaiting assessment. Two compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl (a very strong, fast-acting opioid pain medicine). One compares it with morphine (a common opioid pain medicine). One mixed-age study includes echocardiography (an ultrasound procedure to take pictures of the heart). Planned sample sizes (the number of participants) range from 40 to 200 newborns.\n- We need well-designed randomized trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to treatments to fairly compare which works best) that measure pain relief (analgesia), calmness (sedation, a state of calmness, relaxation, or sleepiness caused by certain drugs), need for extra medicines, time on mechanical ventilation, unwanted effects such as hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure), death before leaving hospital, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (how a child’s brain and nervous system develop over time).\n\nWhy do newborn babies on breathing machines need pain relief and calming?\nSome newborns are very sick and need mechanical ventilation. The breathing tube and intensive care can cause pain and stress. We give medicines for pain relief (analgesia) and to keep babies calm (sedation). These medicines reduce pain, lower stress, and stop sudden movements that could interfere with care.\n\nWhat is dexmedetomidine and how might it differ from medicines already used?\nDexmedetomidine is a medicine that calms and relieves discomfort. It works on alpha-2 receptors (a type of receptor in the nervous system that lowers stress signals). Clinicians think it may have less effect on breathing and a different haemodynamic profile (how a treatment affects blood flow and circulation, including blood pressure and heart rate) than some other sedatives. Doctors often use opioids (strong pain medicines such as morphine and fentanyl) in newborns. Opioids can slow breathing and change blood pressure. Dexmedetomidine is used more often in babies even though it is not licensed for routine use in newborns.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether dexmedetomidine gives good pain relief and calmness to newborns on mechanical ventilation, and whether it is safe. We looked for trials that compared dexmedetomidine with opioids, other non-opioid medicines, or placebo (an inactive treatment given like the real drug). We planned to measure pain, calmness, need for extra medicines, time on the breathing machine, unwanted effects such as hypotension or slow heart rate, death before going home, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries (public listings of clinical studies) up to September 2023. We looked for randomized or quasi-randomized trials (random assignment or assignment by a non-random method). We planned to combine study findings and rate our confidence using Cochrane methods (standardized procedures to find and analyze research). We found no eligible completed trials.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no completed randomized or quasi-randomized trials that met our criteria. Because of this, we do not know whether dexmedetomidine helps with pain or calmness, reduces time on mechanical ventilation, lowers the need for extra medicines, causes hypotension, affects death before leaving hospital, or changes long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nAre there studies in progress?\nYes. We found 4 studies that are ongoing or awaiting assessment:\n- 2 compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborns having surgery (an operation).\n- 1 compares dexmedetomidine with morphine in babies with perinatal asphyxia (birth asphyxia, a lack of oxygen around birth) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (cooling therapy, a treatment that gently lowers a newborn’s body temperature to help protect the brain).\n- 1 mixed-age study (up to 3 years) will compare dexmedetomidine with ketamine plus dexmedetomidine (ketamine is an anesthetic and sedative that often preserves breathing and blood pressure).\nPlanned sample sizes range from 40 to 200 newborns. These studies may provide evidence on benefits and harms in the future.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are no completed trials to answer our questions. The available information does not cover all the people, treatments, comparisons, and outcomes we wanted to study.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nWe need well-designed randomized trials that fairly compare dexmedetomidine with current treatments. Trials should measure pain relief, calmness, need for extra medicines, time on mechanical ventilation, unwanted effects such as hypotension, death before leaving hospital, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
