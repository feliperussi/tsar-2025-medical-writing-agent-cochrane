    "output": "Title: Is removing the bladder tube (urinary catheter: a flexible tube used to drain urine from the bladder) sooner after a kidney transplant better than waiting longer?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found too little reliable evidence to know whether removing the bladder tube (catheter) earlier or later after a kidney transplant (surgery to place a donated kidney) is better. The effects on urinary tract infection (UTI: infection of the urinary system), asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without symptoms), and major urological complications (serious problems with the urinary tract that may need treatment) are unclear.\n- We need well-designed randomized trials (studies that assign people to groups by chance) that follow people longer and report important outcomes clearly, such as symptomatic UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and major urological complications.\n\nWhat is a kidney transplant and why are urinary catheters used?\nWe offer a kidney transplant (a surgical procedure to place a donated kidney) when kidneys fail. During the transplant, surgeons put a urinary catheter (a flexible tube to drain urine) into the bladder (the organ that stores urine). This keeps urine flowing and reduces strain on the new join between the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) and the bladder. That surgical join (anastomosis: a surgical connection) is thought to heal better if the bladder stays empty.\n\nWhy does the timing of catheter removal matter?\nCatheters can protect the surgical join but can let bacteria into the bladder and cause infection (infection: germs growing in the body). The longer a catheter stays in, the higher the chance of UTI or bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine). Removing the catheter too soon might raise the chance of the surgical join leaking or breaking (anastomotic breakdown: the surgical connection coming apart). Because of these trade-offs, doctors do not know the best time to remove the catheter after transplant.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe compared early catheter removal (within 5 days) with later removal (5 days or more) after kidney transplant. We looked for differences in:\n- symptomatic UTI (UTI with symptoms such as pain or burning when passing urine),\n- asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without symptoms), and\n- major urological complications (problems such as leaks or blockages that need treatment).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared early versus later catheter removal after kidney transplant. We combined study results when possible and judged how certain the evidence is using standard methods (for example, GRADE: a system to rate how certain we are about the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 small studies with 197 people in total. One was a full journal article. The other was a conference abstract (a short meeting summary with limited detail). Both compared catheter removal within 5 days versus removal at 5 days or more. Follow-up (the period after treatment when researchers check on people) was short; no study followed people for more than 1 month. The studies did not report details about who the donors or recipients were, where the studies took place, or who funded the studies.\n\nWe are uncertain whether early removal changes the chance of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The evidence for this outcome is very uncertain. The studies did not give enough usable data to tell whether early removal changes the risk of symptomatic UTI or of serious urological complications that need treatment. Overall, the evidence is not reliable enough to say whether early or later catheter removal is better.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- People in the studies might have known which timing they received, which can affect results (bias: flaws in how a study is designed or done that favor one result).\n- Not all outcomes we wanted were reported.\n- The studies involved different groups of people and were short.\n- There are only a few studies, so we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe searches are up to date to April 2023.\n\nWhat do the technical terms mean?
