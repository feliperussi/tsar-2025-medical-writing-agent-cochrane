    "output": "Do strengthening exercises help people with jumper’s knee (patellar tendinopathy, a condition where the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone becomes irritated or damaged, causing pain at the front of the knee)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found too little good-quality evidence to show that strengthening exercises help people with jumper’s knee more than no treatment (a control group that receives no additional interventions), a steroid injection (glucocorticoid injection; a shot of steroid medicine to reduce inflammation and pain), or surgery (an operation to repair or remove tissue). We are uncertain about effects on pain and function. Return to sport (resuming full or partial participation in sport) looked similar to surgery in the trials. No study reported harms (unwanted effects).\n- All trials included athletes (mostly young men). Trials were small and had design limits. For example, participants and clinicians knew the treatment given. None used a placebo or sham (a fake treatment that looks real). These issues make the results uncertain.\n- Future trials should be larger and better designed. They should compare different exercise types and other treatments, follow people longer, include athletes and non‑athletes, measure outcomes that matter to patients, and record harms. Quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) should be measured.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee) causes pain at the front of the knee. The patellar tendon (the tough tissue that joins muscle to bone) links the kneecap to the shin. The condition often affects people who jump or run, but anyone can get it. Pain can make stairs, squats, and exercise hard. Symptoms can last months or years.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether strengthening exercises help people with patellar tendinopathy. We looked for benefits and harms on pain, function, return to sport, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we choose studies and what did we do?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registers up to September 2023. We looked for randomized trials (studies where people are assigned by chance to different treatments) that compared strengthening exercise with no treatment, placebo/sham (a fake treatment), or other treatments such as steroid injection or surgery. We collected results and judged how confident we are in them (certainty of evidence; how sure we are that the study results show the true effect).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 small randomized trials with 211 people. All were athletes. About 88% were men. Average age was 26 and symptoms lasted about 3.5 years. Trials tested different strengthening programmes: eccentric exercises (muscle works while it lengthens, for example slowly lowering in a squat), concentric exercises (muscle shortens as it works, for example standing up from a squat), combined eccentric–concentric exercises (both phases in one movement), and isometric exercises (muscle tenses without moving the joint, for example holding a partial squat). Trials compared exercise with no treatment (3 trials), steroid injection (1), surgery (1), stretching (1), or pulsed ultrasound with friction therapy (1). Pulsed ultrasound (short bursts of sound waves) aims to help tissues heal. Friction therapy (rubbing across tendon fibers) is a manual technique some therapists use. No trial used a placebo or sham. Outcomes were usually measured at the end of treatment. One trial followed people for 12 months. No trial reported harms.\n\nAcross the trials we are uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared with no treatment. Exercise may make little or no difference to function compared with no treatment. Compared with steroid injection, exercise may make little or no difference to pain or function at the end of treatment. Compared with surgery, we are uncertain about effects on pain and function. Exercise may make little or no difference to people’s overall rating of success or to returning to sport.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are not confident. Trials were small. People and clinicians knew who received which treatment, which can bias results (make them less reliable). Not all outcomes were reported. No trial used a placebo or sham. The evidence applies only to athletes in these trials. These limits lower the certainty of the findings.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nWe cannot say whether strengthening exercise is better than no treatment, steroid injection, or surgery for jumper’s knee. Exercise remains a common option, but its benefit is uncertain based on current evidence for athletes. Clinicians should discuss this uncertainty with patients and consider individual needs and preferences.\n\nWhat should future research do?\n- Run larger, well-designed randomized trials.  \n- Compare different exercise types and other treatments.  \n- Include athletes and non‑athletes.  \n- Follow people longer and measure pain, function, return to sport, quality of life, and harms.\n\nCurrency: We searched up to September 2023."
