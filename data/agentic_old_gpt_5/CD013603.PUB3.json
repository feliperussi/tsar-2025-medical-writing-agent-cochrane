    "output": "Title\nHow do healthcare workers view and experience primary care (PHC: the first level of care where people get most day-to-day services like check-ups and vaccinations) integration (PHC integration: bringing separate primary care services together so patients can get coordinated care in one place or from one team)?\n\nKey messages\n- Healthcare workers report a wide range of views and day-to-day experiences of PHC integration. This was a scoping review (a study that maps what research exists rather than tests effects). Because the studies used many methods and settings, we cannot say whether integration gives consistent benefits or harms for workers or patients.\n- Most studies used cross-sectional qualitative designs (interviews or focus groups: group interviews to learn what people think, done at one time). Few used longitudinal designs (collecting data from the same people at multiple times) or ethnographic methods (long-term observation in real-life settings). Studies looked at many services and worker roles.\n- Future research should study specific types of integration and settings, use clear guiding frameworks (conceptual model: a diagram or plan that shows how key factors relate), include more longitudinal and ethnographic work, and report both positive experiences and unwanted effects for workers and patients.\n\nWhat is PHC integration and why does it matter?\nWe mean PHC integration (bringing services together so people get more care in one place or from one team). Many services run as vertical programmes (single-issue programmes that focus on one disease, such as HIV or TB). Integration aims to reduce repeated tests, missed referrals, and care gaps. It can help move toward universal health coverage (UHC: everyone can get needed health services without financial hardship). Results vary, especially in low-resource settings (places with limited staff, money, medicines, or equipment). We need to know why.\n\nWhy focus on healthcare workers’ views and experiences?\nHealthcare workers include doctors, nurses, midwives, allied healthcare professionals (licensed workers such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, and lab technologists), lay healthcare workers (community members with basic health training), managers, and health system support staff (non-clinical workers like administrators and cleaners). They put integration into practice. Their perceptions and experience (what they have lived through) can help integration succeed or cause it to struggle. How teams are organised, whether staff get support and training, and how services are linked or expanded affect patient care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to map qualitative evidence (non-numeric research using interviews, focus groups, or observation) on how healthcare workers view and experience PHC integration. We asked:\n- Where were studies done and in which sectors (sector: parts of the health system or community)?\n- Which services were integrated (for example, mental health; HIV (human immunodeficiency virus: the virus that causes AIDS); tuberculosis (TB: a bacterial lung disease); sexual and reproductive health (SRH: care related to pregnancy, childbirth, contraception, and sexually transmitted infections); maternal health: care for mothers; non-communicable diseases (NCDs): long-term illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes)?\n- How was integration designed (horizontal integration: coordinating services at the same care level; service expansion: adding new services to existing clinics; service linkage strategies: ways to connect separate services such as referrals or shared records)?\n- Which worker and client target populations (the people a program is meant to serve) were involved?\n- What methods were used (mixed methods: combining qualitative and quantitative approaches; observational studies: watching and recording without changing care)?\n\nMethods\nWe used systematic search methods (planned, transparent ways to find studies). We looked for studies from any country that reported healthcare workers’ views and experiences of integrated PHC. We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies and grey literature (reports not in academic journals, such as government papers). We screened records, did data extraction (pulling key information from each study into a standard form), and mapped study features using counts and short descriptions. We did not rate confidence in the evidence because this is a scoping review.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 184 qualitative or mixed-methods studies (reported in 191 papers).\n- Most studies were recent, with a rise in the last 5 years.\n- Most used cross-sectional qualitative design (a one-time snapshot). Few used longitudinal design or ethnographic design. Few used a guiding analytical conceptual model.\n- Studies came from 37 countries and split roughly between high-income countries (HICs: countries with high national income) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The USA, South Africa, and Uganda were commonly represented.\n- Participants included policy-makers, managers at different levels, clinicians, allied and lay health workers, and support staff.\n- Integration covered 6 service areas: mental and behavioural health; HIV and TB; sexual, reproductive and maternal health; NCDs; general PHC services; and allied or specialised services.\n- Interventions (treatments, programmes, or actions taken to improve health) ranged from partial to full integration and used strategies such as horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkages.\n- The studies varied widely in topic, setting, worker groups, and methods. Because they focus on experience and are so diverse, we cannot say which form of integration works best or whether integration improves care outcomes (outcome: the overall results of a study).\n\nWhat are the main limits?\n- The evidence is diverse across people, settings, and ways of integrating services. It does not cover all groups or outcomes we wanted.\n- Many studies used small samples or single time points, so they give snapshots rather than changes over time.\n- The included studies form only a subset of all intervention studies. This may overstate benefits or miss harms that were not reported in a systematic way (systematic: planned and orderly).\n\nCurrency\nWe included evidence up to July 2020.\n\nWhat should future research do?\n- Study specific types of integration in clear contexts.\n- Use guiding frameworks and report both positive experiences and unwanted effects.\n- Use more longitudinal and ethnographic methods to follow changes and observe routine practice.\n- Use mixed methods when helpful and report data clearly so we can better inform decisions."
