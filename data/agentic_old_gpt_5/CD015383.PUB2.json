    "output": "How effective and safe is therapy that uses psychedelics (a group of drugs that change perception, mood, and thinking) taken with therapist support for easing anxiety (feelings of fear, dread, and uneasiness), depression (ongoing sadness and low energy), and deep distress about life and death in people with life‑threatening diseases (illnesses that can lead to death, such as advanced cancer)?\n\nKey messages\n- Psychedelic‑assisted therapy (a treatment where a psychedelic drug is given in a supervised setting alongside structured talk therapy, with preparation before and integration after the drug session) using classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) may lower anxiety and may lower depression in people with life‑threatening disease, but the evidence is uncertain. No treatment‑related serious adverse events (severe harms linked to treatment, such as events requiring hospital care) were reported.\n- Short‑term side effects (unwanted events that do not cause lasting harm) were common. These included raised blood pressure (the force of blood on the artery walls), nausea (feeling sick), anxiety, temporary changes in perception or psychotic‑like symptoms (brief experiences like seeing or hearing things that the person recognises as drug effects), dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches. Most passed as the drug wore off or within about 1 week.\n- Evidence for MDMA (3,4‑methylenedioxymethamphetamine, often called Ecstasy, a psychoactive drug used in research to increase empathy and energy) is limited and uncertain. Effects on existential distress (deep suffering about meaning, purpose, or fear of death), quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), and spirituality (a person’s sense of peace, purpose, or connection) were mixed or unclear.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy helps reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‑threatening disease. We also wanted to know about side effects (adverse events; unwanted events) and effects on quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) and spirituality (a person’s sense of meaning or connection).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched databases and trial registers (public lists of clinical studies) for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments to fairly compare outcomes). We looked for trials that compared psychedelic‑assisted therapy with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment that looks like the real one but has no medicine) or a very low‑dose psychedelic (a small amount that causes mild effects). We combined results when appropriate and rated how certain the evidence is.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 randomized trials with 149 adults (data analysed for 140) who had life‑threatening diseases such as cancer. Participants were aged 36 to 64. Trials ran in outpatient clinics (patients who do not stay overnight) in the USA and Switzerland. Follow‑up lasted 6 to 12 months. Treatments included preparatory sessions (meetings before dosing to set expectations and review safety), a supervised drug session, and integration sessions (meetings after dosing to help apply the experience). Trials used psilocybin (a psychedelic found in some mushrooms) or LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide, a potent classical psychedelic) or MDMA. Trials compared these drugs with placebo or very low dose. No trial compared them with antidepressants (medicines used to treat depression).\n\nOverall, psilocybin or LSD may reduce anxiety and may reduce depression, but the certainty of evidence is low. It is unclear whether MDMA helps with anxiety or depression. Results for existential distress, quality of life, and spirituality were mixed or very uncertain. No treatment‑related serious adverse events were reported. Short‑lived minor to moderate side effects were common. Symptoms usually resolved as the drug wore off or within about 1 week.\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe judged the evidence to be low to very low certainty. The main reasons were small sample sizes (the number of participants was low), risk of bias (flaws in study design, such as people possibly knowing which treatment they received), and imprecision (wide uncertainty about the size of effects).\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- Small trials: sample sizes were low, so results are imprecise.\n- Blinding was hard: blinding (keeping participants and staff unaware of treatment) is difficult because psychedelic effects are noticeable. Unblinding (when people learn which treatment they had) can change how people report outcomes.\n- Not all outcomes were measured in every trial: for example, some trials did not record spirituality or existential distress.\n- Settings and funding: trials were done in limited settings and were funded by organisations that support psychedelic research, which may affect generalisability.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy with psilocybin or LSD may help some people with serious illness feel less anxious or depressed. We have only limited confidence in these findings. Short‑term side effects are common but usually pass within days. Clinicians should weigh potential benefits against the uncertain evidence and the known short‑term side effects.\n\nWhat further research is needed?\nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that keep participants and outcome assessors unaware of treatment (blinding), use active placebo (a comparison that mimics some drug effects), follow people for longer to assess lasting benefits and harms, and report adverse events (side effects) in detail. Research in more varied settings is also needed.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
