    "output": "Do mental health and social support programs improve well-being for people in poorer countries affected by war, conflict, or disasters?\n\nKey messages\n- Overall, group programs that aim to improve mental health and social support (psychosocial interventions: non-drug group activities that address mental, emotional, social, and spiritual needs, such as coping skills training, psychoeducation, and peer support) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs: countries with lower average incomes and fewer resources for services) affected by humanitarian crises (serious events like war, conflict, or disasters that threaten lives and basic needs) showed little clear benefit for children and adolescents and may give a small short-term gain in adults’ mental well-being (a positive state in which a person feels good, copes with stress, and functions well). Longer-term effects (months after the program) are uncertain. Effects on everyday functioning (ability to do daily tasks at home, school, or work) and helping behaviours (prosocial behaviour: actions that help or benefit others, such as sharing or cooperating) were unclear.\n- We found 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies that assign people by chance to different groups) with 7,917 participants. Most programs were group based and delivered by paraprofessionals (trained helpers who are not licensed mental health specialists). The trials were few, small, short, and varied a lot, so we are not confident in the results (certainty of evidence: how sure we are that study results reflect the true effect).\n- We need larger, better trials with longer follow-up, consistent outcome measures, clear reporting of harms and costs, and detail on who benefits and why. Trials should report acceptability (how suitable or satisfactory an intervention is, often judged by how many people drop out).\n\nWhat mental health challenges do people face in humanitarian settings (places affected by crises where people get emergency help)?\nWe live in a world where millions leave home because of war, violence, persecution, or disasters. Many of these people live in LMICs. Crises cause loss, violence, displacement, separation from family, and long uncertainty about safety, shelter, and income. Schools and health services may stop. These pressures can harm mental health (a person’s overall psychological and emotional condition). Mental health includes feeling well, working in daily life, keeping relationships, and having purpose.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how might they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are non-drug programs that aim to improve thoughts, feelings, and relationships. They include group psychoeducation, stress management, problem-solving, school or community programs, and parenting support. Programs often use task-sharing, where paraprofessionals deliver care under supervision to reach more people when specialists are scarce. Programs aim to boost mental well-being, functioning, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), resilience (ability to bounce back after hardship), coping (thoughts and actions people use to manage stress), hope (a future-focused belief that things can improve), and prosocial behaviour.\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether group psychosocial programs in LMIC humanitarian settings help the wider community, not people chosen because they have a diagnosed mental disorder (diagnosis: identifying a condition from signs and symptoms). We focused on RCTs. We planned to measure mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, prosocial behaviour, and acceptability.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched multiple databases and trial registries using Cochrane methods (established guidelines for finding and summarizing research). We included RCTs that compared group psychosocial programs with no program, usual care (the standard care people would normally get), or a waiting list (a group told they will get the program later). We summarized results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 RCTs with 7,917 people in settings affected by war, displacement, or other crises. Nine trials involved children and adolescents and 4 involved adults. Trials ran about 10 to 32 weeks (average 18 weeks). All programs were group based and mostly led by paraprofessionals.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\n- Adults: Programs may slightly improve mental well-being at the end of the program. The evidence is low certainty. We do not know if any gains last.\n- Children and adolescents: Programs showed little clear benefit for mental well-being at the end of the program. Effects on functioning and prosocial behaviour were unclear or showed little to no change. One trial suggested better functioning, but that finding is very uncertain.\nStudies varied widely in people, programs, and measures. This heterogeneity (how much study results differ) and small study sizes lowered our confidence.\n\nWhat are the main gaps and what should happen next?\n- We need larger, well-designed RCTs with longer follow-up and consistent ways to measure outcomes that matter to communities.\n- Trials should report functioning, prosocial behaviour, quality of life, acceptability, harms, and costs. They should describe program content and delivery so effective approaches can be copied and scaled.\n\nLimitations\nMany trials were small and short. People could know which group they were in, which can create bias (risk of bias: chance that study problems change the results). Not all outcomes were measured or reported. These issues reduce our confidence.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
