    "output": "Are regular timed doses (automatic boluses) better than a steady continuous drip (basal infusion) for epidural pain relief (having to do with the space between the wall of the spinal canal and the covering of the spinal cord; an epidural injection is given into this space) during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that regular timed doses (automated mandatory bolus, AMB: a programmed epidural pump that gives set doses of pain medicine at regular time intervals rather than a steady continuous drip) probably reduce episodes of breakthrough pain (a sudden, short-lived increase in pain that breaks through ongoing pain relief) that need an anaesthesiologist (a doctor who gives anaesthesia and manages pain) to step in. AMB also probably reduces how much local anaesthetic (a medicine that numbs nerves in a specific area to block pain) is used, compared with a steady continuous drip (basal infusion, BI: a continuous, slow infusion of epidural pain medicine delivered steadily over time).\n- AMB probably makes little or no difference to caesarean delivery (a surgical birth through incisions in the abdomen and uterus), instrumental delivery (a vaginal birth assisted with tools such as forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery), the time that pain relief lasts, or the baby’s condition at birth (Apgar score: a quick check of a newborn’s breathing, heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes, and colour). AMB may increase mothers’ satisfaction with pain relief.\n\nWhat question did we ask?\n- We asked whether AMB is better than BI for keeping epidural pain relief working during term labour (pregnancy at 37–42 weeks).\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people are randomly assigned by chance to different treatments to reduce bias) that compared AMB with BI to maintain epidural pain relief. \n- We pooled results for key outcomes: breakthrough pain, mode of birth, duration of pain relief, amount of anaesthetic used, mothers’ satisfaction, and Apgar scores. \n- We rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (a system for rating how certain we are about research evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 18 trials with 4,590 women in labour at term. Most trials involved first-time mothers (nulliparous: a woman who has never given birth). Trials excluded preterm or complicated pregnancies and multiple pregnancies.\n- Some trials started epidurals with a combined spinal–epidural (CSE: a small dose into the spinal fluid for quick relief plus an epidural catheter for ongoing dosing) or with a dural puncture epidural (DPE: a small, intentional puncture of the membrane around the spinal cord to help the epidural spread without injecting medicine into the spinal fluid). Some regimens also allowed patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA: a system that lets the laboring patient press a button to receive an extra safe dose).\n- Compared with BI, AMB probably reduced episodes of breakthrough pain that needed the anaesthesiologist to intervene. AMB probably reduced the total amount of local anaesthetic used (reported as bupivacaine equivalents: a way to compare doses of different numbing drugs). AMB probably made little or no difference to caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery), duration of pain relief, or Apgar scores. AMB may have increased maternal satisfaction in some studies.\n\nHow sure are we?\n- We are moderately confident in these findings. Some trials might have allowed people to know which treatment they got (no blinding: keeping people unaware of the treatment to avoid biased results). Not all trials reported every outcome. Trials used different drugs and different ways of starting the epidural. Some important unwanted effects were not reported consistently.\n\nWhat does this mean for women and clinicians?\n- For healthy women in uncomplicated term pregnancies, often first-time mothers, AMB may lower sudden episodes of pain that need extra help and may reduce how much numbing medicine is used. \n- AMB likely does not change the chance of surgical birth or a birth assisted by forceps or vacuum. It probably does not change the baby’s condition at birth (Apgar score).\n- Clinicians should note that trials used different epidural starts (epidural only, CSE, or DPE) and sometimes included PCEA. Results were similar across approaches, but drug use varied in some groups.\n- We need more large, well-designed trials to confirm effects on birth mode, to measure adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment) consistently, to compare different epidural starts, and to study mothers’ satisfaction and resource use (how much medicine and staff time is needed).\n\nLimitations\n- The evidence comes from trials that were generally well done but not definitive. People may have been aware of which treatment they received. Some outcomes were not reported. Event numbers were small for some outcomes.\n\nCurrency\n- This review updates our previous review and includes evidence up to December 2022."
