    "output": "Title\nWhich feeding method after Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy — a major operation that removes the head of the pancreas and nearby parts of the digestive system) helps adults recover best: eating by mouth, a feeding tube into the gut, or IV (intravenous) nutrition?\n\nKey messages\n- After Whipple surgery, feeding through a jejunostomy (surgery to make an opening into the jejunum, a part of the small intestine, so a feeding tube can be placed) may shorten hospital stay by about 1–2 days compared with total parenteral nutrition (TPN — nutrition given directly into the bloodstream through a vein that bypasses the digestive system). We saw no clear differences in pancreatic fistula (a leak of pancreatic fluid from the surgical site), delayed gastric emptying (the stomach empties slowly after surgery), bleeding after surgery (postpancreatectomy hemorrhage), or death.\n- Feeding through a nasojejunal tube (a thin tube passed through the nose into the jejunum to deliver liquid nutrition) and parenteral nutrition (IV/TPN — nutrition into a vein) gave similar overall recovery. Nasojejunal feeding may slightly raise the chance of an important pancreatic fistula.\n- The evidence is limited and mixed. We need larger, well-designed trials that directly compare oral feeding, enteral feeding (tube feeding into the gut), and parenteral/IV nutrition and that report outcomes patients care about.\n\nWhat is a Whipple operation and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA Whipple operation (pancreaticoduodenectomy) changes how the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine are joined. This can make it hard to digest food and absorb nutrients. Many people risk malnutrition (not getting enough calories or key nutrients) after this surgery.\n\nWhat feeding options are used after this surgery?\n- Oral feeding: eating and drinking by mouth.\n- Enteral feeding: giving liquid nutrition into the gut (by tube). This includes nasojejunal tubes and jejunostomy tubes (a tube placed into the small intestine through the abdominal wall at surgery).\n- Parenteral nutrition (including TPN): giving nutrition into a vein (intravenous, IV — into the bloodstream), which bypasses the gut.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know which postoperative feeding approach works best for adults after Whipple surgery. We compared routes and timing of feeding (by mouth, by tube into the gut, or by IV). We looked at outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding after surgery, deaths, and time to return to a normal diet.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched databases to October 2022 for randomized trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to different treatments to reduce bias). We combined results when possible using meta-analysis (a method that pools results from several studies). We rated how confident we are in the evidence using GRADE (a system that rates certainty as high, moderate, low, or very low).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 randomized trials with 1,897 adults after pancreaticoduodenectomy. We combined 8 trials in meta-analyses. At least 13 trials used enteral feeding, at least 10 used parenteral nutrition, and 7 used oral feeding protocols.\n\nMain results\n- Jejunostomy feeding versus TPN: Jejunostomy feeding probably shortens hospital stay by about 1–2 days (moderate-certainty evidence). We think it makes little or no difference in pancreatic fistula rates. We are uncertain about effects on delayed gastric emptying or bleeding after surgery (low to very low certainty). (Mean difference is the average difference in days between groups.)\n- Nasojejunal feeding versus TPN: Little or no difference in hospital stay, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding. Nasojejunal feeding may slightly increase clinically important pancreatic fistula (low-certainty evidence).\n- Jejunostomy feeding versus oral feeding: Little or no difference, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Death rates: We found no clear differences in deaths across comparisons. Most outcomes had low or very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\nTrials varied in who took part, when feeding started, how much nutrition was given, and surgical techniques. Not all trials reported the same outcomes. Some trials were not blinded. These issues lower our confidence in the results.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nJejunostomy feeding after a Whipple operation may help people leave hospital a little sooner than IV/TPN, with similar short-term complication rates. We cannot be sure which method is best for everyone. We need larger trials that directly compare the main feeding options and measure outcomes that matter to patients.\n\nCurrency\nWe searched the evidence to October 2022."
