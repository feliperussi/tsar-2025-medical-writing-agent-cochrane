    "output": "Do education support services (extra help with schoolwork) help children and teenagers with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and do better at school?\n\nKey messages\n- We found only 4 small randomized controlled studies (studies where participants are randomly assigned to an intervention or comparison group to test whether the intervention works). Because of this, we cannot be sure whether education support services help children and teenagers with a chronic health condition (constant health problem that affects health for a long time) to stay engaged with school (school engagement: how much a student attends, participates, and feels connected to school) or to improve academic achievement (academic achievement: results showing what a student has learned, often measured by grades or test scores). Results for school engagement were mixed and suggested possible benefit. Results for academic achievement did not agree. No studies reported unwanted or harmful effects (adverse effects: unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment).\n- Some small studies suggested a slight improvement in mental health (a personâ€™s overall psychological and emotional condition), measured as self-esteem (how much a person values and feels confident about themselves). One small study suggested help with transition back to school (school re-entry: the process of returning to school after time away due to illness). Most research was in children with cancer (a disease where abnormal cells grow and can spread). One study involved children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: a condition that affects attention, self-control, and activity level).\n- We need more and better research. We need larger, well-planned studies that include more types of long-term illnesses, measure outcomes that matter to families and schools (school engagement, academic achievement, returning to school, quality of life: how someone feels and functions day to day), follow students for longer, and report any adverse effects and costs. This would let us be more certain about benefits and harms.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children, and why can they affect school?\nSome children and adolescents live with long-lasting illnesses that usually do not spread to other people. These are chronic health conditions (constant health problems that affect health for a long time). Many of these young people can still go to school. A smaller group have serious symptoms that limit daily activities. This can make regular attendance hard. Going to school matters for learning, friendships, and well-being (how someone feels and functions day to day). When illness causes missed school, young people can take part less in school life. Lower school engagement (how much a student attends, participates, and feels connected to school) links with lower grades, worse social and emotional health, and fewer future opportunities.\n\nWhat are education support services, and how might they help?\nEducation support services are extra help to keep students learning and connected when illness interrupts school. An intervention (a treatment, procedure, or other action) can include help with classwork, coordination between healthcare teams and schools, or ways to stay in touch with teachers and classmates. The aim is to stop students from falling behind and to keep school engagement so academic achievement (results showing what a student has learned) does not fall.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to describe the types of education support offered to young people with chronic health conditions. We also wanted to know whether these supports improve school engagement (how much a student attends, participates, and feels connected to school) and academic achievement (grades and test scores).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched health, education, and social science databases (information collected and organized for research) and trial registers (public databases where planned and ongoing studies are listed). Two reviewers screened studies and extracted data. We focused on studies of 4 to 18 year olds that reported school engagement or academic achievement. We summarized the evidence (findings from the studies) and rated how certain we are about the results using risk of bias (flaws in the way a study is designed, done, or analyzed that favor one conclusion) and GRADE (a system used to rate how certain we are about research findings).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 4 randomized controlled studies with 359 children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years. Three studies focused on children with cancer and one on children with ADHD. Studies reported school engagement (4 studies), academic achievement (3 studies), transition back to school (1 study), and mental health measured as self-esteem (2 studies). No studies reported quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) or adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was very limited and mostly low or very low certainty. The studies had important risks of bias. We are uncertain whether education support improves school engagement or academic achievement. One small study suggested a possible small benefit for transition back to school, but this is very uncertain. Two studies suggested a small improvement in self-esteem.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. People in the studies may have known which treatment they received. Not all studies gave data on all the outcomes we wanted. The studies used different people and different ways to deliver the intervention. The evidence does not cover all the people and conditions we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2021."
