    "output": "Title: Is the inverted internal limiting membrane flap (a small flap from the eye’s inner retinal layer) better than standard membrane peeling for surgery to repair large macular holes (holes in the center of the retina)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with large macular holes (a full-thickness gap in the macula, the small central part of the retina that gives sharp central vision), surgery using an inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap (a small piece of the retina’s very thin inner lining left attached and folded over the hole like a patch) probably increases the chance the hole will close and may improve vision after a few months, compared with standard ILM peeling (carefully removing that thin lining).  \n- The benefit was clearest for hole closure, including type 1 closure (complete closure with the central retinal layers rejoined on imaging). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (a scan that gives detailed 3-D pictures of the eye) showed this change more clearly than early vision tests. Vision differences were not clear in the first few weeks. The studies were small, often done at one hospital (single-center trial), and followed people for only a short time, so we must be cautious.  \n- What should happen next: We need larger, well-designed studies in multiple hospitals (multicenter trials) that follow people longer, use standard vision tests such as logMAR charts (a standardized chart; lower logMAR numbers mean better vision), and report unwanted effects, quality of life, and costs.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?  \nThe macula (the small central area of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye) gives sharp central vision for tasks like reading. A macular hole (a full-thickness gap through the macula) causes blurred or missing central vision. Large macular holes (often wider than 400 micrometres, µm; 1 µm = 0.001 mm) are harder to close and affect daily life more. Holes can be idiopathic (of unknown cause), traumatic (caused by injury), or myopic (linked to severe short-sightedness).\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated?  \nSurgeons commonly perform pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (an operation where tiny instruments enter the eye through a safe part of the white eye to remove the vitreous, the eye’s clear gel, so the surgeon can work on the retina). Surgeons often place a temporary gas bubble to help the hole close. During PPV, surgeons may remove the internal limiting membrane (ILM) (an ultra-thin inner lining of the retina) around the hole (ILM peeling). An alternative is the inverted ILM flap technique, where a small ILM piece is left attached and flipped over the hole to act as a scaffold for tissue to grow and close the gap.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether PPV using the inverted ILM flap works better and is as safe as conventional ILM peeling for large macular holes. We looked at vision after surgery (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA, your sharpest vision with the best glasses or contacts), hole closure on imaging (an anatomical outcome), and unwanted effects (harms).\n\nMethods\nWe searched databases and trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments to reduce bias). We combined results for vision, hole closure, and safety. We judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 4 randomized studies with 275 people (285 eyes) who had large idiopathic full-thickness macular holes (minimum linear diameter >400 µm). Participants were mostly older adults and about 2/3 were women. Studies took place in India, Poland, and Mexico. Three studies were single-center; 1 was multicenter. Some people had cataract surgery (removal of a cloudy lens) at the same time as PPV. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months.\n\nOverall, the inverted ILM flap probably increases the chance the hole will close, including type 1 closure seen on OCT. The flap may give slightly better vision at 3 months or more (functional outcome), but we are uncertain about early vision differences. Few harms were reported, so we cannot tell whether one technique is safer.\n\nLimitations\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. Studies were small and often single-center. Some studies were unmasked (participants or staff may have known the treatment). Not all outcomes were reported. Some people had cataract surgery at the same time, which can affect vision results. These issues can introduce bias (flaws that favour one result). The evidence covers large idiopathic holes only and not all causes or patient groups.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is current to December 2022."
