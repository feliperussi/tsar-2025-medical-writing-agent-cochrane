    "output": "Title\nDoes placing a drain (a tube used to remove fluid from the body) after appendix surgery for severe or burst appendicitis (complicated appendicitis: when the appendix has dead tissue, has burst, or caused pus or widespread infection) prevent pus pockets inside the belly (intraperitoneal abscesses: pockets of pus within the abdominal cavity)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found insufficient reliable evidence that routinely placing a drain after appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix, a small, fingerlike pouch on the large intestine) for complicated appendicitis reduces intraperitoneal abscesses. All people in the studies also received antibiotics (drugs that kill bacteria).\n- Drains did not clearly lower abscesses or wound infection (infection of the surgical cut). Drains may cause harms such as longer length of hospital stay (number of days in hospital) and a higher risk of death within 30 days (mortality: number of deaths in a group over time), especially after open appendectomy (removal through a single larger cut). We are uncertain about these harms because the evidence is low quality.\n- No trials compared drain types (open drains that let fluid drain onto a dressing versus closed drains that attach to a sealed bag) or compared early versus late drain removal (planned timing for taking out a drain). We need larger, well-designed trials that measure outcomes patients care about.\n\nIntroduction and aims\nWhat is appendicitis and how is it treated?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix (a small, fingerlike pouch that sticks out from the first part of the large intestine). The usual treatment is appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix). Surgeons do open appendectomy (one larger cut in the lower belly) or laparoscopic appendectomy (keyhole surgery using a camera and small instruments through several small cuts). People usually get antibiotics to treat or prevent infection.\n\nWhat makes appendicitis ‘complicated’, and why is that a problem?\nComplicated appendicitis means the appendix is badly damaged, for example gangrenous (part of the tissue has died) or perforated (burst). A burst appendix can spread infection inside the abdomen and cause peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen). After surgery for complicated appendicitis, people face higher risks of intraperitoneal abscess (a pocket of pus inside the abdomen), wound infection, longer hospital stay, and rarely death.\n\nWhat are abdominal drains, and why might surgeons use them?\nA drain is a tube or device placed in the abdomen to remove blood or fluid after surgery. Surgeons hope drains stop fluid from collecting and lower the chance of an abscess. Open drains let fluid pass onto a dressing. Closed drains connect to a sealed bag or bottle to collect fluid.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether leaving a drain after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis reduces intraperitoneal abscesses in children and adults. We also wanted to compare open versus closed drains and early versus late drain removal. We looked at wound infection, overall complications (morbidity: health problems after treatment), death (mortality), and length of hospital stay.\n\nMethods\nWe searched multiple databases and trial registers up to 12 October 2023 for studies in children and adults with complicated appendicitis. We included studies that compared a drain versus no drain after open or laparoscopic appendectomy, different drain types, or different timing for removing a drain. All included people received antibiotics. We combined results when possible and judged study quality and our confidence using Cochrane methods and GRADE (a system for rating how certain we are about evidence).\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies (5 randomised controlled trials, meaning people were assigned to treatment by chance, and 3 quasi-randomised trials, meaning assignment used non-random methods like date of birth). The studies included 739 people with complicated appendicitis. Of these, 370 had a drain and 369 did not. Studies came from North America, Asia, and Africa and were published between 1973 and 2023. Most outcomes were measured within 30 days.\n\nMain results\n- Death within 30 days: Using a drain after open appendectomy probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. This result mainly applies to open surgery.\n- Abscesses and wound infection: We are very uncertain whether drains reduce intraperitoneal abscesses or wound infections because the studies were small and low quality.\n- Overall complications and hospital stay: We are very uncertain whether drains change overall complications (morbidity) or length of hospital stay.\n- Drain types and timing: No trials compared open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal, so we cannot say which approach is best.\n\nLimitations\nAll included studies were at high risk of bias (flaws in study design or conduct that can lead to incorrect conclusions). Studies were small, done in different settings, and may not have blinded participants or researchers. Not all studies reported every outcome. These limits reduce our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat this means for patients and doctors\nWe cannot recommend routine drains after surgery for complicated appendicitis in people who receive antibiotics. The evidence is uncertain about benefit and suggests possible harm after open surgery. Doctors should weigh this uncertainty and discuss options with patients.\n\nImplications for research\nWe need larger, well-designed randomised trials that compare no drain with drains, compare drain types (open versus closed), and test timing for drain removal. Trials should include children and adults, report outcomes that matter to patients (abscess, wound infection, death, pain, length of hospital stay), and follow people long enough to detect later problems.\n\nCurrency of evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to searches done to 12 October 2023."
