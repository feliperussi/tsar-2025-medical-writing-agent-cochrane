    "output": "Do mucus-thinning medicines (mucolytics: medicines that thin and loosen thick mucus in the airways so it’s easier to cough out and clear the lungs) reduce flare-ups and improve breathing in children with long-term wet cough lung conditions (chronic suppurative lung disease, CSLD: long-lasting airway infections that produce pus and a persistent wet cough, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found only 1 small study, so we do not know if mucolytics reduce flare-ups (exacerbations: sudden worsening of symptoms) or improve lung function (lung function: how well the lungs work to take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide). The study tested inhaled hypertonic saline (hypertonic saline: a saltier-than-normal salty water solution breathed in as a mist) used with chest physiotherapy (chest physiotherapy: techniques to help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs). The study had design problems (bias: flaws in study design or conduct that can distort results), so the results are uncertain.\n- The evidence applies only to nebulised hypertonic saline (nebulised: delivered as a fine mist using a machine called a nebuliser so the medicine can be inhaled directly into the lungs) given in hospital outpatient settings (outpatient setting: care during clinic visits without staying overnight). We found no trials that started mucolytics during flare-ups, no trials in protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB: a long-lasting wet cough caused by persistent bacterial infection), and no trials of oral mucolytics (oral: by mouth) in children, apart from studies that are still ongoing.\n- Future research should include larger, well-designed randomized trials (randomized controlled trial: a study where participants are placed randomly into treatment groups). Trials should follow children longer, compare inhaled and oral mucolytics, test use during flare-ups and stable periods, and report outcomes that matter to families, such as quality of life (quality of life: how someone feels and functions day to day) and unwanted effects (adverse events: unwanted events that cause harm).\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children?\nCSLD is a long-term condition in which the airways (airways: breathing tubes that carry air from the nose and mouth to the lungs) are repeatedly infected and inflamed (inflammation: the body’s response that can include swelling and redness). Children have a chronic wet or productive cough (productive cough: a ‘wet’ cough that may bring up mucus). CSLD includes bronchiectasis (bronchiectasis: permanent widening and damage to the airways that causes mucus build-up and repeated infections) and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). PBB often improves with the right antibiotics.\n\nHow is CSLD usually treated, and what are mucolytic medicines?\nWe usually use airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy to help move mucus out of the lungs. Doctors also use antibiotics for infections. Mucolytics aim to thin or loosen thick, sticky mucus so children can cough it out more easily. Thinner mucus may help the lungs’ self-cleaning system (mucociliary clearance: tiny hairs move mucus upward to remove germs and debris). Mucolytics can be inhaled, such as hypertonic saline, or taken by mouth (oral).\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe asked whether mucolytics, compared with no mucolytic or a placebo (placebo: a ‘dummy’ treatment with no active medicine), reduce flare-ups, improve lung function, speed recovery during flare-ups, improve quality of life, or cause harms.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases and journals for trials in children up to 18 years with CSLD not caused by cystic fibrosis (cystic fibrosis: an inherited disease that causes very thick mucus). We included trials that compared a mucolytic with no mucolytic or placebo. We summarized flare-ups, lung function, recovery, quality of life, and harms. We judged how much we could trust the evidence using standard methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 1 small randomized cross-over trial (cross-over study: each participant receives both the treatment and the control at different times) in children with bronchiectasis. Sixty-three children entered the study. Results from the first treatment period were reported for 52 children (26 per group). The trial compared nebulised 3% hypertonic saline before chest physiotherapy with chest physiotherapy alone for 8 weeks. The average age was about 9–10 years. The study did not measure quality of life. The authors reported no dropouts due to side effects (dropouts: participants who leave a trial early). Two other trials are ongoing, including one of the oral mucolytic erdosteine (erdosteine: an oral mucolytic medicine being studied).\n\nBecause the evidence comes from a single small trial at high risk of bias, we are uncertain whether regular nebulised hypertonic saline between flare-ups reduces flare-ups or improves lung function. We found no usable information on quality of life or harms. No studies tested starting mucolytics during flare-ups or tested other mucolytic medicines in children with CSLD outside bronchiectasis.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe have low confidence. The single small trial may have allowed people to know which treatment they received (lack of blinding causes bias). The trial reported only a few outcomes. These limits reduce our certainty.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nResearchers should run larger, well-designed randomized trials in children with bronchiectasis and PBB. Trials should test inhaled and oral mucolytics, start treatments during flare-ups and stable periods, follow children for longer, and report quality of life and harms.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2024."
