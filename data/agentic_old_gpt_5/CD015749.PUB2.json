    "output": "Title: Do combined treatments (medicine, diet, and exercise) help manage disease-related weight and muscle loss (cachexia)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found too little reliable evidence to say that combined treatments (multimodal interventions: a treatment plan that combines 2 or more types of therapy, such as medicines, nutrition, and exercise) work better than usual care (the standard care a patient would normally get) or a single approach (one type of therapy). Unwanted effects (adverse events: an unwanted event that causes harm) were reported in some studies but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- We saw no clear benefits for physical function (how well someone can do everyday activities like walking or climbing stairs), strength (the force muscles can produce), body weight, body composition (the amounts of muscle and fat), quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), appetite (desire to eat), fatigue (extreme tiredness), or biochemical markers (measurable substances in blood that show disease or response to treatment). Most studies were small, short, and done in people with cancer (diseases where abnormal cells grow out of control), so results may not apply to all long-term (chronic) illnesses.\n- We need larger, well-designed randomized trials (studies that assign people by chance to different groups) in different long-term illnesses, with longer treatment and follow-up. Future studies should define cachexia clearly, measure outcomes that matter to patients, and report unwanted effects fully.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem?\nCachexia is severe, unintentional loss of body weight and muscle (a condition marked by loss of more than 10% of body weight and muscle in someone not trying to lose weight). It occurs with many long-term diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS (a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus), chronic kidney disease (when the kidneys slowly lose function), and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a long-term lung disease that makes breathing hard). Cachexia changes how the body uses energy. This makes it hard to keep or build muscle even when people eat more. People with cachexia often feel very tired, lose appetite, and find daily activities harder. Cachexia can lower quality of life and make it harder to cope with illness and treatment.\n\nWhat are multimodal treatments for cachexia?\nNo single treatment reliably reverses cachexia. Care may include nutrition (the taking in and use of food by the body), exercise therapy (planned physical activity to improve strength and function), and medicines that may boost appetite or help build muscle. A multimodal intervention combines 2 or more of these at the same time. The aim is to keep or improve muscle and weight, increase strength and physical ability, reduce tiredness, improve appetite, and improve quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether combined programs for cachexia help more than usual care, a single treatment, or another version of a combined program. We looked at day-to-day physical ability, muscle strength, body weight and muscle mass, quality of life, appetite, tiredness, biochemical markers (measurable substances in blood), and unwanted effects (harms).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched databases and trial registers up to July 2024 for randomized trials in adults with or at risk of cachexia. We included studies that tested combined nutrition/exercise/medicine programs against usual care, a single treatment, or another combined program. We summarized results for function, strength, weight, symptoms, and harms. We rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 randomized trials with 926 adults (average age 63). Most studies were in Europe and involved people with cancer. One study each included people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. Treatments lasted from 6 weeks to about 3 to 7 months. Outcomes were measured at the end of treatment. Across studies, we found no clear differences between combined care and comparison treatments for physical function, strength, body weight, body composition, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, biochemical markers, or harms. Most results came from small, short studies with design limits. The evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say whether multimodal interventions help, harm, or make no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nPeople in the studies may have known which treatment they got. Not all studies reported all outcomes we wanted. Studies were small and few. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or illnesses.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nWe need larger, well-designed randomized trials in different long-term illnesses, with longer treatment and follow-up. Future studies should define cachexia clearly, measure outcomes that matter to patients (daily function and well-being), and report unwanted effects fully.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
