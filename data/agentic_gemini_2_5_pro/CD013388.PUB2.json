    "output": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- Cognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. The review found no unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\n\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage daily tasks and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In this therapy, a person with dementia and a therapist work together. They set goals for specific daily tasks they find difficult and find new strategies to manage them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their care partners.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 6 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The average age of people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years, and between 29.4% and 79.3% were men. In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Researchers checked on people 3 to 12 months after their treatment ended to see if the benefits lasted.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\n\nWe found that cognitive rehabilitation greatly helps people with mild to moderate dementia with the daily tasks they choose to work on. People saw these improvements at the end of the treatment, and the benefits continued for several months. The treatment also slightly increases a person's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also slightly improves their ability to focus on sounds for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves their social life. It also probably improves their mood and mental health for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general ability to handle daily tasks immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is mainly because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and there were not enough studies to be certain about all the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
