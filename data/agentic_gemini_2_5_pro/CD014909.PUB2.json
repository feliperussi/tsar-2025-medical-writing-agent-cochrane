    "output": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, using a bowel cleanse (laxatives) with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of complications like wound infections and bowel leakage, compared to using a bowel cleanse alone.\n- We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this surgery has a higher risk of problems than other abdominal operations. The most serious problems are infections where you had surgery (surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined your bowel (anastomotic leakage). To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in two main ways. They can use laxatives to physically empty the bowel; this is called a 'bowel cleanse' (mechanical bowel preparation). They can also give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: a bowel cleanse alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included a total of 5264 adults. These adults were having planned colorectal surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined bowel preparation (a bowel cleanse plus oral antibiotics) against three other approaches. These were: a bowel cleanse alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on side effects. Only 4 studies reported on them. None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in body salts (electrolyte imbalances).\n\nWhat did the review find?\nCompared to using only a bowel cleanse, using both a bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics probably reduces wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel.\nThis combined approach probably makes little to no difference in the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference in the bowel taking time to start working again after surgery.\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because we had concerns about how some studies were conducted. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of giving the treatments. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021."
