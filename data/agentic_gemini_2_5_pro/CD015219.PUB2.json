    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of the antiviral medicine favipiravir for people with COVID-19?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, it is uncertain whether the antiviral medicine favipiravir helps people with COVID-19 get better. It may, however, cause more unwanted effects than treatment with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or standard care.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if favipiravir is a useful treatment for people with COVID-19.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why was favipiravir considered as a treatment?\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been a major challenge for health systems around the world. In the search for effective treatments, researchers investigated several existing medicines. One of these was favipiravir, an antiviral drug that some experts believed could be a safe and effective treatment for people with COVID-19. However, its actual benefit remained uncertain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of favipiravir for treating people with COVID-19. We compared it against no treatment, standard supportive care, or other experimental antiviral medicines.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). In these studies, the antiviral drug favipiravir was compared with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral drugs for people with COVID-19. We compared and summarized the results of the studies we found. We also assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 25 trials involving 5750 adults, most of whom were under 60 years of age. The majority of participants (89%) were hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19. The studies took place in various countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment with favipiravir ranged from 5 to 14 days. Most trials compared favipiravir to a placebo or standard care.\n\nHowever, treatment with favipiravir may lead to more unwanted effects compared to placebo or standard care. We are uncertain if favipiravir affects:\n- the number of people who die\n- the number of people who need a machine to help them breathe\n- the time it takes for symptoms to get better\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Some studies were small, and the way participants were chosen could have affected the results. Some studies also relied on data that participants reported themselves, which can be less accurate.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023."
