    "output": "Can estrogen therapy help postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse (when organs in the pelvis, such as the womb or bladder, slip down)?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not know if oestrogen therapy (a hormone treatment) on its own helps to treat pelvic organ prolapse because we did not find enough evidence.\n- There is some limited evidence that using oestrogen cream or gel with other treatments might be helpful. It may reduce vaginal problems in women using a vaginal pessary (a device inserted to provide support) and may reduce urinary tract infections (infections of the bladder or kidneys) after surgery for prolapse.\n- We need larger and better-quality studies to understand the long-term benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is when organs in the pelvis, such as the womb (uterus), bladder, or rectum, slip down and bulge into the vagina. It is a common condition for women after menopause, especially those who have given birth. Oestrogen is a hormone that decreases after menopause. Some believe that oestrogen therapy might help with POP symptoms. It could be used on its own or with other treatments, like surgery or a vaginal pessary (a device inserted into the vagina to provide support).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if oestrogen therapy helps improve POP symptoms in women after menopause. We also wanted to know if the therapy has any unwanted or harmful effects. We looked at oestrogen given in different ways, such as creams applied to the vagina (local) or pills taken by mouth (systemic).\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared oestrogen therapy (alone or with other treatments) to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or other options for postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. All the studies looked at oestrogen therapy combined with other treatments.\n- 3 studies compared oestrogen therapy plus a vaginal pessary with a vaginal pessary alone.\n- 11 studies compared oestrogen therapy plus surgery with surgery alone.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at oestrogen therapy on its own. Because of this, we do not know if oestrogen therapy by itself improves POP symptoms.\nWhen used with other treatments, oestrogen applied to the vagina may lead to fewer vaginal problems for women using a pessary. It may also reduce urinary tract infections after surgery. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Not all studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different types of oestrogen therapy and were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2022."
