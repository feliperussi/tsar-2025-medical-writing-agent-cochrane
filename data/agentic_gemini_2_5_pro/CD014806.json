    "output": "Can giving sugar water to newborn babies reduce pain from heel prick tests?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving newborn babies a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably helps to reduce their pain during heel prick tests (a procedure where a small blood sample is taken from the baby's heel) compared to giving plain water or no treatment. The studies found only minor side effects that did not need any treatment.\n- Giving sugar water seems to be about as effective at relieving pain as giving glucose (another type of sugar), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin contact with a parent.\n- Because there was not enough good-quality evidence, it is unclear how effective sugar water is compared to other comforting methods like breastfeeding or non-nutritive sucking (giving a baby a pacifier to suck on). More research is needed to find out if combining sugar water with other ways to relieve pain is more effective.\n\nWhy is pain relief important for newborn babies?\nNewborn babies (sometimes called neonates) sometimes need to have minor but painful medical procedures, such as a 'heel lance'. This is where a small cut is made on the baby's heel to get a blood sample for testing. Because these procedures can cause pain and distress, researchers are looking for simple and safe ways to comfort them and relieve their pain. One method that has been studied is giving babies a small amount of sucrose (a type of sugar) by mouth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving sucrose helps to relieve pain for newborn babies who have a heel lance. We also wanted to know how sucrose compared with other ways to relieve pain, such as giving water, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, or non-nutritive sucking (giving a pacifier).\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving sucrose with other treatments or no treatment for relieving pain in newborn babies having a heel lance. In these studies, researchers measured pain using scoring systems that look at things like crying and facial expressions. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 55 studies with a total of 6273 newborn babies. Some studies included full-term babies (born at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy), some included preterm babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and some included a mix of both. The studies looked at how well giving sugar water relieved pain during heel prick tests. They compared giving sugar water with other options, such as giving plain water, no treatment, other comforting methods (like giving a pacifier, breastfeeding, or skin-to-skin care), or other ways to relieve pain.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nGiving a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably reduces pain for newborn babies having a heel prick test, compared to giving plain water or no treatment.\n\nSugar water may make little to no difference in pain when compared to giving glucose (another type of sugar), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin care.\n\nWe are uncertain if sugar water is more or less effective than other comfort measures. These include non-nutritive sucking (using a pacifier), breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking (holding the baby in a curled position). We also do not know if combining sugar water with a pacifier is more effective than using a pacifier alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for some comparisons. This is because the studies included different types of babies (full-term and preterm) and used different ways to measure pain. Also, for many of the comforting methods we looked at, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up-to-date to February 2022."
