    "output": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection also probably lowers the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation. It also reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation. The review found few reported unwanted effects from this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them consistently to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nDiabetes can cause a serious eye condition called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This condition causes new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). These blood vessels are weak and can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. Surgeons often perform a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy to treat these problems. However, this surgery can be difficult because the abnormal blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the abnormal blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that giving these injections before surgery could make the operation safer and more successful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision. We also wanted to know if it reduces the risk of problems compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease. These problems included bleeding in the eye that does not clear on its own (called non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage). They also included scar tissue that pulls on the retina (called tractional retinal detachment). The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. In many studies, the people involved may have known which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Also, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
