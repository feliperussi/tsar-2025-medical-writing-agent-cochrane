    "output": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning helps treat gum disease. This therapy uses a special dye and light to kill germs. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the light-activated therapy.\n\nThe evidence is not strong enough for us to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. The standard treatment is a deep cleaning to remove the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants. This deep cleaning is also called ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nDoctors can add antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) aPDT treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe did the following:\n- We searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy.\n- We combined the results from the studies.\n- We rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone.\n\nFor people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- They used different methods to give the treatment.\n- People in the studies may have known which treatment they received.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024."
