    "output": "For women with endometriosis, what are the benefits and harms of treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (a type of hormone therapy)?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with endometriosis, a type of hormone therapy called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) may help to relieve pain when compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). However, this treatment may also cause unwanted effects, such as hot flushes, and may decrease bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).\n- The evidence is not strong, so we are not certain about these effects. More and better-quality studies are needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of this treatment, especially when compared to other options for endometriosis.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and how can it be treated?\nEndometriosis is a common condition affecting women of reproductive age. It occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside the womb, which can cause pain (such as painful periods or pain during sex) and infertility. One treatment option is a type of hormone therapy called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), which can help reduce this pain. However, these medicines can have side effects, including decreasing bone mineral density, which can lead to weaker bones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe GnRH analogues are for treating the painful symptoms of endometriosis when compared with other treatments, placebo (a dummy treatment), or no treatment. We also wanted to understand their effect on women's bone density, quality of life, and any other side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared this hormone therapy (GnRHas) with other treatments, placebo (a dummy treatment), or no treatment for women with endometriosis. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 72 studies involving 7355 women with endometriosis. The studies compared this hormone therapy (GnRHas) with placebo, danazol, or GnRHas combined with calcium-regulating agents. We did not find any studies that compared GnRHas with no treatment or with analgesics (painkillers). The treatment duration in the included studies ranged from 3 to 12 months.\n\nCompared to a placebo (a dummy treatment), this hormone therapy (GnRHas) may reduce endometriosis-related pain, including painful periods, pain during sex, and pelvic tenderness. However, GnRHas may greatly increase hot flushes. When comparing GnRHas with another medication called danazol, it is unclear if GnRHas affect endometriosis-related pain. Using GnRHas alone may slightly reduce bone mineral density compared to using them with calcium-regulating agents, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to May 2022."
