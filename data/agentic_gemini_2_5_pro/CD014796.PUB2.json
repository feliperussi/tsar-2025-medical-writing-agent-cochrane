    "output": "What are the views and experiences of the public, health professionals, and policymakers on general health check-ups?\n\nKey messages\n- General health check-ups are popular, even though research shows they do little to prevent illness or death. People find them reassuring and feel motivated to live healthier lives.\n- The evidence suggests the main reasons people avoid check-ups are fear of the results, the cost of potential follow-up treatment, and lack of time.\n- Health professionals found it hard to provide check-ups because of a lack of time, staff, and resources. They also noted that while people often liked having a wide range of tests, a better approach would be to match check-ups to a person's individual health risks.\n- The review found little evidence about why policymakers plan and fund health check-ups. More research is needed to understand this and to help plan for the future of these popular check-ups. This might include finding other ways to support people's health.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a set of tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The aim is to check a person's overall health and find any problems early, to try to reduce future illness and prevent death. However, a previous major review found that general health checks do little to prevent death from any cause, including from cancer or heart disease. This raises questions about why these checks are still so common and popular.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of the different groups of people involved in general health checks. We aimed to find out how the public, healthcare providers (such as doctors and nurses), and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services) view these checks. We wanted to look at what influences decisions to offer health checks, how they are provided, and why people decide to have them.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that asked people about their views and experiences of general health checks. We then brought together the findings from the most relevant studies and used a standard method to rate how confident we are in the combined evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 146 studies and looked closely at 36 of them for our analysis. The studies explored the views and experiences of the public, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers. Most studies were from high-income European countries, but nearly a third took place in middle-income countries.\n\nWe found that people’s personal beliefs about disease, risk, and preventing illness were important in their decision to get a health check. It is also important that the people providing health checks are skilled and sensitive to different cultures.\n\nFor people who get health checks, the experience motivates them to live more healthily and reassures them about their health. However, people are less likely to go if they fear bad results or prefer to wait for symptoms before seeing a doctor. Practical issues, like not having enough time or worrying about the cost of follow-up treatment, also affect whether people go.\n\nHealthcare providers play an important role in encouraging people to take part. However, health providers found it difficult to offer check-ups because of problems like lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources. Health professionals noted that while people often liked having a wide range of tests, a better approach would be to match check-ups to a person's individual health risks. Offering them in new and different places could help more people get them. For the public, it seems that a key part of the check is having the results explained and getting clear advice.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. The studies we included came from many different countries and involved various groups of people, which makes it hard to apply the findings to everyone. In some areas, there were also not enough studies for us to be certain about the results. More research would help confirm our conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
