    "output": "Can decision aids (tools that explain the pros and cons of medical options) help people make choices about treatments or screening tests?\n\nKey messages\n- When people use decision aids, they feel more knowledgeable and are clearer about what matters to them. They are also more involved in making the decision and are more likely to make choices that are consistent with their personal values. The review found no difference in feelings of regret about the decision.\n- Further studies are needed to understand if using decision aids affects whether people follow through with their chosen treatment, and the impact on healthcare costs and resources.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPeople often face difficult decisions about their health, such as choosing a treatment or deciding whether to have a screening test. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make these choices. These tools explain the decision clearly, provide evidence-based information about the different options (including their benefits and harms), and help people think about what is most important to them and their own personal values.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using patient decision aids helps adults make better health decisions compared to the usual care they get from their healthcare provider. We were interested in whether decision aids improve people's knowledge, help them make choices that align with their personal values, and increase their involvement in the decision-making process. We also wanted to know if there were any unwanted effects, such as people regretting their choice.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared patient decision aids with usual care for adults making health decisions. We included studies that directly compared these two approaches. We then combined the results of the studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 209 studies involving a total of 107,698 adults. These studies compared patient decision aids to usual care for 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening (for colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer), cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. Compared to usual care, patient decision aids probably help more people make choices that are in line with their personal values. Patient decision aids greatly increased people's knowledge of their health options and their ability to understand risks. People using them felt more informed, were more certain about what was important to them, and took a more active role in making decisions. Using a decision aid makes little to no difference to whether people regret their decision.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data on everything we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous version. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
