    "output": "For a complex bulge in the main artery in the belly (abdominal aortic aneurysm), is a special type of keyhole surgery (fenestrated endovascular repair) a better treatment than traditional open surgery or no surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not determine if a special type of keyhole surgery (fenestrated endovascular repair) is a better treatment than traditional open surgery or no surgery for a complex bulge in the main artery in the belly (abdominal aortic aneurysm). This is because we found no robust studies that directly compared these treatments.\n- High-quality research is needed to compare the benefits and harms of these different ways of treating complex bulges in the main artery in the belly to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nWhat is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm?\nThe aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart down through the abdomen. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge or swelling in this blood vessel. If an aneurysm gets too big, it can burst, which is a life-threatening emergency. These aneurysms are considered 'complex' when the bulge is very close to the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys and other organs, making them more difficult to treat. The main treatments are traditional open surgery, which involves a large cut in the abdomen to repair the aorta, or a less invasive procedure called fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). FEVAR uses a special tube (a stent-graft) with custom-made holes that allow blood to keep flowing to the kidney arteries after the repair.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what the best treatment is for people with complex AAAs. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of FEVAR against open surgical repair or conservative management (monitoring the aneurysm without an operation).\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or no surgery in adults with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause no studies were found, there is no evidence to answer our review question. We cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of FEVAR compared to other treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023."
