    "output": "For women who leak urine, what is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle exercises?\n\nFor women who leak urine, exercises that focus only on the pelvic floor muscles may work better than general exercises. Exercising on more days per week may also help. It probably makes little difference whether women do these exercises with a supervisor in a group or one-on-one. Unwanted effects were not common and were mostly minor, like discomfort or spotting when using training devices.\n\nUsing health tools on a phone or computer (like a mobile app) for instructions and support may be slightly better than using written instructions alone.\n\nWe are still unsure about the best way to do many parts of pelvic floor muscle training because there isn't enough strong evidence. We need more and better studies to find the most effective 'dose' of exercise (for example, how many muscle squeezes to do and how often).\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence is when you leak urine when you don't want to. It's a common problem for women. It can happen when you cough or sneeze (this is called 'stress incontinence'), or when you feel a sudden, strong need to pee ('urgency incontinence'). Sometimes, it's a mix of both. To help with this, doctors often recommend exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles (called PFMT). These are the muscles that support your bladder. Health professionals can teach these exercises in many different ways. This includes the type of exercise, how often women do it (the dose), and how women get the training (for example, with a therapist in a clinic, in a group, or at home).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training work best for women who leak urine. We compared different types of exercise, different doses of exercise, and different ways of delivering the training to see how they affected incontinence.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training, including the type of exercise, the dose, and how it was delivered. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 63 studies with a total of 4920 women. The women in the studies were mostly middle-aged (45 to 65 years old) and had given birth. Most had stress incontinence or a mix of stress and urgency incontinence. The studies took place in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings.\n\nWe compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training to see how they affected women's daily lives and feelings of control over their incontinence. We found that:\n– Combining body movements with pelvic floor muscle squeezes (called 'co-ordinated training') may help women feel better and more in control.\n– Exercising on more days per week may also help women feel better.\n– Exercises that focus only on the pelvic floor muscles may work better than general exercises.\n– Adding general exercises to a program of pelvic floor muscle exercises may make little to no difference.\n– It probably makes little to no difference whether a health professional supervises the exercises for one person or for a group.\n– Getting instructions through health tools on a phone or computer (like a mobile app) may be slightly better than using written instructions alone.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies were very small, and some did not give us all the information we were interested in. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to provide the training. This makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is up-to-date to September 2023."
