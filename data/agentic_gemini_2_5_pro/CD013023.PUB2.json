    "output": "What are the effects of different dressings and devices for preventing problems with arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery to take blood samples and measure blood pressure)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear whether different types of dressings or devices are better than others for preventing problems with arterial catheters.\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to find out which dressings and devices are most effective for preventing catheter failure and infections.\n\nWhat are peripheral arterial catheters?\nPeople in hospital, particularly in intensive care or during surgery, may have a thin tube called a peripheral arterial catheter placed into an artery, often in the wrist. These catheters allow healthcare staff to take blood samples and monitor blood pressure at all times without using new needles each time. However, these catheters can sometimes stop working properly (fail), meaning they need to be replaced. They can also lead to complications, such as the catheter coming out (becoming dislodged), getting blocked, or causing an infection. Special dressings and devices are used to secure the catheter to the skin to keep it working and prevent these problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective different dressings and securement devices are at preventing peripheral arterial catheters from failing and causing complications for people in hospital.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared different dressings and securement devices for arterial catheters. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 5 studies with a total of 1228 people in hospital. The studies compared different types of dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters. We are uncertain which dressing or device is best for preventing catheter problems.\n\nThe evidence suggests that some special dressings may make little or no difference compared to standard dressings. These include:\n- bordered dressings (with a sticky edge)\n- integrated securement dressings (with a built-in holder)\n\nUsing these special dressings may not change the risk of problems like:\n- catheter failure\n- bloodstream infections\n- the catheter coming out (dislodgement)\n- blockage\n\nWe also looked at adding medical glue (a tissue adhesive) or a stitch-free holder (a sutureless securement device) to a standard dressing. We do not know if these options affect the risk of problems, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. The studies were also very small. This means that problems like infections or blockages did not happen often enough for us to draw strong conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
