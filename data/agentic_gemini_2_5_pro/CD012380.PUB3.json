    "output": "What are the effects of treatments to prevent or reduce long-term kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether treatments such as hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors (a type of medicine that lowers blood pressure) can prevent or reduce long-term kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease.\n- In very young children, hydroxyurea may improve the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, and may make little or no difference to the number of serious health problems.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and how does it affect the kidneys?\nSickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder. It can cause many health problems, including severe pain and damage to major organs. The kidneys are often affected. This damage, known as chronic kidney disease, can begin in childhood and get worse over time, sometimes leading to kidney failure where the kidneys stop working.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective different treatments are for preventing or reducing kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We looked at evidence for several treatments, including a medicine called hydroxyurea, a type of blood pressure medicine called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and red blood cell transfusions, used either alone or together.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nTo find all the relevant studies, we searched major medical databases. We looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to receive a treatment or a different treatment (or a placebo, a dummy treatment). We then compared the results from the studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 3 studies with a total of 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies compared hydroxyurea to a placebo in young children; a type of blood pressure medicine called an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to a placebo in adults; and an ACE inhibitor to vitamin C in children.\n\nFor young children with sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea may improve the ability of their kidneys to concentrate urine. It may make little to no difference to the number of serious problems like severe chest problems, pain, or hospital stays. We do not know if hydroxyurea has an effect on overall kidney function.\n\nFor adults with sickle cell disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor reduces protein in the urine when compared to a placebo. Similarly, for children with the disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor has an effect on the amount of protein in the urine when compared to vitamin C.\n\nThe review found no studies on using blood transfusions to prevent or reduce kidney problems. Due to a lack of research, we cannot draw conclusions about the best way to manage kidney problems for children older than 18 months or for most adults with sickle cell disease.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because of concerns about how the studies were designed. In addition, the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe abstract does not specify a search date, so the evidence currency cannot be determined."
