    "output": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Compared to surgery with a scope, surgery through the back may lead to more people being stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. Treatment for kidney stones depends on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are surgery through the back and surgery with a scope. In surgery through the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy), a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In surgery with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery), a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, surgery through the back and surgery with a scope, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We then rated our confidence in the overall evidence based on factors like study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials that included 4571 adults with kidney stones. These studies compared surgery through the back with surgery with a scope. The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nWhen comparing the two procedures, we found that surgery through the back:\n- may lead to more people being stone-free.\n- may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation.\n- may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- probably makes little or no difference to the risk of major complications.\n- may make little or no difference to the risk of injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney (ureteral stricture).\n\nWe found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all studies provided the data we were interested in. Also, the studies included people with a wide range of stone sizes and used surgical tools of various sizes, which makes it hard to be certain how well each procedure works in specific situations.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023."
