    "output": "What are the effects of sinus surgery for people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\n\nKey messages\n\nDue to a lack of strong evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of sinus surgery for people with cystic fibrosis who have growths in the nose (nasal polyps). It is not clear if the surgery improves nose-related symptoms or lung function. One episode of bleeding during surgery was reported in the single small study found.\n\nLarger and longer-term studies are needed to find out if sinus surgery is helpful and safe for people of all ages with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. In the nose and sinuses, this mucus can cause long-term swelling and lead to the growth of non-cancerous lumps called nasal polyps. This condition is known as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. These polyps can block the sinuses, making it difficult to breathe through the nose and leading to infections. One treatment option is endoscopic sinus surgery, a procedure to open the sinuses and remove the polyps, which may help other medical treatments work better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective sinus surgery is for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We compared people who had sinus surgery (with or without other medical treatments) to people who had medical treatments alone. We were interested in the effects on both nasal symptoms and lung function. We also wanted to know if surgery affected how often people were hospitalized, needed antibiotics, or had flare-ups of their lung condition (pulmonary exacerbations).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment for people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included one study with 28 participants aged 19 to 28 years with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study compared a combination of nasal irrigation and surgery against nasal irrigation alone. The surgery was a procedure to remove polyps and open the sinuses (endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy). For people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps, the review found very uncertain evidence about the effects of adding sinus surgery to medical treatment (such as nasal rinses). Therefore, we do not know if adding surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial infections in the sinuses, or lessens the need for antibiotics. We also do not know if it affects lung function or the number of lung flare-ups compared with medical treatment alone.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThis review includes evidence published up to September 2022."
