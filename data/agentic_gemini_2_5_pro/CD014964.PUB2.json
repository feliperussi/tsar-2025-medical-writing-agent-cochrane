    "output": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Using ultrasound to guide spinal injections in adults reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the time it takes to do the procedure compared to the usual method of feeling for bones. It also likely increases the chance of success on the first try.\n- We are uncertain if using ultrasound makes a difference to pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects. More research is needed to know if it improves how satisfied patients are or prevents the injection from failing.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief involving an injection in the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors usually feel for bones in the back (called anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. This method can be difficult and may not always be precise, sometimes requiring several needle attempts. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable and may cause more problems for the patient. An ultrasound machine creates a picture of the inside of the body and could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the usual method of feeling for bones. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to succeed on the first attempt;\n- needed fewer needle attempts overall;\n- took less time to do;\n- made patients more satisfied;\n- caused less pain or other unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for bones for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults. About half of the studies involved people in labour or having a caesarean section. The other studies involved adults having different types of surgery. All studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back.\n\nMain results\nCompared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults:\n- reduces the number of needle attempts needed;\n- shortens the time it takes to do the procedure;\n- probably increases the chance of success on the first try.\n\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if it affects pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in some of the evidence. This is because some studies were small or designed in ways that could lead to unreliable results. This means the findings may not apply to all patients in all situations.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023."
