    "output": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably helps keep the disease in remission better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another type of anti-inflammatory medicine than when that medicine is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called TNF-alpha. This leads to symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. The goal when treating Crohn's disease is to reduce this swelling and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are reduced or gone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-alpha to control the swelling. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after symptoms are already under control, and what side effects it might cause.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who were new to a type of medicine called a 'biologic,' which are complex medicines made from living things. One study focused only on people with fistulas. These are abnormal tunnels that can form between the gut and other parts of the body because of Crohn's disease.\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (another type of anti-inflammatory medicine or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people who take infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person experiences a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another type of anti-inflammatory medicine probably leads to far fewer relapses than using that medicine alone. For every 100 people treated with the anti-inflammatory medicine alone, 59 experienced a relapse. This number dropped to 12 when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also lead to many more people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain about infliximab's effect on side effects because the evidence is unclear. We do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab. We also don't know if giving a biosimilar in different ways (under the skin or into a vein) changes how well it works or the side effects it causes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is mainly because some studies were small, and the way they were conducted could have introduced errors into the results. Also, not all studies reported on the side effects we were interested in, leaving gaps in the evidence.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023."
