    "output": "Combining health services: what research is there on healthcare workers' views?\n\nKey messages\n– This review found and mapped the available research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of combining different health services. It does not present the findings of that research.\n– We found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of combining services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We mapped the existing research to show what has been studied. Other researchers can use this map to group similar studies. This will help them better understand how combining services in different ways affects healthcare workers and whether these programs work well.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nPrimary healthcare is the first type of care a person usually receives, such as from a family doctor or local clinic. In many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrating health services means people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is seen as a good way to achieve good healthcare for everyone, especially in countries with limited resources. How well these new, combined services work often depends on the healthcare workers who provide the care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have looked at healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to create a map of all this existing research. We wanted to understand the range of available studies, see what topics they covered, and find any gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of health services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of combining health services, such as integrating mental health services with general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the available research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of combining services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence we found. The studies were done with many different types of people and used different ways of combining services. This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions that apply broadly.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020."
