    "output": "Which ways of using nicotine replacement therapy (like patches or gum) are most effective for quitting smoking?\n\nKey messages\nThe most effective way to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to combine a nicotine patch with a faster-acting form, like gum or a lozenge. Higher-dose patches may also be more effective than lower-dose ones, and starting NRT before the quit day may also help people to quit. The review found limited information on the unwanted effects of different ways of using NRT.\nFuture research is needed to better understand the potential unwanted effects of different ways of using nicotine replacement therapy and to confirm if starting it before the quit day is helpful.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and how can it help people stop smoking?\nStopping smoking is difficult because tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that provides nicotine in the form of gums, patches, sprays, or lozenges. The aim is to replace the nicotine a person would get from cigarettes, which helps to reduce unpleasant withdrawal symptoms and cravings. This can make it easier for people to stop smoking completely.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe know that NRT helps people to stop smoking. However, there are many different ways to use NRT. For example, people can use different forms (like a patch plus a gum), different doses (strengths), and use it for different lengths of time. We wanted to find out if some ways of using NRT are more effective and safer than others for helping people to stop smoking long-term.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different forms, doses, and ways of using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to help people stop smoking. We compared and summarized the results from all the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors like how the studies were conducted and how many people took part.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review found 68 studies in 43,327 adults who wanted to stop smoking. The studies compared different types, doses, and ways of using NRT, such as using a patch plus a fast-acting form (like gum or a lozenge) versus a single product, different patch strengths, and starting NRT before versus on the quit day. All studies followed people for at least 6 months.\n\nWhat did the review find about the most effective ways to use NRT?\nUsing a combination of NRTs (a patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge) helps more people to stop smoking than using just one type of NRT. Starting to use NRT before the planned quit day may also help more people to quit than starting on the quit day. Using a standard-strength patch (21 mg or 25 mg) probably helps more people to quit than a lower-strength patch (14 mg or 15 mg). However, using a higher-strength patch (such as 42 mg or 44 mg) probably makes little to no difference compared with a standard-strength patch (21 mg or 25 mg). We are uncertain if using NRT for longer helps more people to quit, or if one type of fast-acting NRT is better than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are only moderately confident in our findings for a few reasons. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results. Also, not all studies provided the data we were looking for, especially on the safety of the treatments.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The search for studies is up to date to April 2022."
