    "output": "What impact do immune checkpoint inhibitors have on treating glioma?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with glioma (an aggressive brain tumour), medicines that help the immune system fight cancer ('immune checkpoint inhibitors') probably do not help people live longer or stop the cancer from growing for longer. We are also uncertain about their serious unwanted effects.\n- We found one small study suggesting that giving one of these immune medicines before and after surgery might help people whose brain tumour has returned.\n- Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we need larger and better-designed studies to find out if these immune medicines can help treat glioma.\n\nWhat is glioma?\n\nGlioma is a type of brain cancer. The most common and aggressive type is called glioblastoma. People diagnosed with it often live for a very short time. This cancer is hard to treat because it weakens the body's immune system, which stops it from fighting the cancer well. A type of medicine called an 'immune checkpoint inhibitor' is designed to help the immune system find and attack cancer cells.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat adults with glioma is effective and safe. We were interested in whether these immune medicines helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from growing for longer, and if they caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are put into different treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared immune checkpoint inhibitor medicines against other treatments or a placebo (a dummy treatment) for adults with glioma. We then compared and summarised the results of the studies. We also judged how certain the evidence made us about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 7 studies with a total of 1953 adults with glioblastoma. The number of people in each study ranged from 35 to 716. 4 studies included people whose glioblastoma had returned. 3 studies included people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, one of which focused on older adults. The studies tested two types of these immune medicines. People in the studies received these medicines either alone or with other cancer treatments. We compared their results to people who received other treatments or a placebo.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nFor people whose glioblastoma has returned, using one of the immune medicines alone probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they stop the cancer from growing for longer. We compared this to another medicine for brain tumours. Giving a different immune medicine both before and after surgery may help people live longer, but we are very uncertain about this result. We are uncertain if using these medicines in other combinations helps people live longer or if they cause serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, adding an immune medicine to standard radiation therapy probably makes little to no difference to how long people live or how long they stop the cancer from growing for longer. When an immune medicine is added to standard radiation and chemotherapy, it also probably makes little to no difference to how long people live. However, it probably increases serious unwanted effects. It makes little to no difference to less serious unwanted effects.\n\nOverall, the evidence we reviewed suggests these immune medicines do not work well for glioblastoma. They probably do not help people live longer and may increase serious unwanted effects in some cases. For many results, the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were receiving. This could affect the results, as people's expectations can influence how they feel. Also, the studies included different types of people, and we did not find enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
