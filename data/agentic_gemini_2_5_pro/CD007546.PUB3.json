    "output": "What can be done to reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n- Programmes that change a care home's overall culture are likely the most effective way to reduce the use of physical restraints (like bedrails or belts). These programmes, which include staff education and new policies, seem to reduce restraint use without increasing falls.\n- It is unclear if simpler approaches, such as providing staff with education alone, are effective at reducing the use of physical restraints.\n- All the evidence comes from care homes, so we do not know if these approaches would work for people receiving care in their own homes. Future studies should also look more closely at any potential unwanted effects of these programmes.\n\nWhat are physical restraints and why is their use a problem in long-term care?\nPhysical restraints are devices used to limit a person's movement. Examples include belts used in chairs or beds, and bedrails. They are often used for older people living in long-term care settings, such as nursing homes. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are often not effective or safe, and many guidelines recommend that they should be avoided.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what kinds of approaches or programmes are effective for preventing and reducing the use of physical restraints for older people receiving long-term care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested ways to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We compared and summarized the results, and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 11 studies with a total of 19,003 participants. All studies took place in nursing homes and included older people with dementia, with an average age of about 85 years. We found no studies that looked at people receiving care in their own homes. The studies tested 3 types of approaches:\n- programmes to change a care home's overall approach to using fewer restraints (4 studies);\n- simple educational programmes for staff (6 studies); and\n- providing staff with information about residents' fall risk (1 study).\nIn most studies, these approaches were compared to the usual care provided in the home.\n\nWhat were the main findings?\nProgrammes that change a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably reduce how many residents are restrained. These programmes seem especially effective at reducing the use of belts. These changes likely have little to no effect on residents' quality of life or the number of mood-altering medications they are prescribed. They may also have little to no effect on the number of falls or fall-related injuries.\nWe are uncertain if simply educating staff, without other changes, reduces the use of physical restraints. Providing staff with information about a resident's risk of falling may also make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because of problems with how some of the studies were designed. For example, in several studies, there was a high risk that the groups of residents being compared were not similar at the start of the study. This could have affected the results, which means we are less certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
