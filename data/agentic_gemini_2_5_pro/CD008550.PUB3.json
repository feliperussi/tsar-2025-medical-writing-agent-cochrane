    "output": "What are the effects of medicines for treating reflux (the backward flow of stomach contents) in children?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether medicines for reflux (the backward flow of stomach contents into the food pipe) improve symptoms in infants and children. The review did not find clear information about the unwanted or harmful effects of these treatments.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if these medicines are helpful. Future research should follow children for longer to check for long-term effects and should include specific groups, such as premature babies and children with long-term health conditions.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\n\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is when stomach contents come back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). It is very common in babies, affecting about half of infants under 3 months old. In most babies, reflux is normal and gets better by itself as they grow. However, for some babies and older children, the symptoms can be more severe, causing problems like pain, crying, or difficulty feeding. When reflux is severe enough to need medical treatment, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children, and whether they cause any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared drug treatments for reflux in children and infants against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 36 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2251 children and infants up to 16 years old with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies compared different medicines for reflux against a placebo or another medication. For infants with reflux, it is unclear if medications such as omeprazole and esomeprazole have an effect on symptoms compared to a placebo. For older children with reflux disease, it is also unclear if these medicines improve their outcomes. Giving different doses of these medications may make little to no difference to symptoms, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the treatments, the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up-to-date to September 2022."
