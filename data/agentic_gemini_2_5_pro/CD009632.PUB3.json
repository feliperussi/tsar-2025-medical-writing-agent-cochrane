    "output": "For women at average risk of breast cancer, what are the benefits and harms of adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram for screening?\n\nKey messages\n- For women at average risk of breast cancer, adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram helps to find more breast cancers. However, this combination also leads to more women being told they might have cancer when they do not (a false-positive result), and more women having biopsies they did not need.\n- We do not know if finding more breast cancers by adding an ultrasound to a mammogram leads to fewer deaths from breast cancer. Studies that follow women for longer are needed to answer this important question.\n\nWhy add an ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening?\nScreening with a mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) can help to find breast cancer at an early stage. Some believe that adding a breast ultrasound to the screening process could help find cancers that mammograms might miss (a 'false-negative' result). However, others are concerned that adding an ultrasound could also increase the number of 'false-positive' results. A false-positive result is when a test suggests cancer might be present, but it turns out not to be cancer. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety and further procedures, such as a biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is taken to be examined).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using mammograms with breast ultrasound versus using mammograms alone for breast cancer screening in women who are at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared breast cancer screening using mammograms with ultrasound versus mammograms alone. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 8 studies with a total of 209,207 women aged 40 to 75 at average risk for breast cancer. The studies followed women for 1 to 3 years. The percentage of women with dense breasts in the studies ranged from 48% to 100%. The studies compared screening with mammograms alone to screening with mammograms and breast ultrasound together. None of the studies looked at whether using both tests saves lives by reducing deaths from breast cancer.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor women at average risk of breast cancer, adding an ultrasound to a mammogram for screening finds more breast cancers. For every 1000 women screened, this combination finds about 2 more breast cancers over 2 years compared to mammograms alone. Adding an ultrasound also reduces the number of cancers that appear between screening appointments and probably reduces the number of missed cancers. For women who had cancer that could spread, the combination of tests was more likely to find it before it reached the lymph nodes (glands near the breast).\n\nHowever, adding an ultrasound also has downsides. It increases the number of incorrect results that suggest cancer is present when it is not (false-positive results). For every 1000 women without cancer, about 37 more will receive a false-positive result. This also increases the number of women who need a biopsy. For every 1000 women screened, about 27 more will have a biopsy.\n\nWe do not know if adding an ultrasound to mammograms saves lives because none of the studies looked at this.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because of how the studies were designed. In most studies, women were not assigned to the screening groups by chance. This means any differences found might be due to differences between the women themselves, not just the screening tests. Also, the studies did not measure all the important outcomes. Importantly, none of the studies looked at whether adding an ultrasound to mammograms saves lives.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to May 2021."
