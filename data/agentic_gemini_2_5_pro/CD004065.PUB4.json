    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with eosinophilic esophagitis, medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce swelling in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but we are uncertain if biologics do.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for people taking biologics.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to compare them directly to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This allergic response inflames the food pipe, which can make it hard to swallow, cause food to get stuck, and lead to chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medicines are for people with EoE. We looked at whether these treatments improved symptoms, reduced swelling in the food pipe, and caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for EoE against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nWe found 41 studies that included 3253 people with EoE.\n- The studies included both children and adults (11 studies focused only on children).\n- Most people had 'active' EoE, meaning their symptoms were present. 4 studies looked at people with 'inactive' disease, where symptoms were under control.\n- The review looked at 19 different treatments, but we focused on the two main ones compared against a placebo: corticosteroids and biologics.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active EoE, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe by lowering the number of the white blood cells (eosinophils) that cause it. For every 3 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, 1 extra person felt their symptoms improve.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment because of unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced. However, the evidence was less clear about *how much* the swelling was reduced.\n- We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. This is because studies measured symptoms in different ways, which gave mixed results. Some studies showed a benefit, while others showed little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to how the food pipe looks when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people who take a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have low to moderate confidence in the evidence. This is because some results came from a small number of studies. Also, studies often measured outcomes differently (for example, some counted *if* people improved, while others measured *how much* they improved). This made it hard to combine the results and be certain about our conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
