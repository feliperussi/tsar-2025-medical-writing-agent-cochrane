    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia, the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. However, these treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.\n- The evidence is based on a small number of studies, so it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other medicines and to find the best ways to run studies for these rare conditions.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition that makes it hard for muscles to relax after you use them. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and tiredness, which can be disabling. Myotonia is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types of myotonic disorders are myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. Myotonic dystrophy also affects other parts of the body, such as the heart and eyes. In non-dystrophic myotonia, the condition mainly affects the muscles. Doctors use different drugs to help reduce myotonia symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different drugs reduce myotonia symptoms and whether they cause any unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance). In these studies, drug treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 392 people. The people in the studies had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies mainly tested the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine against a placebo. The studies also looked at several other drugs, but the evidence for them was unclear.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably helps hand muscles relax faster than a placebo. However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and makes their grip stronger. It may also improve their quality of life. However, the drug probably makes little to no difference to how quickly their hand and eye muscles relax. It may also increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life. It may also help hand and eyelid muscles relax faster. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, tiredness, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs looked at for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate, mainly because most of the studies were very small. Also, for some of the less common drugs, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. If people knew which treatment they were getting, it might have changed how they reported their symptoms. This could have affected the study's results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
