    "output": "After weight-loss surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), does closing surgical gaps in the abdomen prevent a twisted bowel (internal hernia)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing the surgical gaps inside the abdomen may reduce the risk of a serious complication where the bowel twists (internal hernia). There appears to be little to no difference in other unwanted effects or death shortly after the surgery.\n- Our confidence in these findings is limited because they are based on a small number of studies. More research is needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of closing these surgical gaps.\n\nWhat is an internal hernia after weight-loss surgery?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. The procedure involves creating a small stomach pouch and rearranging the small intestine. This rearrangement can leave small surgical gaps inside the abdomen. A serious complication can occur if part of the intestine slips through one of these gaps, causing a blockage or twisting. This is called an internal hernia. To prevent this, some surgeons stitch these gaps closed during the original operation. However, there is a concern that closing the gaps might increase the risk of other problems, such as a blockage in the small intestine.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these surgical gaps compared to leaving them open for people having this type of weight-loss surgery. We wanted to know if closing the gaps reduces the risk of internal hernias and whether it affects the risk of other complications, death, or the length of the hospital stay.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance. These studies compared closing surgical gaps with not closing them in people having gastric bypass surgery. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with 3010 people with obesity who were having this type of weight-loss surgery. The studies compared closing surgical gaps with not closing them. People in the studies were followed for up to 10 years after their surgery. The studies did not say where they took place or who funded them.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nClosing surgical gaps during this type of weight-loss surgery may reduce the risk of a serious complication called an internal hernia. However, closing the gaps may make little to no difference to the number of overall complications in the month after surgery. We are very uncertain about the effect on the risk of death after surgery or on complications during the operation. Closing the gaps may also increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is based on only a few studies. This means we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024."
