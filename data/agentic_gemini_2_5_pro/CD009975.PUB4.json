    "output": "For newborn babies, is using a tool with a video camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than the standard method (direct laryngoscopy) for placing a breathing tube?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For newborn babies who need a breathing tube, using a tool with a video camera (videolaryngoscopy) may increase the chance of placing the tube successfully on the first try and may lead to fewer attempts compared to the standard method (direct laryngoscopy). The video method also likely causes slightly less injury to the baby's airway.\n- Better-designed studies with more babies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of using video cameras to help place breathing tubes in newborns.\n\nWhy is helping newborn babies to breathe so important?\nSome newborn babies (neonates) have trouble breathing and need emergency help. To help them, doctors often need to place a tube into their windpipe (a procedure called endotracheal intubation). This allows the baby to be connected to a machine that helps them breathe. Getting the tube in place quickly and correctly is critical, as delays or multiple attempts can be harmful. The standard method for this procedure is called 'direct laryngoscopy', where a doctor uses a special lighted instrument to look directly into the baby's throat to guide the tube. A newer method, 'videolaryngoscopy', uses a similar instrument but with a tiny camera on the end. This camera sends a picture to a video screen, which may give the doctor a better view of the baby's airway.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if using videolaryngoscopy is better and safer than direct laryngoscopy for placing breathing tubes in newborn babies (from birth to 28 days old). They compared the two methods to see which one: \n- was more successful on the first try;\n- was faster;\n- required fewer attempts; and\n- resulted in fewer harms, such as injury to the airway or drops in the baby's oxygen levels.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for inserting a breathing tube in newborn babies. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that provided data on 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included male and female babies up to 28 days of age who were having a breathing tube inserted. The review compared videolaryngoscopy (using devices with a camera, such as C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope) with direct laryngoscopy (using a standard device).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to the standard method, using a tool with a video camera:\n- may increase the success of putting the tube in on the first try. For every 7 babies who have this procedure, one extra baby may benefit from a successful first attempt.\n- may slightly reduce the number of attempts needed to insert the tube.\n- probably slightly reduces airway injury. For every 25 babies who have this procedure, one case of airway injury is probably prevented.\n- may make little to no difference to the time it takes to insert the tube or to the lowest oxygen levels during the procedure.\n- We do not know if it has an effect on episodes of low oxygen levels or slow heart rate because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because people in the studies may have known which method was being used, which could have affected the results. Also, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022."
