    "output": "Can programs run by community or primary care health workers help to prevent mental health problems and improve mental well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKey messages\n\n- In low- and middle-income countries, programs run by community or primary care health workers may help to improve mental well-being and reduce symptoms of common mental health problems like anxiety and depression in both adults and children. The review found limited information about unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in the study designs. This makes the results less certain and means we need better-quality research in the future.\n\nHow can we improve mental health support in places with limited resources?\n\nMental health is a key part of overall well-being. However, many low- and middle-income countries do not have enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to care for everyone. One possible solution is to train primary care and community health workers to deliver mental health support. This approach, sometimes called 'task-shifting', can help more people get care. This support can be for everyone, for people at higher risk of mental health problems, or for people already showing early signs of a problem.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if mental health support delivered by primary care and community health workers is effective for adults and children in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, we wanted to know if these programs could help improve well-being and prevent mental health problems. We also looked at whether these programs affected costs or how often people used healthcare services.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called 'randomized controlled trials'. In these studies, people were randomly assigned to either receive the new mental health support or the usual care. This helps make the comparison fair. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 113 studies with 32,992 adults and children in various low- and middle-income countries. The studies compared these programs to the usual care people received.\n\nFor adults, programs for people at high risk of mental health problems probably cause a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms. Programs for everyone probably reduce anxiety symptoms slightly.\n\nFor children, programs for everyone may improve quality of life slightly and slightly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children at high risk, these programs probably reduce symptoms of distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) slightly. However, they seem to make little to no difference for symptoms of depression. For children with early signs of a disorder, it is unclear if the programs have an effect.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because people in the studies often knew which program they were in, which could have influenced the results. Also, the results varied because the studies included different types of people and used different support programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021."
