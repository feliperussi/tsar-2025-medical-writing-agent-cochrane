    "output": "What are the best treatments for blood clots in fistulas and grafts (surgically created access points for dialysis)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear which treatment is best for clearing blood clots from surgically created access points for dialysis (fistulas or grafts). We found insufficient evidence to know if any specific treatment is better than another at keeping the access point open or at reducing unwanted effects.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to find out the most effective and safest way to treat blood clots in dialysis access points. Future research should focus on outcomes that are important to patients, such as how long the access point remains usable and the success of future dialysis sessions.\n\nWhat is the problem with blocked blood access for people on haemodialysis?\nPeople whose kidneys have failed often need a treatment called haemodialysis, where a machine cleans their blood. To connect to the machine, a surgeon creates a special access point, usually in the arm, by joining an artery and a vein. This is called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or an arteriovenous graft (AVG). Sometimes, these access points can get blocked by a blood clot (a process called thrombosis). When this happens, the person cannot have their dialysis and must use a temporary tube (a catheter), which increases their risk of serious infections and other complications. There are several ways to treat a blocked access point, including surgery, procedures to physically remove the clot (thrombectomy), and using medicines to dissolve the clot (thrombolysis). However, it is not clear which treatment is best.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe the different treatments are for unblocking clotted arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) in people receiving haemodialysis. We wanted to compare these treatments to see which ones worked best to restore blood flow and prevent future blockages, and which had the fewest unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for clotted fistulas or grafts in people receiving hemodialysis. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nThe review included 14 studies with 1176 people on haemodialysis who had a blocked arteriovenous fistula or graft. The studies compare different techniques for removing blood clots, including clot-dissolving drugs and surgery. Due to a lack of reliable evidence, it is unclear whether any specific treatment is better than another. We do not know if any intervention improves the chances of keeping the access open after one month, prevents treatment failure, or affects the risk of unwanted effects. The current research is not strong enough to guide decisions on the best way to treat this condition.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to January 2024."
