    "output": "Does reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (audit and feedback) improve the care they provide to patients?\n\nKey messages\n\nThe evidence suggests that reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (a process called audit and feedback) can lead to small but potentially important improvements in the care they provide. The review did not find any studies that reported on unwanted effects of this approach.\n\nAudit and feedback may be more effective when it targets areas where professionals have lots of room to improve, is given to individuals rather than teams, compares performance to top performers, and includes a specific plan for improvement.\n\nMore research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the most effective ways to design audit and feedback to improve healthcare.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback?\n\nHealthcare professionals, like doctors and nurses, aim to provide the best possible care. 'Audit and feedback' is a widely used strategy to help them improve. It involves two steps. First, an 'audit' measures a professional's performance over a period of time. For example, it might track how often a doctor prescribes a certain medicine or orders a specific test. Then, 'feedback' is given, where the results of the audit are shared with the professional. The idea is that when professionals see data about their own work, it encourages them to make positive changes. However, it is uncertain how well audit and feedback works and what makes it most effective.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if audit and feedback helps healthcare professionals improve the care they provide to patients. We also wanted to identify which features of audit and feedback might make it work better.\n\nHow did we do the review?\n\nWe searched for and collected all studies that tested audit and feedback. We then compared and combined the results to find out how well it works overall, and which ways of giving feedback are most effective. We also assessed the quality of the studies to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 292 studies. 26 of these studies were done in low- or middle-income countries. In most studies, the feedback was given to doctors. The studies tested if audit and feedback, sometimes with other support like education or reminders, improved the care professionals provide, such as prescribing medicines or ordering tests.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nAudit and feedback probably leads to a small improvement in the care that healthcare professionals provide. The size of this improvement can vary. This means that for every 100 opportunities to follow a recommended practice, audit and feedback probably leads to it being followed about 6 more times.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence is not higher because in some studies, professionals knew they were being observed, which might have changed their behaviour. Also, the studies used many different feedback methods, which made the results less consistent.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nThe evidence in this review is current to February 2022."
