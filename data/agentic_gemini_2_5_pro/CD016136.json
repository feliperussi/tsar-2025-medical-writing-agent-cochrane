    "output": "Is IV iron safer and more effective than oral iron for treating anemia in pregnancy?\n\nKey messages\n- For pregnant people with anaemia (low iron), giving iron through a vein (intravenously) is likely better at raising haemoglobin levels than iron taken by mouth. Haemoglobin is a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen. However, giving iron through a vein does not seem to change the risk of serious problems, like heavy bleeding after birth or needing a blood transfusion.\n- We found very little reliable information about other serious side effects for either treatment because the studies did not report them well. Future studies should focus on collecting better information on safety, especially for rare but important problems.\n\nWhat is iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\nDuring pregnancy, the body needs more iron to support the growing baby. If a person does not have enough iron, they can develop iron-deficiency anaemia. This is a condition where the blood has fewer red blood cells than normal. It can lead to health problems for both the mother and baby. The most common treatment is iron taken by mouth (oral iron) in pills or liquids. Another option is to give iron directly into a vein through a drip (intravenous iron).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how intravenous iron compares with oral iron for treating iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnant people. We looked at which treatment is better at improving iron levels and reducing anaemia. We also wanted to understand how safe both treatments are by looking at their side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared giving iron into a vein with giving it by mouth to treat anaemia in pregnant people. We then combined and compared the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies with 3939 pregnant people who had iron-deficiency anaemia. Most studies took place in India and Africa. The studies compared giving iron directly into a vein with iron taken by mouth. Most studies did not report how long they lasted or who funded them.\n\nCompared to oral iron, giving iron through a vein probably increases haemoglobin levels and probably means fewer people had anaemia, both during pregnancy and around the time of birth. After birth, intravenous iron may slightly increase haemoglobin levels and may mean fewer people had anaemia. However, we do not know if it affects severe anaemia.\n\nRegarding safety, giving iron through a vein probably makes little to no difference to the need for a blood transfusion or to breastfeeding rates. It may also make little to no difference to heavy bleeding after birth.\n\nFor other side effects, intravenous iron probably makes little to no difference to the risk of severe infections or a long hospital stay. It may make little to no difference to needing intensive care or the number of serious side effects. We are very uncertain about the effect on the number of mothers who die.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for a few reasons:\n- The studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n- There were not enough studies to be certain about some results.\n- The studies included different groups of people or used different ways to give the iron treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
