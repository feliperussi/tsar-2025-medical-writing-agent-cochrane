    "output": "Can psychological therapies, such as talking therapy, help people with inflammatory bowel disease (a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The link may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their feelings might also affect their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological therapies (such as talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques) have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results about how well they work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological therapies are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these therapies improved people's quality of life, their feelings (such as anxiety and depression), and how serious their IBD symptoms were (known as 'disease activity').\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological therapies with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). These studies compared psychological therapies to usual care or no therapy.\n\nFor adults, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, education, and relaxation techniques) probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological therapies may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n\nHow certain is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate for a few reasons. In many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced their reporting of symptoms. The studies also used different types of therapies and some were very small, which makes the results less certain.\n\nThe evidence in this review is up to date to May 2023."
