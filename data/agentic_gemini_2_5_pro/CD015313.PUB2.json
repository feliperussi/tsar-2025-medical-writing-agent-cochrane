    "output": "Are mucolytics (medicines that thin mucus) helpful for children with long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether using a salt-water mist (nebulised hypertonic saline) helps children with a specific long-term lung condition (bronchiectasis) by reducing flare-ups (exacerbations) or improving how well their lungs work. Information about unwanted effects was limited, but the study authors reported that no children left the study because of them.\n- We need more and better-designed studies to find out if different types of mucus-thinning medicines are helpful and safe for children with various long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough. The review found no studies on medicines taken by mouth or on children with other similar lung conditions.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children?\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a term for a group of lung conditions in children, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis. In children with these conditions, their airways repeatedly become infected and swell, which causes a long-lasting wet cough. Mucolytics are medicines that aim to break this cycle by helping to clear the sticky mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with CSLD. We were interested in whether these medicines could reduce the number of flare-ups (exacerbations), improve children's quality of life and other health outcomes, and whether they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared mucolytics (medicines that help clear mucus) with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included one study with 52 children who had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children's average age was around 9 years. The 8-week study compared nebulised 3% hypertonic saline (a salt-water mist) given before chest physiotherapy to chest physiotherapy alone. Because this study was small and had a high risk of bias, it is unclear if regularly using nebulised hypertonic saline has an effect on lung disease flare-ups or lung function. The study did not measure the children's quality of life. Information on unwanted effects was limited, but the study authors reported that no children left the study because of them. Our review did not find any studies that looked at using mucolytics during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other types of inhaled mucolytics, or their use in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. Our findings are based on a single small study, which we judged to have a high risk of bias. This was because people may have known which treatment they received, some data was missing, and the researchers did not report all the outcomes they had planned to. Because the single study only looked at one type of salt-water mist for children with bronchiectasis, the evidence does not tell us about other treatments (like medicines taken by mouth) or other related lung conditions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to September 2024."
