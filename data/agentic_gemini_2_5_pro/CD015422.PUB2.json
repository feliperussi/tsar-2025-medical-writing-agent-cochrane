    "output": "Can topical repellents (insect repellents applied to the skin) prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain if applying insect repellents to the skin prevents malaria, especially when other protective measures (such as insecticide-treated nets) are used. The repellents appeared to be safe, with only rare and mild skin reactions reported.\n- Insect repellents applied to the skin might slightly reduce malaria cases in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who may not have access to other ways to prevent malaria.\n- Better studies are needed to find out if skin repellents provide personal protection against malaria, particularly for high-risk groups like refugees who may not have access to other prevention methods.\n\nWhy look for new ways to prevent malaria?\nMalaria is a serious illness spread by mosquito bites. To prevent malaria, people most commonly use bed nets treated with an insect-killing spray (insecticide). They also spray insecticide on the inside walls of their homes. However, these methods mainly protect people when they are indoors and sleeping. They do not protect people who are outdoors, especially in the evening or early morning when mosquitoes are active. Some groups, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work in forests, may be at higher risk and may not be able to use nets or sprayed homes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents (creams or sprays applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away) helps prevent people from getting malaria in areas where the disease is common. We looked at whether using repellents on their own or with other ways to prevent malaria (like insecticide-treated nets) reduced the number of new malaria cases. We were also interested in how repellents affected different groups of people, including those at high risk of infection.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested if topical repellents prevent malaria. We compared and combined the results of the studies. We then used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 61,651 people. The studies focused on these high-risk groups as well as other people living in areas where malaria is common. 2 of the studies took place in refugee camps.\n\nWe looked at studies where people used topical repellents either on their own or with other ways to prevent malaria, like insecticide-treated nets. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of new malaria cases. They may also reduce the number of people who have malaria at any given time.\n\nThis effect was mainly seen in high-risk groups, like refugees, who might not have other ways to prevent malaria. There is not enough evidence to know if topical repellents are helpful in places where other ways to prevent malaria, like insecticide-treated nets, are already being used. Topical repellents appear to be safe, as very few users reported mild skin reactions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. In some studies, participants knew they were using a repellent. For example, if people knew they were using a real repellent, they might have acted differently or were less likely to report mosquito bites. This could have affected the study's results. Also, not all studies provided the data we were looking for.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to January 2023."
