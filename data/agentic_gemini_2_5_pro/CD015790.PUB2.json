    "output": "Can programs designed to help adults manage their vision loss improve their quality of life?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on weak evidence, programs to help adults manage their vision loss may have little to no effect on their quality of life (a person's overall well-being). These programs also appear to have little to no effect on the risk of unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Future research is needed to find better ways to measure quality of life and to see if these programs could help a wider range of people, such as those at different stages of vision loss or people who also have hearing loss.\n\nWhat is visual impairment and how can self-management help?\nVisual impairment is a common health problem that affects more than 2 billion people worldwide, particularly older adults. Losing vision can make daily tasks more difficult and can lead to a decline in a person's physical and mental well-being. Self-management programs are designed to help people with visual impairment by teaching them skills to manage their condition, stay independent in their daily activities, and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs improve the quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared these programs to either usual care or no specific program (such as being on a waiting list).\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program for adults with visual impairment. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies with 3151 participants. The studies took place in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America in settings like hospitals, low-vision clinics, and rehabilitation centers. Participants were older adults, with average ages from 60 to 84 years. In most studies, the main cause of low vision was age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease that can blur central vision). The diverse self-management programs taught people skills to manage their condition and stay independent. We compared these programs to usual care, getting optical aids, other low-vision support, or being on a waiting list. For adults with visual impairment, self-management programs may make little to no difference to their quality of life, both in general and related to their vision. These programs may also make little to no difference to the risk of unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Second, the support programs in the studies were very different from each other. This makes it hard to know which parts of the programs might be most helpful.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024."
