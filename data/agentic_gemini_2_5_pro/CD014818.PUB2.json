    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of different nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Different types of nerve blocks likely provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery.\n– The studies that looked for harmful effects did not report any.\n– We need larger studies to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these different nerve blocks.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow is pain managed after breast cancer surgery?\nPain after breast cancer surgery is a common and important concern. One way to manage this pain is with 'regional analgesia'. This involves injecting numbing medicine near specific nerves in the chest to block pain from the surgery site. These injections are often called 'nerve blocks'. Doctors can use several different types of nerve blocks, but they may also carry risks of unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits (pain reduction) and harms (complications or unwanted side effects) of different types of nerve blocks for women having breast cancer surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of different types of nerve blocks for managing pain after breast cancer surgery. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 39 studies that included a total of 2348 women having breast cancer surgery. Researchers conducted the studies in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. These trials compared various nerve blocks: paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block. This review did not receive any specific funding.\n\nWe found that the different types of nerve blocks seem to provide similar pain relief after the operation.\n– Pain at rest: The different nerve blocks made little to no difference in pain levels during the first day after surgery when compared to a common type of nerve block (paravertebral block).\n– Pain during movement: One type of block (pectoral nerve block) may slightly reduce pain 2 hours after surgery compared to the paravertebral block. Other comparisons showed little to no difference.\n– Harmful effects: The studies did not report any complications, so we do not know if the risk of harm differs between the blocks.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have only moderate confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies were small, and we did not have enough studies to be certain about all the results. The studies also used different methods to give the nerve blocks, which makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
