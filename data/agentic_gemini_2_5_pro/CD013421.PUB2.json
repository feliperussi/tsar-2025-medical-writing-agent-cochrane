    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined may help stop the bleeding faster. However, it is not clear if using sealants makes the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed, changes how much blood is lost, how long the operation takes, or if another surgery is needed to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. Researchers followed people for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The studies did not report where they took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. However, it is unclear if using sealants makes the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– how much blood is lost during surgery\n– how long the surgery takes\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, people and researchers in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Second, the studies included people having different types of surgery, which makes the results harder to combine. Third, some findings are based on a small number of people, which makes them less certain. Finally, we think that studies showing a benefit were more likely to be published. This could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
