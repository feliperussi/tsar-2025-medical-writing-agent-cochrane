    "output": "For people with acute heart failure, is it better to give diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip or as single, quick injections?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\n- For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the condition), there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if giving diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip is better or worse than giving them as single, quick injections. The review found that the two methods may have similar effects on survival, readmission to the hospital, and the risk of kidney problems. It is uncertain how they affect how long people stay in the hospital.\n- Because the available studies were small and had some limitations, larger and better-designed studies are needed to help doctors and patients understand if one way of giving these medicines is safer or more effective than the other.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it treated?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. 'Acute heart failure' is when symptoms of heart failure appear suddenly or get worse quickly. This often leads to a build-up of excess fluid in the body, causing swelling and making it hard to breathe. People with acute heart failure are usually treated in the hospital with medicines called 'loop diuretics' (often known as 'water pills'). These medicines are given directly into a vein to help the body get rid of the extra fluid quickly.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nLoop diuretics can be given into a vein in two ways: as a slow and steady drip over a period of time (a 'continuous infusion'), or as single, larger doses at set times (a 'bolus injection'). The review authors wanted to find out if one of these methods is better or safer than the other for treating adults with acute heart failure.\n\nMETHODS\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving diuretics as a continuous drip with giving them as separate injections in adults with acute heart failure.\n\nHow did we combine the results?\nWe collected and combined the results from all the studies to look for overall patterns.\n\nHow did we rate our confidence in the evidence?\nWe used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that included 681 people with acute heart failure. These studies took place in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, and collected data for periods ranging from 8 months to 6 years. The studies compared the two methods, but for adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show if one is better or worse than the other. When comparing the two methods, the review found that a continuous drip may make little to no difference to how many people die from any cause, how many people need to be readmitted to the hospital, or whether they developed a sudden kidney injury. We do not know if a continuous drip affects weight loss or how long people stay in the hospital because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence for a few reasons. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results. Also, in some studies, people and their doctors may have known which treatment they were receiving, which can influence the results. Finally, the studies included different groups of people, which makes it harder to combine their findings.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
