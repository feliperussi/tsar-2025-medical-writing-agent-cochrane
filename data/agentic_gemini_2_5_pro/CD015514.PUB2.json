    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people who have had surgery for a detached retina, the evidence about the benefits and harms of lying face-down is very uncertain. This position may reduce the risk of the retina moving out of place, developing wrinkles, or of seeing double. However, it may also increase the pressure inside the eye.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence about the effects of different positions after this type of eye surgery. Future research should also look at how positioning affects people's quality of life.\n\nWhat is a detached retina and how is it treated?\nA detached retina is a serious eye problem where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away from its normal position. When this involves the central part of the retina (the macula), it is a medical emergency that can cause severe vision loss. A common treatment is a type of surgery (called a vitrectomy) where a gas bubble is placed in the eye to push the retina back into place so it can heal. After surgery, some eye doctors suggest that people hold their head in a face-down position. The idea is that this helps the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina. This can prevent the retina from healing in the wrong spot, which is called retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause distorted vision (where straight lines look wavy) and double vision.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if lying with your head face-down after surgery for a detached retina reduces the risk of the retina moving out of place.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different treatment groups by chance. These studies compared lying face-down with other positions after surgery for a detached retina. We then combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 3 studies with 368 people who had surgery for a detached retina involving the macula (the central part of the retina). The studies compared different head positions after surgery, such as lying face-down versus a 'support-the-break' position (another head position to help the tear in the retina heal).\n\nLying face-down right after surgery may reduce the chance of the retina moving out of place, developing folds, or causing double vision when compared to a 'support-the-break' position. However, it may also increase the chance of high pressure inside the eye. Lying face-down may have little to no effect on vision, distorted vision, or quality of life. We are very uncertain about all these results.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. The studies were very small, and there are not enough of them to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to November 2022."
