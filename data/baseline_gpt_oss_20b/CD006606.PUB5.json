    "output": "## What is the problem?\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that can make it hard for a woman to get pregnant. Many women with PCOS turn to assisted‑reproduction techniques. The most common method is in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF), where the ovaries are stimulated with medicines to produce many eggs. A newer approach is in‑vitro maturation (IVM), where eggs are collected while still immature and then matured in the laboratory. IVM could be gentler because it uses less medication, but we need to know whether it works as well as IVF and whether it is safe.\n\n## What did we want to find out?\nWe set out to compare IVM with conventional IVF for women with PCOS. Specifically we wanted to know if IVM changes the chances of having a baby, the risk of miscarriage, the chance of becoming pregnant with a detectable heartbeat, the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), the chance of a baby being born early, and the chance of birth defects.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe looked for all randomised trials that compared IVM with IVF in women with PCOS. We found four studies that together included about eight hundred women. Two of the studies were recent and had good methods, while the other two were older and had some problems that could affect the results. We examined the reported outcomes and judged how much confidence we could have in each finding based on how the studies were done and how consistent the results were.\n\n## What did we find?\n### Live birth\nWe do not know if IVM changes the chance of having a baby compared with IVF. The evidence is very limited and the studies were small, so we are very uncertain about any effect.\n\n### Miscarriage\nWe are confident that IVM increases the chance of miscarriage after a pregnancy is confirmed. The studies consistently showed more miscarriages with IVM than with IVF.\n\n### Clinical pregnancy (heartbeat detected)\nWe do not know if IVM changes the chance of becoming pregnant with a detectable heartbeat compared with IVF. The evidence is very limited, so we are very uncertain.\n\n### Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nWe are confident that IVM greatly reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS compared with IVF. All studies showed far fewer cases of OHSS with IVM.\n\n### Preterm birth (baby born early)\nIVM probably makes little or no difference to the chance of a baby being born early compared with IVF. The studies showed a small effect that was not clearly in either direction.\n\n### Birth defects (congenital anomalies)\nWe are uncertain whether IVM changes the risk of birth defects compared with IVF. The evidence is limited and the studies were not large enough to give a clear answer.\n\nWe did not find any data on cycle cancellation, fertilisation rates, or on how the results might differ for specific groups of women.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main problems are that only a few studies have been done and many of them involved relatively few participants. Some of the older studies had design issues that could influence the results. Because of these limitations, we have high confidence only for the finding about reduced OHSS and increased miscarriage. For the other outcomes, especially live birth and pregnancy rates, we have little confidence and the results could change if larger, better‑designed studies are performed.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes studies published up to February 2023.\n\n## Key messages\n- IVM appears to greatly lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but may increase the chance of miscarriage compared with conventional IVF.\n- We are very uncertain whether IVM changes the chances of having a baby, becoming pregnant, having a baby born early, or having a baby with birth defects.\n- More large, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether IVM is a safe and effective alternative to IVF for women with PCOS."
