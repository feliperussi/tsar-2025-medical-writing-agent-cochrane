    "output": "Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for spinal anaesthesia in adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- Ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to see the spine) can help doctors find the right spot for spinal anaesthesia with fewer attempts and in less time. It also probably makes it more likely that the first try works.\n- We are not sure if ultrasound changes how much pain people feel during the procedure or if it causes more side effects. It probably does not change how satisfied people feel or how often the procedure fails.\n- More research is needed to confirm these findings and to see if the benefits are worth the extra equipment and training.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a way of putting medicine into the space around the spinal cord so that a person does not feel pain during surgery or childbirth. The medicine is given through a needle that must go into a very small space in the back.\n\nWhy is it important to get it right?\nGetting the needle in the right spot is tricky. If the needle misses, doctors may have to try again, which can cause more pain, longer waiting times, and a higher chance of complications. A successful first attempt is better for both the patient and the doctor.\n\nWhat is ultrasound guidance?\nUltrasound guidance uses a small device that sends sound waves into the back and creates a picture of the spine on a screen. This picture helps the doctor see the exact place where the needle should go, rather than relying only on feeling the bones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using ultrasound to guide the needle makes the procedure easier, faster, or safer compared with the usual method of feeling for the right spot using anatomical landmarks.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe looked for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for the right spot. In those studies, participants were randomly assigned to one method or the other. We combined the results and judged how confident we were in the overall picture.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 65 studies that together included more than 6,800 adults who needed spinal anaesthesia. The studies were done in many countries and covered a range of surgeries, including deliveries, joint replacements, and other operations.\n\nMain findings\n- Using ultrasound usually meant that doctors needed fewer needle attempts to reach the correct spot.\n- The time taken to complete the procedure was generally shorter when ultrasound was used.\n- It was more likely that the first attempt succeeded with ultrasound guidance.\n- There was little to no difference in how satisfied patients felt about the procedure or in the number of times the procedure failed completely.\n- We do not have clear evidence about whether ultrasound changes the amount of pain people feel during the needle insertion or whether it leads to more or fewer side‑effects such as low blood pressure or headache.\n\nLimitations and confidence in the evidence\nWe are confident that ultrasound reduces the number of attempts and shortens the procedure time because many studies showed the same direction of effect and the studies were generally well carried out. We are moderately confident that ultrasound increases the chance of a successful first attempt, although some studies measured this in slightly different ways. We have little confidence about the effect on patient satisfaction and technical failure because the results varied and some studies were small. We are not confident about the impact on pain during the procedure or on side‑effects because only a few studies looked at these outcomes and they used different methods to measure them.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023."
