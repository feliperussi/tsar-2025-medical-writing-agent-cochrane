    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for painful menstrual cramps?\n\nKey messages\n- We are confident that OCPs reduce pain from menstrual cramps more than no treatment, but they can cause irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n- The evidence is less certain about how OCPs compare to pain‑killer medicines and about long‑term safety.\n- Future research should look at long‑term safety and compare OCPs with pain‑killer medicines.\n\nWhat is painful menstrual cramps?\nPainful menstrual cramps, also called primary dysmenorrhoea, are sharp pains in the lower belly that start when a period begins. The pain is not caused by any disease inside the pelvis.\n\nWhy do people use birth control pills for cramps?\nCombined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are birth control pills that contain estrogen and progestin. Doctors also prescribe them because the hormones can calm the uterus and lessen the cramps.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether OCPs help with menstrual pain and what side effects they might cause.\n\nHow is painful menstrual cramps treated?\n- Birth control pills (OCPs)\n- Pain‑killer medicines such as NSAIDs\n- Other medicines or non‑medicine methods that were not covered in this review\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared OCPs with other OCPs, with no treatment, or with pain‑killer medicines. We combined the results and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that together included 3,723 women. The studies were done in many countries, lasted from a few months to a year, and mostly involved women in their teens to thirties.\n\nBenefits\n- OCPs reduce pain from menstrual cramps more than no treatment. The improvement is moderate and we are confident about this result.\n- When OCPs are taken continuously (without a break) they may reduce pain a little more than the standard month‑on, month‑off schedule, but the evidence is limited.\n\nHarms\n- OCPs increase the chance of irregular bleeding. This finding is supported by high‑quality evidence.\n- OCPs probably increase the chance of headaches and nausea. The evidence for these side effects is moderate.\n- OCPs may increase the chance of any side effect overall, and may increase the chance of serious side effects, but the confidence in these findings is low because few serious events were reported.\n- We are uncertain whether OCPs cause weight gain; the evidence is low‑certainty.\n- OCPs may slightly reduce the need for extra pain‑killer medicines and may slightly reduce days missed from work or school, but the confidence in these outcomes is low.\n- There is not enough information to say whether OCPs are better or worse than NSAID pain‑killers for relieving cramps.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n- We are confident about pain reduction and irregular bleeding because the studies were well designed, had many participants, and gave similar results.\n- We are moderately confident about headaches, nausea, and overall side effects because some studies were smaller or had slightly different methods.\n- We have low confidence about serious side effects, weight gain, need for extra medicines, and days missed from work because only a few studies looked at these outcomes and the numbers were small.\n- We are not confident about how OCPs compare to NSAID pain‑killers because only one small study made that comparison.\n- Overall, the evidence may not apply to women who are older, who have other health conditions, or who use different types of OCPs that were not studied.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe literature search was completed on 28 March 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
