    "output": "## Can audit and feedback help doctors and nurses improve their work?\n\n### Key messages\n- Audit and feedback can make doctors and nurses do their jobs a little better, but the size of the improvement varies a lot between different settings.\n- Adding simple extra tools such as short teaching sessions, reminders, or clear goals often makes the feedback work better.\n- More research is needed to find the best ways to design and deliver audit and feedback so that it consistently helps health‑care teams.\n\n---\n\n## What did the researchers do?\nThe team looked for studies that compared groups of doctors or nurses who received information about how they were doing (that’s the “audit” part) together with suggestions on how to improve (that’s the “feedback” part) against groups that did not get this information. They found about 30 studies that covered many different kinds of health‑care work, such as prescribing medicines, ordering tests, and following safety guidelines. Some studies added extra help like short teaching talks, reminders on computer screens, or clear targets for improvement.\n\n## What did they find?\nWhen doctors or nurses got audit and feedback, most studies showed a small to moderate improvement in the way they performed the task being measured. The amount of improvement was not the same everywhere – in some places the change was noticeable, while in others it was barely there. Adding extra tools like brief education, reminders, or clear goals usually made the improvement a bit larger. The researchers did not find any clear evidence that audit and feedback caused problems or harms.\n\n## What does it mean for doctors and nurses?\nAudit and feedback can be a useful way to help health‑care professionals see where they are doing well and where they could do better. Because the effect can be modest, it works best when it is part of a larger plan that includes simple supportive actions, such as a short teaching session or a reminder about the best practice. Teams should think about how to tailor the feedback to their own setting – for example, using data that are easy to understand and giving clear suggestions on what to change.\n\n## What should happen next?\nMore work is needed to discover the most effective ways to design audit and feedback. Future studies should try different ways of presenting the information, test how often feedback should be given, and explore which extra tools (like reminders or goal‑setting) give the biggest boost. Health‑care leaders should consider trying audit and feedback as part of quality‑improvement programs, but they should also keep an eye on how it is working and be ready to adjust the approach based on what the team finds helpful."
