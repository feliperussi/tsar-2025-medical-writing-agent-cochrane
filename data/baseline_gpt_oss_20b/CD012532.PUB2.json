    "output": "Title: What do anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 medicines do for people with glioma?\n\nKey messages:\n- The medicines that block PD‑1 or PD‑L1 do not appear to help people live longer or keep their tumours from growing.\n- We are not sure whether these medicines cause more or fewer side‑effects, and we do not know if they improve quality of life.\n- More research is needed before these medicines can be recommended for glioma.\n\nBackground:\nWhat is glioma and why is it a problem?\nGlioma is a type of brain tumour that can be very aggressive. It can cause headaches, seizures, and problems with thinking or movement. Treating glioma is difficult because the tumour often comes back after surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.\n\nWhat are anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 medicines?\nAnti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 medicines are a kind of immunotherapy. They work by helping the body’s own immune system recognise and attack cancer cells. They have been useful for some other cancers, so researchers wanted to see if they could help people with glioma.\n\nAims:\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these medicines, used alone or together with other treatments, improve survival, slow tumour growth, improve quality of life, or change the chance of side‑effects for people with glioma.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for studies that tested anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 medicines in people with glioma. We looked at randomised trials that compared these medicines with other treatments or with no treatment. We checked how the studies were done and how reliable they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics:\nWe found 13 trials that included about 2,000 participants. The trials tested different medicines (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab) and used them in various ways – sometimes before surgery, sometimes after, and sometimes together with radiation, chemotherapy, or another drug called bevacizumab. Most trials were small and many had problems with how they were carried out, which makes the results less certain.\n\nMain results:\nOverall survival: The evidence suggests that anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 medicines probably do not increase how long people live.\nProgression‑free survival (time before the tumour gets bigger): The medicines probably do not increase the time before the tumour grows.\nTumour response (how much the tumour shrinks): The medicines probably do not increase the chance that the tumour shrinks.\nSerious side‑effects: We are very uncertain about whether these medicines cause more serious side‑effects.\nLess serious side‑effects: The medicines may not increase less serious side‑effects.\nQuality of life: The evidence is very uncertain about any effect on quality of life.\n\nWe also looked at specific situations. Adding anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 medicines to radiation, to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide, or to bevacizumab did not show clear benefits. Using the medicines before and after surgery, or giving them together with another immunotherapy, also did not show clear benefits. In a few small studies there were hints of possible benefit, but the evidence was very uncertain because the studies were tiny and had high risk of bias.\n\nLimitations:\nWhy are we not more confident?\nMany of the trials were small and some did not follow the best methods, which means the results could be affected by chance or by how the study was run. The participants and the treatments varied a lot between studies, making it hard to combine the results. Because of these problems, we have limited confidence in the overall findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to 8 March 2024. No earlier systematic review on this exact question was found, so this summary reflects the most recent evidence available.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\nBased on the current evidence, anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 medicines do not appear to provide a clear benefit for people with glioma, and we are uncertain about their safety and impact on quality of life. More well‑designed, larger studies are needed before these medicines can be recommended as a standard treatment for glioma."
