    "output": "## Title\nDo different regional pain‑blocking techniques work the same after breast cancer surgery?\n\n## Key messages\n- All four techniques – paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block – provide similar relief of pain after breast cancer surgery, with any differences being small enough that most patients would not notice them.\n- No serious complications such as nerve injury or bleeding were reported for any of the techniques, suggesting that the risk of harm is very low.\n- Because the studies were generally small and sometimes gave inconsistent results, we are not very confident about the exact size of the benefit or the safety of each technique. More research is needed.\n\n## Introduction\n### What is breast cancer surgery pain and why does it matter?\nPain after breast cancer surgery can be intense and may interfere with recovery, daily activities, and quality of life. Managing this pain well is important for helping patients heal quickly and feel comfortable.\n\n### What are regional pain‑blocking techniques?\nRegional blocks are injections of long‑acting anaesthetic near nerves that supply the breast area. They are performed under ultrasound guidance while the patient is under general anaesthesia. The four main types studied are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB)\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB)\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC)\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB)\nThese blocks aim to numb the surgical area and reduce the need for opioid pain medicines.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe set out to compare how well each block reduces pain at rest and during movement after surgery, and whether any of them cause more complications.\n\n## How is breast cancer surgery pain treated?\nIn addition to the regional blocks, patients usually receive general anaesthesia during the operation and may be given opioid or non‑opioid pain medicines afterwards. The regional blocks are intended to lessen the amount of additional medication needed.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe looked for recent clinical trials that compared any of the four blocks with each other or with a placebo. We included studies that used ultrasound‑guided injections of long‑acting anaesthetic and that reported the patients’ own ratings of pain.\n\n## What did we find?\n### Study characteristics\nWe identified several trials involving thousands of participants from many countries. Most surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia and involved removal of breast tissue and nearby lymph nodes. The blocks were given as a single injection before the operation.\n\n### Main results\n- **We are confident that the pectoral nerve block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block when patients are at rest two hours after surgery.** The difference is smaller than what most people would notice.\n- **We are confident that the erector spinae plane block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block at rest two hours after surgery.** Again, the change is modest.\n- **We are moderately confident that the serratus anterior plane block may reduce pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block at rest two hours after surgery.** The evidence is a bit less certain.\n- **We have little confidence that the pectoral nerve block may reduce pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block during movement two hours after surgery.** The data are limited and inconsistent.\n- **We have little confidence that the erector spinae plane block may reduce pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block during movement two hours after surgery.**\n- **We are confident that the pectoral nerve block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block at rest twenty‑four hours after surgery.**\n- **We are confident that the erector spinae plane block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block at rest twenty‑four hours after surgery.**\n- **We are confident that the serratus anterior plane block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block at rest twenty‑four hours after surgery.**\n- **We are moderately confident that the erector spinae plane block may reduce pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block during movement twenty‑four hours after surgery.**\n- **We have little confidence that the pectoral nerve block may reduce pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block during movement twenty‑four hours after surgery.**\n- **We are not confident that the serratus anterior plane block may reduce pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block during movement twenty‑four hours after surgery.**\n- **We are not confident that the paravertebral block and erector spinae plane block make little or no difference in pain at rest forty‑eight hours after surgery.** The evidence is very limited.\n- **We are not confident that the erector spinae plane block may make little or no difference compared with the paravertebral block during movement forty‑eight hours after surgery.**\n- **We are not confident that the pectoral nerve block may make little or no difference compared with the paravertebral block during movement forty‑eight hours after surgery.**\n- **Complications:** No serious complications such as nerve injury, bleeding, or infection were reported for any of the techniques. Because no events occurred, we cannot say that one block is safer than another, but the available data suggest a very low risk of harm.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe trials were often small and sometimes used different doses or types of anaesthetic, which makes it hard to be sure about the exact benefit. Some studies did not report all outcomes clearly, and a few were stopped early, which can bias the results. Because of these issues, our confidence in the precise size of the pain‑relieving effect varies from high to very low.\n\n## How up to p date is this evidence?\nThe latest studies included were published in 2023, so the review reflects the most recent research up to that year."
