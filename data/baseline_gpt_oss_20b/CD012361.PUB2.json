    "output": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and calming in newborn babies on breathing machines?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no evidence that dexmedetomidine works or is safe for newborn babies on breathing machines. No studies met our criteria.\n- Some new studies are underway that may give us more information in the future.\n- More research is needed to know if dexmedetomidine can be used safely and effectively for these babies.\n\nWhat is dexmedetomidine and why is it used?\nDexmedetomidine is a medicine that helps calm people and reduces pain. It is thought to be gentler on the heart and blood pressure than stronger pain medicines like morphine. Doctors are using it more in children and babies, even though it is not officially approved for pain relief in this age group.\n\nWhy do newborn babies need sedation and pain relief while on breathing machines?\nNewborn babies who need help breathing with a machine often feel pain and stress. Calm and pain relief help them stay still, make breathing easier, and may improve their recovery. The medicines used for this purpose can sometimes affect the baby’s heart, breathing, or long‑term development.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether dexmedetomidine is a good and safe choice for calming and pain relief in newborn babies who are on breathing machines. We also wanted to see if it has any side effects or long‑term problems.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines, non‑pain medicines, or no medicine for babies on breathing machines. We then looked at the results of those studies and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe did not find any studies that met our criteria. Four studies are still being carried out. Two of them will compare dexmedetomidine with a strong pain medicine called fentanyl in babies who need surgery. The other two studies are still being checked. One study will compare dexmedetomidine with morphine in babies who have had a lack of oxygen and are being cooled to protect their brain. The last study will look at dexmedetomidine alone or with another medicine called ketamine for babies having heart scans. These studies may give us useful information once they finish.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have no evidence to support the use of dexmedetomidine for babies on breathing machines. The studies that are still in progress are small and may not give clear answers. Because of this, we cannot say whether the medicine is helpful or safe.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
