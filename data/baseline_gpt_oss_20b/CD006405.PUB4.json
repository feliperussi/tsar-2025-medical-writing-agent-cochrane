    "output": "Title: Does using a heated humidifier with a nasal cannula improve outcomes for very preterm infants?\n\nKey messages:\n- Adding a heated humidifier to nasal cannula breathing support probably reduces the chance of needing a breathing tube later.\n- It may also lower the risk of serious brain bleeding, but the evidence is not strong.\n- For other outcomes, such as death, infection, or lung problems, there is no clear benefit or harm.\n\nWhat is the problem we are trying to solve?\nWe want to know if giving very small babies warm, moist air through a tiny tube in the nose helps them stay healthier compared to giving them dry air through the same tube.\n\nWhy does this matter?\nVery preterm infants often need help breathing, and the way we give that help could affect how well they grow and avoid complications.\n\nHow will we find the answer?\nWe looked for studies that compared a heated humidifier plus nasal cannula with a regular nasal cannula that does not warm the air. We included research that measured important health outcomes for the babies.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for relevant studies, checked each one for quality, and pulled together the results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three studies that together included a few hundred very preterm infants. All of them compared a heated humidifier with a regular nasal cannula. The main findings were:\n- Babies who received the heated humidifier were probably less likely to need a breathing tube later. We are fairly confident about this benefit.\n- There was probably a small reduction in serious brain bleeding, but we have little confidence in this result because the data were limited.\n- For death before leaving the hospital, there was no clear difference between the two groups. We are not confident that the heated humidifier changes this outcome.\n- The chance of developing a lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia was about the same with or without the heated humidifier. The evidence does not point to a clear benefit.\n- Infections, including sepsis and infections of the blood, showed no obvious difference between the groups.\n- The need for a feeding tube placed through the nose or mouth was similar regardless of the humidifier.\n- The length of time the babies stayed in the intensive care unit and the total hospital stay were also about the same.\nOverall, the heated humidifier may help avoid later breathing tubes and could lower the risk of serious brain bleeding, but for most other health outcomes it does not appear to make a big difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies we found were small and sometimes did not follow the babies for a long time. Some outcomes were reported by only one study, making it hard to be sure about the results. The way the studies were done varied, and not all of them reported every outcome we were interested in. Because of these issues, we cannot be very sure about many of the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe newest study we included was published a few years ago, so the information reflects research up to that time."
