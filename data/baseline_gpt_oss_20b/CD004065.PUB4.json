    "output": "Are corticosteroids or biologics better for treating eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nKey messages\n- Corticosteroids may give a small improvement in symptoms and a large improvement in the number of eosinophils in the esophagus, but the evidence is mixed for how well they change the look of the esophagus and for side‑effect risks.\n- Biologics may give a moderate improvement in symptoms and a large improvement in the number of eosinophils, but the evidence is uncertain about how they change the look of the esophagus and about side‑effect risks.\n- More research is needed to confirm how well these medicines work, how safe they are, and whether they help people feel better in the long term.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a condition where a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the food pipe. This can cause trouble swallowing, pain, and food getting stuck.\n\nWhat are the goals of treatment?\nThe main goals are to reduce the number of eosinophils, improve how the food pipe looks, ease symptoms, and keep people safe from side effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well two groups of medicines—corticosteroids and biologic drugs—work compared with doing nothing (placebo). We also wanted to see how safe they are.\n\nHow is eosinophilic esophagitis treated?\n- Corticosteroid pills or swallows (e.g., budesonide, fluticasone)\n- Biologic injections that target specific immune signals (e.g., dupilumab, benralizumab)\n- Dietary changes and other supportive care (not covered in this review)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked at 41 randomized trials that included 3,253 people with EoE, comparing corticosteroids or biologics with placebo.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics\nThe trials involved both children and adults, with most participants having active disease. The studies tested many different doses and lengths of treatment, but most lasted a few weeks to a few months.\n\nMain results\nCorticosteroids compared with placebo\n- Symptoms: Corticosteroids may lead to a small improvement in how people feel.\n- Eosinophil count: Corticosteroids cause a large reduction in the number of eosinophils in the esophagus.\n- Esophagus appearance: Corticosteroids may lead to little to no improvement in how the lining looks.\n- Side effects: Corticosteroids may lead to slightly fewer people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nBiologics compared with placebo\n- Symptoms: Biologics may lead to a small improvement in how people feel.\n- Symptoms (continuous measure): Biologics probably lead to a moderate improvement in symptom scores.\n- Eosinophil count: Biologics probably cause a large reduction in eosinophils.\n- Eosinophil count (continuous measure): Biologics may cause a large reduction in eosinophils, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n- Esophagus appearance: Biologics may lead to little to no improvement in how the lining looks.\n- Esophagus appearance (continuous measure): Biologics may cause a large improvement in appearance, but we are very uncertain.\n- Side effects: Biologics may lead to slightly more people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany of the studies were small and varied in how they measured outcomes, which makes it hard to be sure about the results. Some results are based on only a few participants, and the quality of the evidence ranges from low to very low for many outcomes. This means we cannot be very confident that the findings will apply to all people with EoE.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe studies we included were searched up to 3 March 2023, so the information reflects research available up to that date."
