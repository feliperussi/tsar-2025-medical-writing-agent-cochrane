    "output": "What are the strengths and limits of blood tests for detecting hidden vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey Messages\n- The tests we examined often miss people who truly lack vitamin A, but they are fairly good at confirming when someone is not deficient. Because the studies were not set up to test accuracy, we cannot be sure how well the tests work.\n- The evidence is limited and uncertain. We do not know how the tests perform in different groups, especially in people who actually have a deficiency.\n- More research is needed, especially studies that are designed specifically to see how accurate these tests are.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is essential for vision, immune function, and growth. When the body does not have enough, people can develop night blindness, increased risk of infection, and poor growth in children. In many parts of the world, the deficiency is not obvious and is called \"hidden\" or subclinical deficiency because people may not show clear symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well common blood‑based tests identify hidden vitamin A deficiency. The tests we looked at include measuring vitamin A directly in the blood (serum or plasma retinol), measuring a protein that carries vitamin A (retinol‑binding protein), a test that looks at how the body responds to a small dose of vitamin A (relative dose response), and measuring vitamin A in breast milk. We also considered a special laboratory method that uses a tiny amount of a labelled vitamin A to estimate total body stores.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies published up to 18 August 2022 that compared one of the above tests with a reference method that measures vitamin A stores in the liver or uses the labelled‑vitamin technique. We combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the findings based on how the studies were carried out and the amount of information available.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics\nWe identified 40 separate reports that together included about 5,000 participants of different ages and health backgrounds. No study was specifically designed to test how accurate the blood tests are; instead, the tests were used as part of other research. The reference methods used were either a direct measurement of liver vitamin A or the labelled‑vitamin technique.\nMain results\nWhen we looked at how often the tests correctly identified people who truly lacked vitamin A (the ability to catch a deficiency), the numbers were low, ranging from essentially none to about half of the deficient cases. In contrast, the ability of the tests to correctly say that a person was not deficient (the ability to avoid false alarms) was higher, usually between three‑quarters and nine‑tenths of the time. This pattern was seen for the direct blood vitamin A test, the protein‑binding test, and the response‑to‑dose test. The breast‑milk test and the labelled‑vitamin method showed similar trends but were based on fewer studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nStep 1 – Why the evidence is uncertain\nThe studies we found were not set up to measure how well the tests work, so the numbers may not reflect real‑world performance. Many studies included very few people who actually had a deficiency, making it hard to judge the test’s ability to detect deficiency. The participants came from a wide range of settings, and the reference methods themselves can vary, adding further uncertainty.\nStep 2 – What this means for you\nBecause of these issues, we cannot be confident that any of the blood tests will reliably find hidden vitamin A deficiency in all situations. A test that often misses deficiency could give a false sense of security, while a test that frequently gives a false alarm could lead to unnecessary treatment.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe literature search was completed on 18 August 2022, so the findings reflect studies published up to that date."
