    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of non‑immunosuppressive medicines for people with IgA kidney disease?\n\nKey messages\n- Medicines that lower blood pressure and block the renin‑angiotensin system probably reduce the amount of protein that leaks into the urine, but we do not know if they change the chance of kidney failure or death. No serious side effects were reported in the studies we examined.\n- Removing the tonsils may help some people stop having protein in the urine, but the evidence comes from a small number of studies done mainly in Japan, so we are not confident that the same benefit would be seen elsewhere.\n- For other medicines such as blood thinners, fish oil, herbal extracts, or antimalarial drugs the evidence is weak and we cannot tell whether they help or cause harm. More research that follows people for a long time is needed.\n\nWhat is IgA kidney disease?\nIgA kidney disease, also called IgA nephropathy, is a condition where a protein called immunoglobulin A builds up in the tiny filters of the kidneys. This can cause blood or protein to appear in the urine and may slowly reduce kidney function over many years.\n\nWhy is it important to find good treatments?\nBecause the disease can progress to kidney failure, finding medicines that slow the damage or reduce symptoms is crucial. At the same time, medicines can have side effects, so it is important to know which treatments are truly helpful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to learn whether medicines that do not suppress the immune system can improve kidney health, reduce protein in the urine, or affect the risk of kidney failure, the need for dialysis, heart problems, or death. We also wanted to know whether these medicines cause any important harms.\n\nHow is IgA kidney disease treated?\nDoctors often use medicines that control blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system, to protect the kidneys. Other options that have been tried include removing the tonsils, using blood thinners, fish oil supplements, certain herbal products, and antimalarial drugs. The choice of treatment depends on how much protein is in the urine, how fast the disease is progressing, and the person’s overall health.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for studies that compared non‑immunosuppressive medicines with no treatment or with other medicines, combined the results, and judged how reliable the evidence seemed.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 80 studies that together included about 4,800 people with IgA kidney disease. The studies varied in size and many did not clearly describe how participants were chosen or how outcomes were measured, which makes the overall picture less certain.\n\nFor medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system, most studies showed a likely reduction in urine protein. However, the studies did not give clear information about whether these medicines changed the risk of kidney failure, the need for dialysis, heart attacks, or death. No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nTonsil removal was studied in a few trials, mainly in Japan. These trials suggested that the surgery might increase the chance of stopping protein loss in the urine, but the small number of participants and the limited geographic setting mean we cannot be sure the benefit applies to other groups.\n\nBlood thinners, fish oil, herbal medicines, and antimalarial drugs were each examined in only a handful of small studies. The results were mixed and did not show a clear benefit or harm. Because the studies were short and involved few participants, we cannot draw firm conclusions about these treatments.\n\nOverall, the evidence points to a probable benefit of blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system in reducing urine protein, while the other treatments either have uncertain effects or lack enough data. More large, well‑designed studies that follow people for several years are needed to understand how these medicines affect kidney failure, heart health, and overall survival."
