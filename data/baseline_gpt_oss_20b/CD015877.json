    "output": "Is a personalised nutrition plan (precision nutrition) better than a one‑size‑fits‑all plan for children and teens with obesity?\n\nKey messages\n– We found very little evidence that a personalised nutrition plan changes weight or BMI in children or teens with obesity. The studies were small and the results are uncertain.\n– Because the evidence is limited, we cannot say whether the personalised plan is safer or causes any side effects.\n– More research is needed with larger studies that report on weight, health, and well‑being outcomes to know if personalised nutrition helps.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition?\nPrecision nutrition means tailoring a diet plan to each person’s unique characteristics. These characteristics can include a person’s genes, current eating habits, how their body reacts to food, their gut bacteria, their daily routine, their health status, and their social and emotional life. The idea is that a one‑size‑fits‑all diet may not work for everyone, so a personalised plan might be more effective.\n\nWhy is it important for children with obesity?\nObesity in children and teens can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and early heart disease. It can also affect a child’s mood, energy, and confidence. Finding a diet that works well for each child could help them lose weight, feel better, and stay healthy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether personalised nutrition plans help children and teens with overweight or obesity lose weight or keep their weight stable, and whether they improve physical or mental well‑being. We also wanted to see if the plans cause any unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared personalised nutrition plans with standard plans or no plan in children and teens with overweight or obesity. We summarised the results and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that met our criteria. One study was done in Ukraine and the other in Greece. Together they included 105 children and teens. The studies looked at children aged 0 to 9 years and those aged 10 to 19 years. One study reported that it was funded by a nonprofit organisation; the other did not say who funded it.\n\nMain results\nFor children 0 to 9 years old, the evidence is very uncertain about whether a personalised nutrition plan changes body mass index (BMI) or weight compared with a standard plan. For children and teens 10 to 19 years old, the evidence is also very uncertain about whether a personalised nutrition plan changes BMI or weight compared with a standard plan. We do not know if the plans help or hurt because the studies were small and the results are unclear.\n\nWe have no information from these studies about mental or emotional well‑being, physical activity, or quality of life, so we cannot say whether the plans affect those areas.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because only two small studies were available. The small size of the studies means we cannot be sure that the results would be the same in other children or in larger groups. Because the studies were so few, we also cannot be sure about the safety or side effects of the personalised plans.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
