    "output": "Title: Which cycle plan works best for frozen embryo transfers?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not know if a natural cycle, a hormone‑treated cycle, or a cycle that uses a mild drug to trigger ovulation leads to more live births, fewer miscarriages, or different rates of multiple births.\n- The research that exists is limited and often uncertain, so any small differences that might exist are not clear.\n- More well‑designed studies are needed to find out which approach, if any, gives the best chances of a healthy pregnancy.\n\nWhat did we ask?\nWe wanted to find out whether the way a woman’s body is prepared for a frozen embryo transfer—using a natural cycle, a hormone‑treated cycle, or a cycle that includes a mild drug to trigger ovulation—changes the chances of having a baby, the risk of miscarriage, or the chance of having twins or more.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies that randomly assigned women to different preparation methods and that reported outcomes such as live birth, miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, and multiple pregnancy. We included studies that compared natural cycles with hormone‑treated cycles, hormone‑treated cycles with hormone‑treated cycles that also used a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), and natural cycles with modified natural cycles that used a mild drug to trigger ovulation. In total, the evidence came from many studies involving thousands of women.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics:\n- The studies were conducted in a variety of settings and used different hormone protocols, but all compared at least two of the preparation methods.\n- The quality of the evidence varied: some comparisons were supported by fairly reliable evidence, others by limited evidence, and a few by very uncertain evidence.\n\nMain results:\n- Comparing a natural cycle with a hormone‑treated cycle gave uncertain results for live birth, miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, and multiple pregnancy. The evidence was limited, so we cannot say whether one method is better.\n- When a hormone‑treated cycle was compared with the same cycle that also used a GnRHa, the evidence was fairly reliable for live birth and miscarriage, but still suggested little or no difference between the two approaches.\n- Comparing a natural cycle with a modified natural cycle that used a mild drug to trigger ovulation also produced uncertain results for all outcomes, with the evidence being limited.\n- Directly comparing a hormone‑treated cycle with a hormone‑treated cycle that used a GnRHa showed fairly reliable evidence that there is probably little or no difference in live birth, miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, and multiple pregnancy.\n- Overall, no harmful effects were reported for any of the preparation methods.\n\nLimitations:\n- Many of the studies had small numbers of participants or did not report all outcomes clearly, which reduces confidence in the findings.\n- Different hormone protocols and timing of embryo transfer were used, making it hard to combine results.\n- Some comparisons were based on very uncertain evidence, meaning the true effect could be quite different from what was observed.\n\nHow up to date is this?\nThe search covered studies published up to early 2024, so the summary reflects the most recent evidence available at the time of writing."
