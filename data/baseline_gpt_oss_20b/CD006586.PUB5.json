    "output": "What is premenstrual syndrome?\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of physical and emotional symptoms that many people experience in the week before their period. Symptoms can include mood swings, breast tenderness, bloating, and irritability. A more severe form, called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), involves stronger mood changes and can interfere with daily life.\n\nWhy is this important?\nPMS and PMDD affect a large number of people who menstruate, and the symptoms can reduce quality of life, work productivity, and social relationships. Finding safe and effective ways to relieve these symptoms is a priority for many health services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe asked whether a combined oral contraceptive (COC) that contains the progestin drospirenone and a low dose of the estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE) helps reduce PMS symptoms compared with a placebo. We also wanted to know whether this COC improves daily functioning, how many people feel better on the medication, and what side‑effects might occur.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for randomised trials that compared drospirenone‑EE with a placebo. We included studies that enrolled people with PMS or PMDD and that reported at least one of the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled about 800 people with PMS or PMDD. The studies were carried out in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe. All participants were of reproductive age and had regular menstrual cycles. The trials lasted for three menstrual cycles, and the COC was taken continuously. The studies were funded by a mix of public agencies and private organisations, but none of the reports gave detailed information about the source of funding. No trials compared drospirenone‑EE with other types of combined oral contraceptives.\n\nKey messages (2‑3 bullet points)\n- The drospirenone‑EE pill may reduce overall premenstrual symptoms, but the benefit is likely to be small to moderate.\n- The pill may slightly improve daily activities such as work, social life, and relationships.\n- The pill may increase the chance of side‑effects and of stopping the study because of those side‑effects.\n\nHow confident are we in these findings?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies did not always place people randomly into the treatment groups, which means differences between groups could be due to other factors. Some participants may have known which pill they were taking, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in. The results varied between the studies, and the total number of participants was relatively small, making it hard to be sure the findings apply to all people with PMS.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited in several ways. First, the way the studies were carried out was not always clear, so we cannot be sure that the groups were truly comparable. Second, the studies used slightly different methods and measured outcomes in different ways, which makes it difficult to combine the results. Third, the total number of people studied was modest, so the estimates of benefit and harm may be imprecise. Finally, we did not find any studies that compared this pill with other combined oral contraceptives, so we cannot say whether it is better or worse than other options.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe literature search covered studies published up to 29 June 2022. No newer trials were identified at the time of the review.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice and research?\nFor people with PMS or PMDD, the drospirenone‑EE pill might offer a modest reduction in symptoms and a small improvement in daily functioning, but it also appears to raise the likelihood of side‑effects and of stopping treatment because of those side‑effects. Health professionals should discuss these potential benefits and harms with patients and consider individual preferences. More research is needed to determine whether the pill works over longer periods, whether it helps people with milder symptoms, and how it compares with other combined oral contraceptives that contain different progestogens. Larger, well‑designed trials that report all relevant outcomes would help clarify these questions."
