    "output": "Does nebulised hypertonic saline reduce flare‑ups in children with chronic wet cough?\n\nKey Messages\n- The only study we found suggests that nebulised hypertonic saline might lower flare‑ups and improve breathing, but we are not confident because the study was small and had many problems.\n- No study measured how the treatment affects children’s daily life or looked at other mucolytic medicines, so we do not know if they help.\n- More well‑designed research is needed to confirm whether this treatment works and to check its safety.\n\nWhat is chronic wet cough?\nChildren with chronic wet cough have a cough that lasts for weeks and produces mucus. The condition can be caused by diseases such as bronchiectasis or protracted bacterial bronchitis. The mucus can block the airways, making breathing difficult and leading to sudden worsening of symptoms, called flare‑ups.\n\nWhy study mucolytics?\nMucolytics are medicines that thin mucus, helping the body clear it from the lungs. If they work, children might breathe easier and have fewer flare‑ups. Nebulised hypertonic saline is a type of mucolytic that can be inhaled before chest physiotherapy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether nebulised hypertonic saline reduces flare‑ups, improves lung function, and is safe for children with chronic wet cough.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies that compared nebulised hypertonic saline with no treatment or a placebo in children with chronic wet cough. We included randomised controlled trials and extracted the main results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified only one randomised trial that met our criteria. The trial enrolled 52 children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Children were randomly assigned to receive nebulised hypertonic saline before chest physiotherapy or to receive chest physiotherapy alone. Each treatment period lasted eight weeks.\n\nThe study reported that children who received hypertonic saline experienced fewer flare‑ups. On average, the treatment group had about 2.5 flare‑ups per child per year, while the control group had about 7.8 flare‑ups. The study also measured lung function. The percentage of normal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) increased by roughly 14% in the treatment group compared with a 5% increase in the control group. The forced vital capacity (FVC) improved by about 14% with hypertonic saline versus 8% with standard care.\n\nWe are not confident in these findings because the trial was small and had many problems that make the results uncertain. The researchers did not report on side‑effects or on how the children felt in daily life. Because only one small study was found, we cannot be sure that the same results would occur in other children or with other mucolytic medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the single study was small, had several design issues, and did not assess safety or quality‑of‑life outcomes. The lack of additional studies means we cannot confirm the findings or know whether they apply to other types of chronic wet cough.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe literature search covered studies published up to 27 September 2024, so the evidence reflects research available up to that date."
