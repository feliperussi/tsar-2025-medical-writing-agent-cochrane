    "output": "Does putting a drain in the belly after surgery for complicated appendicitis help prevent infections?\n\nKey messages\n- It is not clear whether a drain reduces belly infections after surgery for complicated appendicitis, and there is some suggestion that a drain could increase the chance of death, but we are not sure.\n- There is no clear evidence that a drain shortens the time spent in hospital or reduces other problems after surgery.\n- More well‑designed research is needed to find out if drains are helpful or harmful.\n\nWhat is the problem and why might a drain be used?\nComplicated appendicitis means the appendix is badly infected or has burst, spreading infection into the belly cavity. After the surgeon removes the appendix, fluid can collect in the belly and may become infected. Some surgeons place a thin tube, called a drain, into the belly to let fluid flow out, hoping this will keep the belly clean and stop infections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if using a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis lowers the risk of belly infections, wound infections, other complications, death, or a longer stay in hospital.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared putting a drain in the belly with not using a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found several studies that together included a few hundred people from different parts of the world. Most of the people had a burst appendix and were treated with antibiotics after surgery. The studies had many problems, such as small numbers of participants and differences in how they were carried out, which makes the overall picture uncertain.\n\nMain results\n- Belly infections: It is unclear if a drain reduces infections inside the belly after surgery.\n- Wound infections: It is unclear if a drain reduces infections at the cut site.\n- Other complications: It is unclear if a drain reduces other problems that can happen after surgery.\n- Death: The evidence suggests that a drain may increase the chance of death after surgery, but the certainty of this finding is limited.\n- Time in hospital: It is unclear if a drain changes how long people stay in the hospital after surgery.\nNo studies compared different types of drains (open versus closed) or looked at the best time to remove a drain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nThe studies we found were not well designed and often had small groups of participants. They also used different methods, which makes it hard to compare them. Because of these problems, we have little confidence that the results tell the full truth about the benefits or harms of drains.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates earlier work and includes all evidence that was available up to mid‑October 2023. It reflects the most recent research on this question."
