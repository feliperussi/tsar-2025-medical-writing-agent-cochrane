    "output": "Do antioxidants help people with oral submucous fibrosis open their mouths and reduce burning pain?\n\n- We are moderately confident that taking antioxidants can probably help people with oral submucous fibrosis open their mouths a little more and feel less burning pain.\n- We have little confidence that other treatments, such as steroids, physiotherapy or other medicines, make a clear difference.\n- More high‑quality studies are needed to confirm how safe these treatments are and whether they truly help.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long‑term disease of the mouth that makes the cheeks and jaw tighten. It can cause severe pain, make it hard to eat or speak, and may increase the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut, a plant that is often used in some cultures.\n\nWhy is it a problem?\n\nBecause OSF limits how wide a person can open their mouth, it can make eating, drinking and speaking difficult. The pain and stiffness can lower a person’s quality of life and make everyday tasks hard.\n\nWhat are common treatments?\n\nMost people with OSF try to stop chewing areca nut. Doctors may also give medicines, do surgery, or use other therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound. However, it is not clear which of these options works best.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to see whether any of the treatments for OSF actually help people open their mouths more, reduce pain, and improve daily life, and whether they cause any side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for OSF, combined their results, and judged how confident we could be in those results.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 30 studies that together involved 2,176 adults with OSF. Most studies were small and many had problems that could affect the results. The studies were carried out in many countries and used a variety of medicines, surgeries and other therapies.\n\nMain results\n\nAntioxidants\n\nWe are moderately confident that taking antioxidants can probably help people with OSF open their mouths a little more after a few months and can probably reduce the burning pain they feel. The improvement in mouth opening is small – only a few millimetres – but it is a measurable change.\n\nOther medicines and therapies\n\nFor treatments such as steroid injections, a drug called pentoxifylline, a mix of steroids and hyaluronidase, physiotherapy, or other medicines, we have little confidence that they make a clear difference. The evidence for these options is very uncertain.\n\nSurgery and other procedures\n\nThe studies that looked at surgery or other procedures compared to no active treatment also gave very uncertain results. We cannot say whether these options improve mouth opening, reduce pain, or affect quality of life.\n\nAdverse effects\n\nSome studies reported mild and temporary side effects such as stomach upset or skin irritation. One study mentioned a serious problem, but it was not clear how often this happened. Overall, we are not confident about the safety profile of many of the treatments.\n\nLimitations\n\nMany of the studies were small and had design problems that make us less sure about the results. Some studies did not hide the treatment from participants, which could influence how people reported their symptoms. Because of these issues, the overall confidence in the findings is limited.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nWe searched the literature up to 5 September 2022, and this review updates an earlier version that was published in 2008. The evidence reflects what was known up to that date."
