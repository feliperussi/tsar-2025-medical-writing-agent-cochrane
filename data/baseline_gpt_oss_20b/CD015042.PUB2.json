    "output": "Can brief talks help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol?\n\nKey Messages\n- Brief talks may help pregnant women stop drinking, but we are not sure how much they cut down the number of drinks or help women stay in treatment. No studies looked at medicines, and no safety data were reported.\n- More research is needed to see if medicines can help and to confirm the safety of talking‑based support.\n- Future studies should include larger groups, longer follow‑up, and clear ways to measure drinking and safety.\n\nWhat is alcohol use during pregnancy?\nAlcohol can cross the placenta and reach the baby. Even small amounts can affect the baby’s growth and brain development. Some pregnant women continue to drink, and the amount varies a lot between countries.\n\nWhy is it a problem?\nWhen a pregnant woman drinks, the baby may be born with physical or learning difficulties later in life. Stopping or reducing alcohol use is therefore very important for the health of both mother and child.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether talking‑based support (psychosocial interventions) or medicines can help pregnant women stop or cut back on drinking. We also wanted to see if these approaches keep women in treatment and whether they cause any side‑effects.\n\nHow is alcohol use during pregnancy treated?\n- Psychosocial interventions: short conversations, brief counseling sessions, or a few structured talks that aim to motivate change.\n- Medicines that help people stop drinking: none of the studies we found tested medicines in pregnant women.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared talking‑based support or medicines with usual care or other options. We combined the results and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: We found eight studies that together included 1,369 pregnant women from several countries. All studies tested talking‑based support that lasted from a single short session to a few brief sessions. The support was given at different times during pregnancy, and the women were followed up for a few weeks to several months after the support ended. No study looked at medicines, and none reported any side‑effects.\nMain results:\n- Stopping drinking completely: The talking‑based support probably leads to a large increase in the number of women who stop drinking completely during pregnancy. However, the evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure how big the benefit really is.\n- Number of drinks per day: The support may have little to no effect on how many drinks a woman has each day, and we are very uncertain about this result.\n- Staying in treatment: The support probably makes little or no difference to whether women finish the treatment program they start.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence about stopping drinking because the studies were small and many participants knew whether they were getting the special talks or not, which can change how they behave. We are very uncertain about the effect on the number of drinks per day for the same reasons. For staying in treatment, the evidence is a bit stronger, but the studies still had some problems that make us cautious.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence was collected from studies published up to 8 January 2024."
