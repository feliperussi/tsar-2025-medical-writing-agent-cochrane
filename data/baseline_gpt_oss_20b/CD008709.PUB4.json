    "output": "## Are single‑incision sling operations as safe and effective as other treatments for urinary incontinence in women?\n\n### Key messages\n- Single‑incision slings probably help women stop leaking urine about as well as other common sling surgeries, but we are not sure about long‑term safety or pain after the operation.\n- There is not enough evidence to say whether single‑incision slings are better or worse than doing nothing, simple pelvic‑floor exercises, or other types of surgery.\n- More long‑term research is needed to understand how safe and effective single‑incision slings are over many years.\n\n### What is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means that a woman leaks urine when she coughs, laughs, or exercises. It can be embarrassing and affect daily life, work, and social activities. Many women look for treatments that can stop the leakage and improve quality of life.\n\n### What are single‑incision slings?\nA single‑incision sling is a thin piece of material that a surgeon places through a small cut in the vagina to support the urethra. The goal is to keep the urethra closed when pressure builds up, such as during a cough. The procedure is marketed as being quicker and causing less pain than older sling methods.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether single‑incision slings work as well as other surgical options, whether they are safe, and how they affect quality of life, pain, and the need for further surgery. We also looked for information on costs.\n\n### How is urinary incontinence treated?\n- **Lifestyle changes** – fluid management, weight control, and bladder training.\n- **Pelvic‑floor muscle exercises** – often called Kegel exercises.\n- **Medications** – to relax the bladder or tighten the urethra.\n- **Surgical options** – include various sling procedures, colposuspension, and laparoscopic techniques.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for studies published up to September 2022 that compared single‑incision slings with other treatments for women with stress urinary incontinence. We included randomised trials that reported how well the treatments worked, any side effects, and costs. Two reviewers checked each study for quality and extracted the data.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe identified 62 studies involving a total of about 8,000 women. No study compared single‑incision slings with doing nothing, simple exercises, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures, so we could not answer those questions.\n\n**How single‑incision slings compare with retropubic slings**\n- The evidence suggests there may be little to no difference in how many women feel cured or improved after 12 months.\n- We are uncertain whether single‑incision slings increase the chance of mesh problems such as exposure or erosion.\n- The chance of needing another continence operation or a mesh revision appears uncertain.\n- We do not know if single‑incision slings affect the risk of urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder).\n- There is little evidence about differences in pain after surgery.\n- Quality of life after 12 months may be lower with single‑incision slings, but the evidence is not strong.\n\n**How single‑incision slings compare with transobturator slings**\n- There is no clear difference in cure rates after 12 months.\n- Women with single‑incision slings may have a slightly higher chance of feeling pain after surgery, but the certainty is low.\n- The risk of mesh exposure or erosion is uncertain.\n- The need for repeat surgery is uncertain.\n- Quality of life after 12 months may be lower with single‑incision slings, but the evidence is not strong.\n- Pain after surgery may be higher with single‑incision slings, though we are not very confident about this.\n- The chance of urinary retention is uncertain.\n- The risk of dyspareunia (painful intercourse) is uncertain.\n\n**How single‑incision slings compare with autologous fascial slings**\n- We are uncertain whether single‑incision slings improve cure rates compared with fascial slings.\n- The risk of mesh exposure or erosion is uncertain.\n- The need for repeat surgery is uncertain.\n- Pain after surgery may be higher with single‑incision slings, but the evidence is not strong.\n- Quality of life after 12 months may be lower with single‑incision slings, though we are not confident.\n- The risk of urinary retention is uncertain.\n\n**Cost information**\nTwo studies looked at cost‑effectiveness and one at cost‑minimisation. The results were mixed, and we cannot say definitively whether single‑incision slings are cheaper or provide better value than other sling types.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\n- Many studies were small and had short follow‑up, so we do not know the long‑term safety of single‑incision slings.\n- The quality of the studies varied, and some did not report important outcomes such as pain, quality of life, or need for repeat surgery.\n- There were few direct comparisons with non‑surgical treatments, so we cannot answer whether surgery is better than simple exercises or other conservative approaches.\n- The evidence on adverse events such as mesh exposure, urinary retention, and painful intercourse is uncertain.\n- Cost data were limited and came from only a few health‑care settings.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe literature search covered studies published up to 20 September 2022. This means the review includes research from the past decade but does not contain any studies published after that date. Newer data may change the conclusions, especially regarding long‑term safety and cost.\n\nOverall, single‑incision slings appear to work about as well as other sling surgeries in the short term, but we need more high‑quality, long‑term research to be sure about safety, pain, quality of life, and cost."
