    "output": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (a group of long‑lasting conditions that cause inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the intestines)?\n\nKey messages\n- Psychological therapies such as counselling, education and relaxation probably give modest improvements in overall wellbeing (quality of life = how someone feels and the ability to do daily activities) and mood (lower depression and anxiety) for adults with IBD, and may also help children; they do not appear to change disease activity (how active the gut inflammation is), and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Programs that focus mainly on patient education or relaxation show similar small benefits for wellbeing and mood, but the impact on disease activity remains unclear.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to see whether these therapies can influence disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\nIBD includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. It causes swelling of the gut lining, leading to painful cramps, diarrhoea, bleeding, weight loss and the need for medicines, surgery or hospital stays. Living with IBD is stressful, and many people develop mental‑health problems such as depression or anxiety. Researchers think the relationship works both ways: stress can worsen gut inflammation, and inflammation can increase anxiety or low mood.\n\nWhy might psychological or mind‑body therapies be useful for people with IBD?\nPsychological therapies (treatments that work with the mind, thoughts and feelings) include counselling, education about the disease, relaxation exercises, or a mix of these. The idea is that helping people understand their illness, manage worries and learn relaxation techniques could improve quality of life, reduce depression and anxiety, and maybe calm gut inflammation.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?\nWe asked whether psychological therapies improve quality of life, lessen depression or anxiety, and affect disease activity in children, teenagers and adults compared with usual care or no therapy.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched electronic databases for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested psychological therapies in people with IBD and reported outcomes on quality of life, emotional state or disease activity.\n\nHow did we decide which studies to include?\nWe included trials that compared a psychological therapy with usual care or another control and measured at least one of the outcomes above.\n\nHow did we combine the data?\nTwo reviewers extracted data and pooled results using random‑effects meta‑analyses. We measured heterogeneity with the I² statistic.\n\nHow did we assess risk of bias?\nTwo reviewers independently applied the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, judging randomisation, blinding, incomplete data and selective reporting.\n\nHow did we grade the certainty of the evidence?\nWe used the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 eligible randomised controlled trials. Forty‑eight trials provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering 6,405 participants (6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All trials required at least two months of follow‑up. Interventions were diverse but most combined counselling, education and relaxation, either alone or together. Comparators were usual care, no therapy, sham interventions or other active treatments.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n- In adults, psychological therapy probably improves quality of life a little and probably reduces depression and anxiety a little.  \n- Educational programmes probably give a small improvement in quality of life and a small reduction in depression; they may lower anxiety slightly but probably do not change disease activity.  \n- Relaxation techniques probably boost quality of life and lower both depression and anxiety slightly; their effect on disease activity is unclear.  \n- In children and adolescents, psychotherapy (talk‑based therapy) probably improves quality of life, but we lack evidence on its impact on anxiety, depression or disease activity.  \nOverall, psychological therapies appear to have little or no effect on underlying disease activity, and the certainty of that finding is very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nParticipants often knew which treatment they received — this may introduce bias. The studies varied in who took part and how the therapies were delivered. Many trials were small, increasing imprecision.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
