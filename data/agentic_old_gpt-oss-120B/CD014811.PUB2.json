    "output": "Title: Is a steady drip (continuous infusion) of water‑pill diuretics (loop diuretics) more effective than a quick push (bolus injection) for treating sudden worsening of heart failure (acute heart failure)?\n\nKey messages  \n- We found no clear benefit of giving loop diuretics as a steady drip compared with a quick push. A small gain in fluid loss (about 0.9 kg) is possible, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- Important outcomes – death from any cause, length of hospital stay, readmission after discharge, and kidney damage (acute kidney injury – sudden loss of the kidneys ? filter waste) – were similar between the two methods, and the certainty of the evidence is low.  \n- Because the existing trials are few, small, and varied, we need more well‑designed studies to determine whether one delivery method truly helps or harms patients over longer follow‑up periods.\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it usually treated?  \nAcute heart failure (a sudden worsening of heart failure – a rapid decline in the heart’s ability to pump blood) occurs when fluid builds up in the lungs or other parts of the body. About 95 % of patients develop swelling and shortness of breath; a smaller group experiences very low blood flow to vital organs. Doctors usually admit these patients to hospital and give water‑pill diuretics (loop diuretics – medicines that help the kidneys remove excess fluid) through a vein. The drugs can be given as a quick push (bolus injection – a rapid single dose given with a needle) or as a steady drip (continuous infusion – a fluid given into a vein over a prolonged period). Both approaches aim to remove excess fluid, relieve symptoms, and avoid complications such as kidney damage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe compared a steady drip with a quick‑push delivery of loop diuretics in adults who have the most severe stages of heart failure (NYHA class III‑IV – the most advanced symptom stages) and fluid overload. We wanted to know whether one method leads to more fluid loss, lower risk of death, shorter hospital stays, fewer readmissions, or less kidney damage.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases for studies that directly compared the two dosing methods in adults with acute heart failure. We included randomized trials, quasi‑randomized trials, and comparative observational studies. Two reviewers extracted data and pooled results using meta‑analytic techniques. We assessed the certainty of each outcome with the GRADE framework (a system that rates confidence in evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified seven randomized trials that enrolled 681 adults with acute heart failure across 32 hospitals in North America, Europe, and Asia. All trials compared a steady drip with intermittent quick pushes of the same loop diuretic.\n\n- Fluid loss: The drip might lead to about 0.9 kg more weight loss on average, but the certainty is very low, so we cannot be sure the effect is real.  \n- All‑cause mortality: The drip probably makes little or no difference compared with the quick push. Certainty is low.  \n- Length of hospital stay: We saw no clear benefit or harm. Certainty is low.  \n- Readmission after discharge: Results were similar for both methods. Certainty is low.  \n- Kidney damage: No clear difference was detected; certainty is very low.  \n- Daily fluid balance: We did not find reliable data.\n\nOverall, the current data are insufficient to show that one way of delivering loop diuretics is better than the other for people with acute heart failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the results because many trials were small, participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias), and the studies varied in patient characteristics and dosing protocols. These factors lower the certainty of the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur literature search was up to date to February 2024."
