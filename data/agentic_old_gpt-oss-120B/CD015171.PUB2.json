    "output": "Are oral medicines better than no treatment for improving vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in people with Ménière’s disease?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not tell whether oral medicines improve vertigo (a feeling that the world is spinning), hearing loss (reduced ability to hear) or tinnitus (ringing or buzzing when no external sound is present) in Ménière’s disease because only a few small studies exist and the evidence is very uncertain; data on serious adverse events (unwanted effects that are severe or life‑threatening) are also limited.\n- The few trials tested different drugs – betahistine (thought to improve blood flow in the inner ear), diuretics (water pills that help the body remove excess fluid), antivirals (medicines that fight viral infections) and corticosteroids (medicines that lower inflammation and calm the immune system) – and each used different ways to measure outcomes, so we could not combine the results.\n- These findings show that larger, well‑designed studies with consistent outcome measures and full reporting of benefits and harms are needed to know if oral medicines help people with Ménière’s disease and what risks they may carry.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear, the part that helps us hear and keep balance. People experience repeated episodes of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. Attacks can start suddenly, last minutes to hours, and make everyday activities such as driving, working or walking very difficult. Because the cause is unknown, doctors cannot predict who will develop the condition or how it will progress, leaving patients with an unpredictable and often disabling illness.\n\nWhat treatments do doctors currently use?\nDoctors often prescribe oral (taken by mouth) medicines, also called systemic (affecting the whole body) pharmacological interventions, to try to reduce the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks. The most common options are:\n- Betahistine – a drug thought to improve blood flow in the inner ear.  \n- Diuretics – “water pills” that help the body get rid of excess fluid, possibly lowering pressure in the ear.  \n- Antivirals – medicines that target viruses when a viral cause is suspected.  \n- Corticosteroids – medicines that lower inflammation and calm the immune system.  \n\nWe use these drugs even though we do not fully understand how they work for Ménière’s disease, and the evidence about their benefits and harms are unclear.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe asked a simple question: Do oral medicines improve the symptoms of Ménière’s disease compared with no medicine or a placebo (a dummy treatment that looks like the real medicine but contains no active drug)? We looked for randomised controlled trials that reported effects on vertigo, hearing, tinnitus, quality of life (how a person feels overall and how well they can carry out everyday activities) and serious adverse events.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of multiple databases, trial registries and reference lists without language or date limits. Two reviewers extracted data on efficacy (e.g., vertigo frequency, hearing change, quality of life) and safety outcomes. When possible we pooled results using random‑effects meta‑analysis and assessed heterogeneity with the I² statistic. We judged the certainty of each outcome with the GRADE approach, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified ten randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that enrolled 848 adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. The trials compared oral medicines with placebo or no treatment and evaluated:\n- Betahistine in seven trials (548 participants)  \n- Diuretics in two trials (300 participants)  \n- Antivirals in one trial (24 participants)  \n- Systemic corticosteroids in one trial (16 participants)  \n\nNo eligible studies on antihistamines were found. Across all drug classes the evidence was very uncertain. We could not determine whether any medicine reduces vertigo attacks, improves hearing or tinnitus, enhances quality of life, or causes serious adverse events. In other words, we do not know if these oral medicines help or harm people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies enrolled different types of participants, used varied delivery methods, and were very small. The limited number of trials prevented reliable meta‑analysis and left substantial uncertainty about the true effects.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022, the date of our most recent search."
