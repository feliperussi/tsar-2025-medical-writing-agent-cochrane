    "output": "Title: What do health workers think about combining basic health services?\n\nKey messages  \n- Health workers’ views on primary healthcare integration (combining separate health programmes so they work together) are very mixed. Some see better coordination of care, while others report higher workload or unclear duties. The review did not find consistent harmful effects, reflecting limited and varied evidence.  \n- The evidence comes from 184 studies in 37 countries and includes policymakers, senior managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. Most studies are cross‑sectional (they look at participants at one point in time) and few use longitudinal (follow‑up over time) or ethnographic (in‑depth observation of daily work) designs. Gaps remain in low‑resource settings (places with limited money, equipment, staff), which lowers confidence in the conclusions.  \n- We recommend future research use robust mixed methods (combine numbers and words), longer‑term qualitative approaches and clear conceptual frameworks, especially in under‑represented low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs, nations with lower or middle average income).\n\nWhy is primary healthcare integration important?  \nMany countries aim for universal health coverage (UHC – the goal that everyone can obtain needed health services without financial hardship). Primary healthcare (the first level of health care that provides basic services to everyone) integration means bringing programmes such as HIV, mental health, maternal care or non‑communicable diseases (NCDs – long‑lasting conditions not spread by infection) together. This can make care more efficient, especially in low‑resource settings. However, success often depends on the people who deliver services – the health workers. Their views and everyday experiences can shape whether integration works well.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe set out to map all qualitative evidence (information from interviews, focus groups or observations) that explores health workers’ perceptions and experiences of integration. We wanted to describe where the studies were done, which services were combined, which workers were involved and how integration was carried out. This map helps researchers, policy‑makers and Cochrane (an organization that produces high‑quality systematic reviews) see gaps and plan future work.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched published papers (we did not search grey literature such as reports, theses or conference papers). We included studies that used qualitative or mixed‑methods designs. Two reviewers extracted key characteristics and counted them to create a systematic descriptive overview (a structured summary without full quantitative analysis). We also assessed our confidence in each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n- We identified 184 studies (reported in 191 papers) from 37 countries. Roughly half came from high‑income countries (HICs – nations with high average income) and half from LMICs. The United States, South Africa and Uganda contributed the most studies.  \n- Six groups of health services were combined:  \n  - mental and behavioural health,  \n  - HIV, tuberculosis (TB – a disease caused by a specific type of bacteria that spreads through the air) and sexual‑reproductive health,  \n  - maternal, women’s and child health,  \n  - non‑communicable diseases,  \n  - general primary‑care services, and  \n  - allied or specialised services (support professionals such as physiotherapists or specialists).  \n  Within each group, integration was described as full (all services merged) or partial (some services combined).  \n- Three integration strategies were used:  \n  - horizontal integration (linking services at the same level),  \n  - service expansion (adding new services), and  \n  - service linkage (planned ways to connect programmes, such as referral pathways).  \n- A broad mix of health‑worker populations participated: policymakers (people who create health rules), senior managers (high‑level leaders), middle and frontline managers (who supervise day‑to‑day work), clinicians (doctors, nurses and doctors who treat patients), allied health professionals (e.g., physiotherapists, dietitians), lay health workers (community members with basic training) and health‑system support staff (administrators, cleaners).  \n- The overall evidence base is heterogeneous (contains many different types of studies). This diversity means that contextual factors (culture, economics or politics) can influence how integration works and how health workers experience it.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence because most studies are cross‑sectional, the scope of integration is often unclear, and geographic coverage is uneven. The evidence does not cover all health‑worker groups or outcomes, and the number of studies is insufficient to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered literature up to July 2020.\n\nWhat should future research do?  \nWe suggest longer‑term longitudinal or ethnographic studies that follow health workers over time. Researchers should use clear conceptual frameworks and robust mixed‑methods designs. Strengthening the evidence base in LMICs will help ensure that health‑worker perspectives inform health policy, service delivery, health outcomes and the design of integration models."
