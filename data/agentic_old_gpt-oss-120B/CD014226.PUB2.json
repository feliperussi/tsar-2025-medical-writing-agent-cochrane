    "output": "Title: Is a minimally invasive tube repair with side openings (fenestrated endovascular repair, a small tube placed through a tiny cut in the groin) better than open surgery or watchful waiting for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulges in the main abdominal artery)?\n\nKey messages  \n- We could not decide whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) is better or worse than the other options because we found no randomised trials (studies that assign participants to groups by chance). No information on benefits or harms is available.  \n- Research is hard because complex AAAs are rare and vary in shape, making it difficult to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.  \n- Future work should design and run randomised trials that include enough patients with complex AAAs, possibly through coordinated agreements that require participation, to generate reliable evidence on benefits, harms and recovery.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why does it matter?  \nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge (balloon‑like enlargement) in the aorta, the main blood vessel that runs through the belly. A weak wall can stretch and may burst, which can be life‑threatening. Most AAAs occur below the kidneys, but some grow close to the kidneys and the arteries that supply them. These are called complex AAAs because the repair must keep the kidney arteries open while fixing the bulge.\n\nHow are complex abdominal aortic aneurysms usually treated?  \nDoctors have traditionally used open surgical repair (open surgery, a large cut in the abdomen to replace the damaged part with a synthetic tube). A newer, less invasive option is fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR). In FEVAR, a thin tube called a stent‑graft (a mesh‑covered tube that supports the artery) is inserted through a small cut in the groin and guided to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows (fenestrations) or notches (scallops) that line up with side arteries, allowing blood to keep flowing to vital organs while the bulge is sealed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to discover whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than open surgery or watchful waiting (conservative management, monitoring without operating). We planned to compare death rates, length of hospital stay, kidney problems, need for additional procedures and how people feel day to day (quality of life).\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe performed a systematic (planned, orderly) search of the literature for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or non‑operative care in people with complex AAAs. We intended to combine any eligible results using meta‑analysis (a method that adds together data from several studies) and to assess the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach (a system that rates how confident we are in the results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found no randomised trials that met our criteria. Therefore there were no participants or data to describe, and we cannot say whether FEVAR is better or worse than the other options.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nBecause no studies were found, we have no evidence to be confident about any outcome. The lack of trials means we cannot draw conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered all records up to March 2023."
