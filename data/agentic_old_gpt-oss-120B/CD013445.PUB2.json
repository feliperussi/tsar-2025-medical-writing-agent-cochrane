    "output": "Title: Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a tiny incision to remove kidney stones) more effective than retrograde intrarenal surgery (using a thin tube through the urinary tract) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nKey messages  \n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) (a tiny incision to remove kidney stones) may increase the chance of being stone‑free by about 10 more people per 100 and may lower the need for another procedure by about 15 per 100, while serious side effects (major complications) appear similar to retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).  \n- The review found no data on unplanned medical visits (unexpected trips to emergency or urgent‑care) or on patients’ quality of life, and the risk of ureteral stricture (narrowing of the tube that carries urine) seems comparable between the two methods.  \n- Overall confidence in the evidence is low (low‑certainty evidence), so future high‑quality trials are needed.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why do they matter?  \nKidney stones are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe flank pain, block urine flow, and lead to infection or fever. When a stone blocks the urinary tract, a person may feel sudden, intense pain, nausea, and sometimes fever. Stones can grow larger or move, so many people need treatment to avoid complications and improve daily life.\n\nHow can doctors remove kidney stones?  \nDoctors choose a treatment based on stone size, location, and the patient’s overall health. Small stones may be watched or broken with shock‑wave lithotripsy, which uses focused sound waves to fragment the stone. Larger or harder stones usually need a procedure.  \n\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) (a minimally invasive procedure where a thin camera and laser travel up through the urinary tract) reaches the kidney through the urethra, bladder and ureter.  \n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) (a tiny incision to remove kidney stones) creates a small cut in the back and inserts instruments directly into the kidney. PCNL can be done with different tract sizes: standard (≥ 24 French, about 8 mm), mini (15–23 French, about 5–8 mm), or ultra‑​mini (< 15 French, under 5 mm).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones. We examined whether one method was more likely to leave patients stone‑free (the stone‑free rate, the percentage with no detectable stones), whether it caused more or fewer major complications, and whether it reduced the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures). We also looked at length of hospital stay (days in hospital), ureteral stricture, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched five sources: the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and trial registries. We placed no limits on date or language. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared PCNL with RIRS in adults (≥ 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion. We combined results with a random‑effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the RoB 2 tool for each trial. We graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system (a framework that rates how confident we are in the results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 42 RCTs enrolling 4,571 adults with stones ranging from about 10 mm to 39 mm.  \n\n- Stone‑free rate: PCNL increased the chance of being stone‑free by roughly 10 more people per 100 compared with RIRS (risk ratio ≈ 1.10).  \n- Major complications: The number of serious side effects was essentially the same for PCNL and RIRS (risk ratio ≈ 1.00).  \n- Secondary interventions: PCNL reduced the need for another procedure by about 15 per 100 (risk ratio ≈ 0.85).  \n- Length of hospital stay: Patients who had PCNL stayed about one extra day in hospital on average.  \n- Ureteral stricture: The risk was similar for both methods.  \n\nNo trial reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in these results. Many trials did not blind participants, so people knew which treatment they received. The studies were small and varied in patient types and how the procedures were performed. Important outcomes such as unplanned visits and quality of life were not reported.\n\nWhat is the current status of the evidence ?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023. Because the certainty is low, we need more large, well‑designed RCTs that report patient‑centred outcomes such as quality of life and unplanned health‑care use."
