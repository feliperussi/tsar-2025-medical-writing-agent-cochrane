    "output": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a brain‑stimulation treatment using magnetic fields) as effective and safe as electroconvulsive therapy (a treatment that uses electric shocks) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages  \n- One small trial (79 participants) found no clear difference between magnetic seizure therapy (MST) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for overall schizophrenia symptoms. The trial suggested MST might improve memory (delayed memory deficit) and thinking abilities (cognitive function) and may reduce negative symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- The trial had several problems: it stopped early, groups were not well balanced at the start (baseline imbalance), and we could not be sure who received which treatment (unclear blinding). These issues create bias (flaws in the way a study is designed, done, or analysed). We also did not report adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment) consistently.  \n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine whether MST is truly as effective and safe as ECT for people with schizophrenia and to understand long‑term benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a challenge?  \nSchizophrenia is a group of severe mental disorders (a condition where a person has trouble telling the difference between real and unreal experiences, thinking logically, having normal emotional responses, and behaving normally in social situations). It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and problems with thinking, feeling, and relationships. The illness often disables people, affecting work, study and everyday life. Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment, but about one‑in‑five people do not get enough relief. When medicines are insufficient, we need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and how might it help?  \nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive brain‑stimulation technique. It uses brief, strong magnetic pulses to create a short seizure (sudden, uncontrolled body movements and changes in behaviour caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain). MST aims to target the brain more precisely than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and to cause fewer memory problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe asked two questions:  \n1. Does MST improve schizophrenia symptoms compared with other treatments such as ECT?  \n2. Is MST safe and tolerable (how much participants can accept a treatment’s unwanted effects so they can keep taking it)?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and others) without date or language limits. We included randomised controlled trials, quasi‑experimental designs and cohort studies that compared MST with ECT or other interventions in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Two reviewers independently extracted data on participants, interventions and outcomes. We pooled continuous outcomes using mean difference (the average difference) and dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio (a measure of‑the‑risk of a certain event, also called relative risk). We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane tool and rated certainty of the evidence with GRADE (a system that rates how trustworthy the overall evidence is, from very low to high).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified one four‑week randomised trial that enrolled 79 adults with acute (sudden, short‑term) schizophrenia. Participants received MST plus standard care or ECT plus standard care. The trial had high risk of bias because of selective reporting, early termination, baseline imbalance and unclear blinding.  \n\nWe found no clear differences between MST and ECT for:  \n- Overall condition (global state) – risk ratio = 1.12 (confidence interval = 0.73 to 1.70).  \n- Overall symptom score – mean difference = ‑0.20 (confidence interval = ‑8.08 to 7.68).  \n- Positive symptoms – mean difference = 1.40 (confidence interval = ‑1.97 to 4.77).  \n\nThe authors also reported that MST may lead to:  \n- Fewer problems with delayed memory (delayed memory deficit).  \n- Better thinking abilities (cognitive function).  \n- Lower scores for negative symptoms.  \n\nThese additional findings were based on small numbers and wide confidence intervals, so we remain uncertain about them. We did not report adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment) consistently, and no other side‑effects were described.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the study was very small, many outcomes were not reported, and the risk of bias was high. These issues reduce certainty.\n\nWhat is the current status of the evidence?  \nOur search was up to March 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.\n\nWhat do we need next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed randomised trials that compare MST with ECT, report all side‑effects, and follow participants for longer periods. Such studies will tell us whether MST can be a safe and effective alternative for people with schizophrenia."
