    "output": "Title: Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in the mouth of children and adults?\n\nKey messages  \n- Applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid medicine that contains silver and fluoride, painted on a tooth to stop decay and kill bacteria) probably reduces new root caries (cavities on the root part of a tooth) and may help stop existing cavities in primary dentition (baby teeth). The overall evidence is uncertain and side‑effects such as staining (a change in tooth colour) are not well reported.  \n- Compared with fluoride varnish (a highly concentrated fluoride coating painted on teeth), silver diamine fluoride appears to give a similar level of protection against new cavities in primary dentition, but evidence for other outcomes and for permanent dentition (adult teeth) is unclear.  \n- Many studies had methodological limitations (issues with how the studies were done) and did not report adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects) adequately. Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine how effective and safe silver diamine fluoride is for preventing and treating cavities in both baby and adult teeth.\n\nWhy is dental caries a major health problem?  \nDental caries – also called tooth decay – is the most common disease worldwide. Bacteria in dental plaque make acids that break down the hard surface of a tooth. If decay, the damage can cause pain, make eating difficult, affect confidence and social life, and lead to poor nutrition. Children and adults can both develop caries, but it is especially common in primary dentition (baby teeth) and permanent dentition (adult teeth).\n\nWhat do we usually do to stop decay?  \nWe normally rely on good oral hygiene, fluoride toothpaste, fluoride varnish, dental sealants (thin protective coatings placed in the grooves of back teeth), and restorative treatments such as fillings. Many of these approaches need a dental visit, professional skill, or repeated applications, which can be costly or hard to access in some communities. Researchers therefore look for simple, inexpensive treatments that can be applied easily.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out about silver diamine fluoride?  \nWe wanted to evaluate whether silver diamine fluoride can prevent new cavities or stop existing ones from getting worse in both primary and permanent dentition. Specifically we asked:  \n- Does silver diamine fluoride prevent new cavities or arrest (stop) existing cavities in baby teeth and adult teeth, including the crown (the chewing part) and the root?  \n- How does it compare with no treatment, placebo (a substance that looks like the treatment but contains no active ingredient), fluoride varnish, sealants, or atraumatic restorative treatment (ART – a minimally invasive method that uses hand tools and glass‑ionomer cement)?  \n- Are there differences in how often it should be applied, what concentration to use, or how long treatment should continue?  \n- What adverse effects occur, especially staining, pain, or sensitivity, and how do patients feel about the appearance of their teeth after treatment?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions in children and adults. We combined and summarised the results and rated our confidence using GRADE (a system that rates how certain we are about research findings, from high to very low certainty).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 29 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 13,036 participants (12,020 children and 1,016 older adults). All trials evaluated topical (applied to the surface) silver diamine fluoride for preventing or managing dental caries. Comparators were placebo or no treatment, fluoride varnish, sealants or resin infiltration, and ART using glass‑ionomer cement. Some studies also examined different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of application. Participants ranged from early childhood to older‑adult age and could have had no cavities or existing lesions.\n\nThe most certain evidence shows that applying silver diamine fluoride probably reduces the development of new root caries – on average about 0.8 fewer affected surfaces per person – in both children and older adults. For all other outcomes the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether silver diamine fluoride prevents new cavities in primary dentition or on the crowns of permanent teeth, whether it helps stop existing cavities from getting worse, or whether it is better than fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or ART. Different application schedules (frequency, concentration, or duration) also show no clear advantage. Information on adverse effects and tooth staining is limited and uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because many trials were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, introducing bias. Reporting of side‑effects, especially staining, was poor.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
