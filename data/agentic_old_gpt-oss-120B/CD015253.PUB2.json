    "output": "Is self‑inflating the nose (autoinflation) effective for treating fluid‑filled ears (otitis media with effusion) in children?\n\nKey messages  \n- We found that autoinflation may improve hearing and reduce middle‑ear fluid, but the evidence is uncertain and a small chance of ear pain exists.  \n- We also saw a modest improvement in ear‑related quality of life (how someone feels and functions day‑to‑day) in the short term.  \n- Because the studies are small, short and of low quality, we need larger, longer‑lasting trials to confirm any real benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is otitis media with effusion and why does it matter?  \nOtitis media with effusion (fluid‑filled middle ear) is common in young children. Fluid builds up behind the eardrum and muffles sound. When hearing stays reduced for weeks or months, children may struggle to follow instructions, become irritable, and fall behind in speech and school. Prolonged fluid can affect listening, speech development and overall learning.\n\nHow do doctors usually manage this condition?  \n- **Watchful waiting** (closely watching a child’s condition but not giving any treatment unless signs change).  \n- Medical options such as nasal balloons or medicines (evidence is limited).  \n- Surgical insertion of tiny ventilation tubes (grommets) to drain fluid.  \n- Mechanical methods that try to open the ear’s natural ventilation passage, the Eustachian tube (a narrow passage that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose), by creating gentle pressure in the nose. Autoinflation is one of these methods; the child blows into a small balloon‑like device placed in the nostril to generate pressure that can open the Eustachian tube and let fluid drain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe asked whether autoinflation helps children with otitis media with effusion. Specifically, we looked for improvements in hearing, reductions in fluid, changes in quality of life, and any harms such as ear pain.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major trial registers and databases for studies that compared autoinflation with watchful waiting or other non‑surgical treatments in children with fluid‑filled ears. We combined the results (data synthesis) and rated how confident we are in the evidence (confidence assessment).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 11 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that enrolled 1,036 children aged 6 months to 12 years (most were 3–11 years). All trials compared a self‑administered autoinflation technique (nasal balloon or similar handheld device) with watchful waiting. Children usually performed the manoeuvre two to three times daily for 2–12 weeks; the longest follow‑up was 11 weeks.\n\nOur synthesis showed:  \n- **Hearing:** The evidence that autoinflation restores normal hearing is very uncertain. One small study suggested a possible benefit, but the certainty is low.  \n- **Quality of life:** One study reported a modest improvement in ear‑related quality of life; the result is promising but based on limited data.  \n- **Ear pain:** We are very uncertain whether autoinflation increases ear pain. One trial found a higher risk, but overall events were few and certainty is very low.  \n- **Fluid persistence:** Autoinflation may reduce the number of children who still have fluid after a few months by about nine per 100, but this estimate is also of low certainty.\n\nOverall, all findings are of low or very low certainty. This means we have little confidence in the exact size of any benefit or harm. We need to weigh the possible gains against the effort of doing the manoeuvre regularly and the uncertain risk of ear pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \n- Many trials were small and short, so they may miss long‑term effects.  \n- Participants and researchers often knew which group received the device, which can bias results.  \n- Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and the way the device was used varied between studies.  \n- The overall, the evidence quality is low, reducing our confidence in the conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to January 2023, so the summary reflects evidence available at that time."
