        "output": "Title: Does a coordinated, team‑based (multidisciplinary) care model, including nurse‑led or digital health‑support, improve survival and reduce hospital stays for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages  \n- Coordinated team‑based care (multidisciplinary care, a team of health‑care professionals from several specialties) that includes nurse‑led or digital health support (mHealth, health services delivered through mobile devices, and eHealth, digital technologies used to deliver care) probably reduces the risk of death from any cause (all‑cause mortality) in adults with atrial fibrillation. It makes little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions (all‑cause hospitalisation) and it reduces hospital stays related to the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular hospitalisation). The evidence is of moderate to high quality and no harmful effects were reported.  \n- The effect on deaths specifically from heart disease (cardiovascular mortality), strokes, and major bleeding remains uncertain‑ly because the available randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) were few and of lower quality.  \n- Future research should test larger, well‑designed trials that compare different ways of organising care, include a range of digital tools, examine long‑term outcomes and side effects, and explore which approaches work best for different patient groups.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?  \nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heartbeat that occurs when the electrical signals in the atria (the two upper chambers of the heart) fire rapidly and at the same time. This makes the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure, and early death. AF becomes more common as people live longer and mainly affects older adults (usually aged 60‑70 years). Managing AF often requires medicines, lifestyle advice, and sometimes procedures to control the heartbeat or prevent blood clots.\n\nHow is care for people with atrial fibrillation usually organised?  \nIn many health systems, people with AF receive usual care (the care a provider would normally give). This typically involves a doctor visit, a prescription, and follow‑up as needed. Researchers think that a more coordinated approach—multidisciplinary care that includes doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists, or the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth)—could improve outcomes. These organised services aim to address every aspect of the patient’s condition together rather than in separate visits.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether organised clinical services for AF—such as collaborative, multidisciplinary teams or virtual/e‑health models—lead to better health results compared with usual care. Specifically we examined whether these services reduce death from any cause, lower the need for hospital stays, and affect heart‑related deaths, strokes, bleeding events, quality of life (overall enjoyment of life and ability to do daily activities), symptom burden, and health‑care costs.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (to Oct 2022) and trial registries (to Apr 2023) without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared multicomponent, multidisciplinary or e‑health AF services with usual care in adults (≥18 years). Three reviewers extracted data. We pooled risk ratios (relative risk) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes using random‑effects analyses. We measured heterogeneity — the I² statistic (a percentage that shows how much study results differ because of real differences) — and rated confidence in the evidence with GRADE (a system that rates how confident we can be in findings).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nEight trials (8205 participants) from China, the Netherlands and Australia met our criteria. Four trials tested nurse‑led multidisciplinary care and two tested mHealth programmes; six trials contributed data to meta‑analyses. Compared with usual care, organised AF services probably reduced all‑cause mortality (risk ratio 0.64; 95 % CI 0.46‑0.89; moderate certainty; NNTB 37 over 6 years) and cardiovascular hospitalisation (risk ratio 0.83; 95 % CI 0.71‑0.96; high certainty; NNTB 28 over 6 years). They probably made little or no difference to all‑cause hospitalisation (risk ratio 0.94; 95 % CI 0.88‑1.02; moderate certainty; NNTB 101 over 2 years). Evidence for cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio 0.64; 95 % CI 0.35‑1.19) was low certainty, and effects on thromboembolic events (risk ratio 1.14) and major bleeding (risk ratio 1.25) were also uncertain (low certainty). No data on minor bleeding were reported. No harmful effects were identified.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings because participants and clinicians often knew which care model they received, the trials were relatively small, and the interventions varied across studies. The evidence does not cover all outcomes of interest, such as quality of life and cost.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023, the date of our most recent search."
