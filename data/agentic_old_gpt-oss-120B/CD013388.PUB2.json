    "output": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalised mental training to help with daily activities) effective for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (a condition where a person loses the ability to think, remember, learn, make decisions, and solve problems)?\n\nKey messages  \n- Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia achieve more daily‑activity goals and feel satisfied with what they do; no serious harms were reported, but a few small negative effects on memory and anxiety (feelings of fear, dread, and uneasiness that may occur as a reaction to stress) were seen.  \n- For care partners (family members or friends who provide support), the training produced small improvements in social and psychological (having to do with how the mind works and how thoughts and feelings affect behavior) aspects of quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) and little impact on physical health, while a few studies noted slight increases in depression (a mental condition marked by ongoing feelings of sadness, loss of energy, and difficulty coping).  \n- More well‑designed research is needed, especially studies that follow participants for longer periods, to confirm benefits, understand why any negative effects occur, and identify who is most likely to benefit.\n\nWhat is dementia and why does it matter?  \nDementia slowly damages the brain. It makes thinking, remembering, and everyday tasks harder. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage, people can still do many things on their own, but they often struggle with simple activities such as cooking, paying bills, or remembering appointments. These problems reduce independence, increase the need for help from care partners, and lower quality of life for both the person with dementia and their supporters.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation and how might it help?  \nCognitive rehabilitation (a personalised, goal‑focused programme that helps people manage daily challenges) works with the person’s own tasks. Rather than trying to “fix” memory loss, it helps people find practical ways to cope. For example, a checklist can guide the steps in a recipe, and reminders can support medication use. The approach focuses on what the person can still do and how to keep them as independent as possible. Trained therapists usually deliver it in one‑to‑one sessions, and they may involve a care partner to support the goals.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe asked two main questions:  \n1. Does cognitive rehabilitation improve everyday functioning and outcomes such as confidence, memory, mood, and quality of life for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?  \n2. Does cognitive rehabilitation also affect the wellbeing of care partners?  \n\nWe also explored whether factors such as the type of dementia, the length of the programme, or how it is delivered change the results.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that randomly assigned people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and their care partners to either cognitive rehabilitation or a comparison condition. We included studies that used random allocation, reported everyday‑functioning outcomes, and involved care partners. We pooled results from eligible trials and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants with mild‑to‑moderate dementia. Participants were on average 76–80 years old; men ranged from 29 % to 79 % of each study. About 59 % of the total sample had Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type of dementia. All trials compared a personalised, solution‑focused cognitive rehabilitation programme with inactive control or usual care (the care that a provider would normally give outside a study). Outcomes were measured at the end of treatment and at medium‑term follow‑up (3 to 12 months).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n- People who received cognitive rehabilitation showed a large increase in their ability to achieve everyday goals. The benefit was present right after the programme and lasted up to a year.  \n- Participants probably felt more satisfied with the goals they reached.  \n- The programme probably improved self‑confidence a little and short‑term memory a little. It also probably helped attention a little at follow‑up.  \n- There is some evidence that it may slightly reduce overall functional ability in the medium term, and it may slightly worsen memory and anxiety, although we are less certain about these effects.  \n\nFor care partners:  \n- The programme may slightly improve environmental aspects of quality of life but may also slightly increase depression and reduce psychological wellbeing, with low certainty.  \n- At medium‑term follow‑up, the programme probably improves the social side of quality of life and probably improves the psychological side as well.  \n- For many other outcomes, the evidence suggests the programme probably makes little or no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because participants likely knew which treatment they received (risk of bias) and because the studies were small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
