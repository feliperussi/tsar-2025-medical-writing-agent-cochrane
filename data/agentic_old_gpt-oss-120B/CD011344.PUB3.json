    "output": "Is giving epidural pain relief in scheduled automatic doses (automated mandatory bolus) better than a continuous drip (basal infusion) for women in labour?\n\nKey messages\n- Automated mandatory bolus (a programmed dose given at set intervals) gives better pain control than basal infusion (a continuous low‑dose drip), reduces breakthrough pain (a sudden increase in pain despite the epidural) and uses less local anaesthetic (medicine that numbs nerves); no serious harms to mother or baby were reported.\n- The review found little or no difference between the two methods for caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery (use of forceps or vacuum), length of labour, or newborn Apgar scores (a quick test of the baby’s health). Maternal satisfaction (how happy the mother feels about her pain relief) may be higher with automated bolus, but the evidence is mixed.\n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm these findings, especially for rare side effects and optimal dosing schedules, because the current evidence is moderately confident but not definitive.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why do we use it during labour?\nWe explain that epidural analgesia (pain relief delivered by placing a thin tube into the epidural space – the outer part of the spinal canal) numbs the nerves that carry pain from the belly, pelvis and perineum (the area between the anus and vulva). A local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks nerve signals) is usually mixed with a small amount of an opioid (a strong pain‑killing drug) to improve comfort.\n\nHow are epidural medicines given and what are the two main delivery methods?\nOnce the catheter is in place, we can give the medicines in two ways:\n- Basal infusion (BI): a pump delivers a steady, continuous flow of medication, like a drip that never stops.\n- Automated mandatory bolus (AMB): a pump gives a larger dose at regular intervals (for example, every hour), even if the woman does not ask for more.\nWomen can also press a button for extra doses; this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). We wanted to know which method provides better pain control and fewer side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe compared AMB with BI in women at term who were in labour. We looked for differences in breakthrough pain, total local anaesthetic use, maternal satisfaction, and any increase in risks such as caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, longer labour, or low Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched several databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov) for randomised trials that compared AMB with BI. We combined the results and rated confidence using the GRADE system (a framework that grades how sure we are about the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 randomised trials involving 4 590 women at term. Most trials enrolled healthy first‑time mothers (nulliparous) and a few included experienced mothers (multiparous). The studies used different local anaesthetics – ropivacaine, levobupivacaine or bupivacaine – often combined with fentanyl or sufentanil (strong opioids). Some trials started with a combined spinal‑epidural (CSE) technique, others with a standard epidural, and one used a dural puncture epidural (DPE).\n\nMain results\n- Breakthrough pain: AMB probably reduces it. About 20 per 100 women experience breakthrough pain with AMB + AMB versus about 30 per 100 with BI.\n- Local anaesthetic use: AMB probably lowers consumption slightly.\n- Caesarean delivery: AMB makes little or no difference.\n- Instrumental delivery: AMB makes little or no difference.\n- Length of labour: AMB makes little or no difference.\n- Newborn Apgar scores: AMB makes little or no difference.\n- Maternal satisfaction: AMB may increase satisfaction, but the evidence is uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident because many trials were not blinded (participants may have known which method they received), some did not report all outcomes, and the studies varied in participants and techniques. The evidence does not cover every possible group or rare side effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches were up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
