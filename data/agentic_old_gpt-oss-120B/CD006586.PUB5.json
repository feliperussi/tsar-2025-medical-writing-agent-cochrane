    "output": "Do birth control pills that contain drospirenone (a synthetic hormone that acts like the natural hormone progesterone) improve premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and are they safe compared with not using them?\n\nKey messages\n- Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives (birth‑control pills that contain two hormones – an estrogen and a progestin) may give a small‑to‑moderate reduction in overall PMS symptoms and may help women feel more able to work, socialize and maintain relationships, but the evidence is limited and of low quality (low‑quality evidence = research findings that are not very reliable because of small sample sizes, study design flaws or inconsistent results). At the same time, these pills cause more unwanted or harmful effects (adverse effects) such as breast tenderness, nausea and irregular bleeding than not taking a pill (placebo = something that looks like the treatment but contains no medicine).\n- No study compared drospirenone‑containing pills with other types of combined oral contraceptives, so we cannot say whether they are better or worse than alternative birth‑control options.\n- Existing evidence comes from only five small randomised controlled trials (RCTs = studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive the treatment or a comparison) that followed women for a short time. Future research should include larger, well‑designed RCTs that follow women for several menstrual cycles, test different severity levels of symptoms, and compare drospirenone pills with other hormonal options while carefully monitoring both benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?\nMany people experience physical and emotional symptoms in the days before their period. This group of symptoms is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS = a set of physical and emotional symptoms that many people experience in the days before their period starts). In some people the symptoms are very severe; this is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD = a severe form of PMS that causes intense mood swings, irritability and other disabling symptoms before menstruation). Symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, fatigue, breast tenderness and pain. They can interfere with work, school, social life and relationships. Because PMS/PMDD is common and can reduce quality of life, we need safe and effective ways to ease the symptoms.\n\nHow are combined oral contraceptives used to treat PMS?\nCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) are birth‑control pills that contain two hormones – an estrogen (a female hormone) and a progestin (any natural or laboratory‑made substance that has some or all of the biologic effects of progesterone). Some COCs have been studied to see if they also lessen PMS symptoms, not just prevent pregnancy. Drospirenone is a synthetic hormone that acts like progesterone and may reduce water retention and have mood‑stabilising effects. A low‑dose COC that includes drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (a synthetic form of estrogen) has been approved in some countries for treating PMDD in people who also want contraception.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether drospirenone‑containing COCs improve PMS or PMDD symptoms and daily functioning, and whether they cause more unwanted effects or lead to stopping the medication compared with a placebo or other treatments.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) without date or language limits for studies that evaluated drospirenone‑containing oral contraceptives in people with PMS. We included randomised controlled trials, or cohort or case‑control studies, that compared the drospirenone pill with a placebo or another treatment and reported symptom severity or adverse effects. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, symptom scores and side‑effects. We pooled results with a random‑effects meta‑analysis when appropriate and expressed differences as mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane tool for RCTs and the Newcastle‑Ottawa Scale for observational studies. We graded the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework (a system that rates how confident we are in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 858 people, most of whom had PMDD. All trials compared a drospirenone‑containing COC with a placebo pill. No trial compared the drospirenone pill with another COC. The reports did not give details about participants’ ages, countries, follow‑up length or funding sources.\n\nMain results\nDrospirenone may reduce overall PMS symptoms a little. Women taking the drospirenone pill also reported small improvements in daily life – they were slightly more productive at work and found it easier to take‑part in social activities and maintain relationships.\n\nHowever, the pill increased the chance that women stopped taking it because of side‑effects. If about 3 out of 100 people stopped a placebo, roughly 6 to 16 out of 100 stopped the drospirenone pill. Overall unwanted effects were more common too – about 40 to 54 out of 100 people on drospirenone experienced any side‑effect, compared with about 28 out of 100 on placebo.\n\nMore people felt the treatment was helpful: about 39 to 58 out of 100 on drospirenone said it helped, versus about 36 out of 100 on placebo.\n\nWe remain uncertain whether drospirenone has a clear effect on mood‑related symptoms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which pill they received, the studies were small, they did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the study populations varied. These factors lower the certainty of the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
