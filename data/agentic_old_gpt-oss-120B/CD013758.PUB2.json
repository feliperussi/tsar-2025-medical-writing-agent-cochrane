    "output": "Does feeding full‑term babies formula with more protein versus less protein affect their growth, weight, or health?  \n\nKey messages  \n- We found no clear benefit or harm from higher‑protein formula compared with lower‑protein formula for growth measures such as underweight (low weight for age), stunting (low height for age), or wasting (low weight for height), nor for later overweight (above‑normal body weight) or obesity (excess body fat). The evidence is limited and uncertain.  \n- We also found little or no difference when standard‑protein formula was compared with low‑protein formula. No deaths occurred in any trial.  \n- Because the evidence is sparse and of low certainty (low confidence that the findings are reliable), we need larger, longer‑term, well‑designed studies to know whether protein content truly influences growth, weight status, or health in the first years of life.  \n\nWhy does the amount of protein in infant formula matter?  \nMany babies who are not breast‑fed receive infant formula to help them grow. Formula can contain different amounts of protein – the building blocks of the body. High‑protein formula provides at least 2.5 g of protein per 100 kcal; low‑protein formula provides less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal. Manufacturers think more protein might speed weight gain, but excess protein early in life could change growth patterns and raise the risk of later overweight or obesity. Parents and health professionals need clear information about whether higher‑protein formulas are better, worse, or the same as lower‑protein formulas for healthy, full‑term babies (babies born after a normal pregnancy length).  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to compare the benefits and possible harms of feeding healthy, formula‑fed term infants a higher‑protein formula versus a lower‑protein formula. Specifically, we asked whether protein level changes the chance of undernutrition (underweight, stunting, or wasting), the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood, and the occurrence of side‑effects such as diarrhea (frequent, loose bowel movements), vomiting (forceful ejection of stomach contents), or milk‑protein allergy (an exaggerated immune response to milk protein).  \n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign babies to different formula groups) that compared higher‑protein, standard‑protein, and low‑protein formulas in healthy term infants. We combined the results using meta‑analysis (a statistical method that pools data from several studies) and we rated our confidence with the GRADE approach (a system that grades the certainty of evidence from very low to high).  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 11 trials that enrolled 1,185 healthy, full‑term babies who received formula for at least three months from birth. All trials were conducted in high‑income countries (nations with high gross national income per capita). The longest follow‑up reported was 11 years, but most outcomes were measured in the first year of life.  \n\nFeeding a high‑protein formula probably makes little or no difference to weight, height, or weight‑for‑height in the first year compared with standard‑protein formula (risk ratio close to 1, meaning no difference). It also probably makes little or no difference to the chance of being overweight or obese at five years of age. The same minimal effect was seen for common side‑effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk‑protein allergy. When standard‑protein formula was compared with low‑protein formula, the results were similar – probably little or no effect on growth in the first year and on side‑effects. However, the certainty of all these findings is very low, meaning we are unsure about the true effects.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies involved different types of babies, used different ways of delivering the formula, were small, and did not include enough trials to be certain. This variability reduces the reliability of the findings.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies published up to October 2022."
