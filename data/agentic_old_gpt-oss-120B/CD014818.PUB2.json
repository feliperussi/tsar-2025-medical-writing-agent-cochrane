    "output": "Which regional pain block reduces pain the most after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages  \n- All four blocks – paravertebral block (PVB, injection next to the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, injection into the muscle plane alongside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, injection near the chest‑muscle nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, injection over the serratus muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; any small advantage is not large enough for patients to notice, and no serious complications were reported.  \n- The evidence comes from many randomised controlled trials (RCTs, studies where participants are randomly assigned to treatments), but most trials were small, so we have low confidence in the exact size of the effects.  \n- Future research should use larger, well‑designed trials that look at long‑term pain, overall recovery, opioid use, and rare side effects to determine whether any block is truly better.\n\nWhat is the problem with pain after breast cancer surgery?  \nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often feel pain afterwards. The pain can make it hard to move, sleep, and recover. It may also lead to the use of strong pain medicines that have their own side‑effects. Regional analgesia (a pain‑relieving injection near nerves) can reduce this pain. Several types of regional blocks are used:\n\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spine that numbs the nerves supplying the breast.  \n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into the muscle plane alongside the spine.  \n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection around the chest muscles that supply the breast.  \n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the side of the chest to block nerves that run along the ribs.\n\nThese techniques can lower the need for opioids, but they also carry risks such as accidental injury to nerves or blood vessels, or a reaction to the and local anaesthetic (medicine that prevents you from feeling pain). Because many blocks are available, it is unclear which works best and which is safest.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe compared the four regional analgesia techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Our main questions were:\n\n1. How well does each technique reduce postoperative pain (pain after surgery)? Pain was measured on a 0‑to‑10 scale using a visual analogue scale (a line that patients mark) or a numeric rating scale (a number from 0 to 10).  \n2. Do any of the techniques cause more complications or side‑effects? (Complications = adverse events or harmful effects that occur as a result of a medical procedure.)  \n3. Do the blocks affect other outcomes such as speed of recovery, amount of extra pain medication needed, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV, feeling sick or throwing up after surgery)?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that compared the blocks after breast cancer surgery. We included trials that reported pain and safety outcomes. We combined the results using a network meta‑analysis (a statistical method that compares many treatments at once, even if some were not directly compared in the same trial). We judged the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE framework (a system that rates how much confidence we can place in the findings).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 39 trials involving 2,348 women (most had a modified radical mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast and many lymph nodes). All trials used ultrasound guidance (real‑time images to place the needle) and a single‑shot long‑acting anaesthetic (one injection that lasts many hours).\n\nCompared with a paravertebral block, the other blocks made little or no difference to pain at rest 2 hours after surgery. The pectoral nerve block may reduce pain when moving at 2 hours, but the erector spinae plane block made little or no difference for that outcome. At 24 hours, pectoral nerve, erector spinae plane and serratus anterior plane blocks each made little or no difference to pain at rest or during movement. At 48 hours, erector spinae plane and pectoral nerve blocks probably made little or no difference, but the evidence is very uncertain. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, nerve injury or pneumothorax (air in the chest cavity that can‑collapse a lung) were reported in the small number of studies that looked at safety, and we remain very uncertain whether any technique changes the risk of complications.\n\nOverall, the four regional blocks appear comparable and probably make little or no difference to postoperative pain or the chance of serious complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost studies were very small and used slightly different patient groups or injection techniques. This makes the results uncertain, so we have low confidence in the exact effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
