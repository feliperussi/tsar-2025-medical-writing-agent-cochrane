    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes giving preterm babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds help them start full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey Messages\n- It is unclear if exposing preterm babies to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds helps them reach full sucking feeds sooner. Overall, this may make little to no difference to feeding milestones. Only two studies reported on unwanted effects and did not find any; feeding intolerance (trouble digesting feeds) was not reported at all.\n- The smell and taste of milk probably makes little to no difference to the chance of late infection (infections that happen after the first days in hospital). It may make little to no difference to time on nutrition through a vein (parenteral nutrition) and to the chance of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious bowel disease in preterm babies).\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be confident in the results. Future research should use strong study methods, include babies of different gestational ages and both sexes, clearly report unwanted effects and feeding intolerance, and test the best way, timing, and frequency to give smell and taste.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nPreterm babies often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing well enough to feed by mouth. Many start with tube feeding. Tube feeding means giving milk through a thin tube into the stomach through the nose (nasogastric) or mouth (orogastric). Because milk goes straight to the stomach, babies may not smell or taste it.\n\nSmell and taste can help the body get ready to digest food. Some people wonder if letting babies smell or taste milk right before or during tube feeds might help them move faster to feeding by mouth.\n\nHow might smell and taste help?\nSmell and taste can trigger the body’s “pre‑absorptive” responses. In simple terms, this means the body prepares to digest food even before swallowing it. If this helps feeding skills, it could shorten hospital stays and reduce stress for families.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether giving preterm babies the smell or taste of breast milk or formula, right before or during tube feeds, helps them:\n- reach full enteral feeds (all nutrition through the gut) sooner,\n- move to full sucking feeds (all feeds by mouth) sooner,\n- and whether it affects safety outcomes, such as infection, feeding intolerance, and necrotising enterocolitis.\n\n[Optional] How is feeding measured in preterm babies?\n- Full enteral feeds: all nutrition goes into the gut (by tube or mouth), with no nutrition through a vein.\n- Full sucking feeds: all feeds are taken by mouth, with no tube feeding.\n- Parenteral nutrition: nutrition given through a vein when the gut is not ready.\n- Necrotising enterocolitis: a serious bowel disease that can happen in preterm babies.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving smell or taste of milk during tube feeds versus not doing this. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm babies. Of these, 7 studies (1244 babies) provided data we could use. The studies took place in hospital neonatal units and compared exposure to the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula, given right before or during tube feeds, against no exposure. The studies used different ways to give smell and taste. Not all studies reported safety outcomes, and none reported feeding intolerance. The countries and funding sources were not clearly reported in the abstract.\n\nMain results:\n- Time to full sucking feeds: It is unclear if giving smell and taste of milk helps babies reach full sucking feeds sooner. It may make little to no difference.\n- Time to full enteral feeds: It is unclear if smell and taste help babies reach full enteral feeds sooner. It may make little to no difference.\n- Time on parenteral nutrition (nutrition through a vein): Giving smell and taste of milk may make little to no difference.\n- Necrotising enterocolitis (serious bowel disease): Giving smell and taste of milk may make little to no difference to the chance of this problem.\n- Late infection (after the first days in hospital): Giving smell and taste of milk probably makes little to no difference.\n- Unwanted effects: Only two studies reported on unwanted effects and did not find any. Overall, harmful effects were not well reported. Feeding intolerance was not reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because:\n- In some studies, babies were not randomly placed into the different groups. This means differences could be due to differences between babies rather than the exposure itself.\n- In many studies, parents and staff likely knew which exposure the baby received, and the person who measured outcomes often knew this too.\n- The studies used different inclusion rules and different ways of giving smell and taste, which makes results harder to compare.\n- The studies were small, and there were not enough studies for some outcomes.\n- Some important outcomes, like feeding intolerance, were not reported.\n\nThere is one ongoing study and two studies that still need to be assessed. These could change the conclusions when their results are available.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
