    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of maintenance treatment after remission for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a slow‑growing blood cancer)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Anti‑CD20 medicines (rituximab or ofatumumab) and lenalidomide probably keep chronic lymphocytic leukaemia from getting worse for longer, but they probably do not help people live longer. These treatments may increase side effects, including serious ones that need medical care. When quality of life was measured, there may have been little to no difference.\n- We do not know if alemtuzumab helps, and there is concern about infections with this medicine. We did not find studies of newer targeted maintenance medicines, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors or B‑cell lymphoma‑2 inhibitors, or of obinutuzumab.\n- Future research should test newer options, report quality of life, and track harms carefully over longer periods, so we can understand who benefits most and at what cost in side effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why consider maintenance treatment?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a blood cancer that usually grows slowly. It affects certain white blood cells called lymphocytes. Many people with CLL respond to their first treatment and go into remission. Remission means signs and symptoms of cancer shrink or disappear.\n\nAfter remission, some people choose medical observation (regular check‑ups without ongoing cancer medicine). Others start maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment means taking regular medicine after remission to try to keep the cancer under control for longer. Options studied include:\n- anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies (lab‑made proteins that attach to cancer cells), such as rituximab or ofatumumab\n- lenalidomide (an immunomodulatory drug that affects the immune system)\n- alemtuzumab (an anti‑CD52 monoclonal antibody)\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether maintenance treatment after remission helps people with CLL:\n- live longer (overall survival)\n- live longer without their CLL getting worse (progression‑free survival)\n- feel better (health‑related quality of life)\nWe also looked at harms, including serious side effects that usually need medical care (often called grade 3 or 4), all side effects, deaths caused by treatment, and how often people stop treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared maintenance treatments with placebo or medical observation, or compared different maintenance treatments. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in them, based on how the studies were done and their size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with 2393 people who had CLL and were in remission after earlier treatment. Seven studies compared rituximab or ofatumumab with observation. Three studies compared lenalidomide with placebo or observation. One small study compared alemtuzumab with observation. We did not find studies of newer targeted maintenance medicines such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, B‑cell lymphoma‑2 inhibitors, or obinutuzumab.\n\nPeople in the studies were mostly between 54 and 72 years old, and more were men than women. The cancer stage and earlier treatments differed across studies. Follow‑up ranged from about 1 year to just over 6 years. The reports did not clearly describe who funded each study.\n\nMain results\n\nAnti‑CD20 medicines (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation\n- Time without CLL getting worse: Anti‑CD20 maintenance probably increases the time people live without their CLL getting worse.\n- Living longer: Anti‑CD20 maintenance probably makes little to no difference to how long people live.\n- Side effects: Anti‑CD20 maintenance may increase serious side effects and may increase overall side effects. It may make little to no difference to deaths caused by treatment, and may make little to no difference to how often people stop treatment. When quality of life was measured, there may be little to no difference.\n\nLenalidomide versus placebo or observation\n- Time without CLL getting worse: Lenalidomide maintenance probably causes a large increase in the time people live without their CLL getting worse.\n- Living longer: Lenalidomide maintenance probably makes little to no difference to how long people live.\n- Side effects: Lenalidomide maintenance may increase serious side effects and probably increases overall side effects slightly. It may slightly increase deaths caused by treatment, but we are uncertain about this. We are very uncertain about the effect on how often people stop treatment. No study measured quality of life.\n\nAlemtuzumab versus observation\n- Time without CLL getting worse: We do not know if alemtuzumab changes the time without CLL getting worse because the study was very small and results are very uncertain.\n- Other outcomes: We did not find information about living longer, quality of life, side effects, deaths caused by treatment, or stopping treatment. There is a warning about infections with this medicine.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that maintenance with rituximab, ofatumumab, or lenalidomide delays the return of active CLL, but we are less confident about many other results. People and treatments differed across studies, some studies were small (especially for alemtuzumab), and not all important outcomes were measured or reported, such as quality of life. In some studies, people likely knew which treatment they received, which can affect how symptoms are reported. We also did not find studies of newer targeted maintenance medicines, so the results do not tell us about those options.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022."
