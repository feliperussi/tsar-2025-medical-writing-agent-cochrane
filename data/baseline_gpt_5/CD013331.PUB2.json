    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of TENS (a small device that sends mild electrical pulses through the skin) for period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared with a pretend device (placebo) or no treatment. Unwanted effects were rarely reported, so we do not know enough about safety from these studies.\n- We do not know whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS works better, or how TENS compares with common pain medicines such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), or with other therapies like acupressure.\n- We need larger, better-designed studies that clearly report pain relief, unwanted effects, need for extra pain relief, effects on daily activities, and quality of life.\n\nWhy does period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea) matter?\nPeriod pain, also called menstrual cramps or primary dysmenorrhoea, is common in people who have periods. It can cause cramping in the lower belly, back pain, and tiredness. For many, it affects school, work, and daily life, especially on the first days of bleeding.\n\nWhat is TENS and how might it help?\nTENS stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. It is a small, battery-powered device. You place sticky pads on the skin where you feel pain. The device sends gentle electrical pulses through the skin. These pulses may block pain signals, help the body release natural pain-relief chemicals, and relax tight muscles. High-frequency TENS sends faster pulses. Low-frequency TENS sends slower pulses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if TENS (high-frequency or low-frequency) reduces period pain. We also wanted to know if TENS causes any unwanted effects. We compared TENS with a pretend device (placebo), no treatment, pain medicines, and other therapies.\n\nHow is period pain usually treated?\nPeople often use:\n- anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen\n- acetaminophen (paracetamol)\n- heat (for example, a hot water bottle)\n- exercise and stretching\n- hormonal birth control to reduce cramps for some people\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to April 2024 that tested TENS for period pain. We combined and summarized the results, and we rated how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies with 585 women and girls aged 12 to 49 who had period pain. The studies tested high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS and compared them with a pretend device or no treatment, with each other, or with other treatments. Not all studies reported unwanted effects. The studies took place in different settings, and most were small.\n\nMain results\n- High-frequency TENS compared with placebo or no treatment: High-frequency TENS may reduce pain. This means some people may feel less pain when using high-frequency TENS than with a pretend device or no treatment. Unwanted effects were poorly reported. In the few studies that reported them, none were seen, but we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n- Low-frequency TENS compared with placebo or no treatment: Low-frequency TENS may reduce pain. Again, harmful effects were not reported in these studies, so we do not know about safety from this comparison.\n- High-frequency TENS versus low-frequency TENS: It is unclear if one works better than the other for pain relief. One small study reported no unwanted effects, but this is not enough to judge safety.\n- TENS versus other treatments: It is unclear if high-frequency TENS works better or worse than acupressure, acetaminophen (paracetamol), or interferential current therapy. For unwanted effects compared with anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), it is unclear if there is any difference.\nWhat does this mean for you? TENS may help reduce period pain for some people when compared with doing nothing or using a pretend device. We do not know which type of TENS is better, and we do not know how TENS compares with common pain medicines or other therapies. We also do not know enough about unwanted effects because most studies did not report them.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, and results varied across studies. It is possible that people in some studies knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect how they report pain. Also, many studies did not report unwanted effects or other outcomes that matter in daily life, such as the need for extra pain relief or limits on school or work.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024."
