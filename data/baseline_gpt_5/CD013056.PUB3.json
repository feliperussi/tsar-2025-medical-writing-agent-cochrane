    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nAre antibiotic ear drops or antiseptic ear drops better for long‑lasting ear discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Quinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help more people get a dry ear within about 2 weeks than boric acid antiseptic drops. Results for other antiseptics and other antibiotic types are mixed or unclear. Unwanted effects like pain or irritation were poorly reported, so we cannot be sure about harms.\n- None of the studies measured quality of life, and serious complications were not reported. Hearing may improve slightly with quinolone drops compared with boric acid, but the difference may be too small to notice.\n- Future research should include newer, larger, well‑designed studies that report harms clearly, measure quality of life and hearing, look at longer‑term results, and include both children and adults using the treatments people receive in real life.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)?\n- CSOM is a long‑lasting ear infection that causes ongoing ear discharge through a hole in the eardrum. People often also have hearing loss.\n- It can be caused by several types of germs. The discharge can be smelly and upsetting. It can make daily life hard, especially for children at school and adults at work.\n\nWhat treatments are used for CSOM?\n- Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. People can use antibiotic ear drops, or take antibiotics by mouth or injection.\n- Antiseptics are liquids that kill or slow germs. People put antiseptics directly into the ear as drops, powders, or washes.\n- Some people also have ear cleaning by a clinician to remove discharge and debris.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to know whether antibiotics or antiseptics work better to stop ear discharge and improve hearing.\n- We also wanted to know about unwanted effects, such as pain or irritation, and whether these treatments affect quality of life or cause any harm to hearing (hearing damage from medicines is sometimes called ototoxicity).\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics for people with long‑lasting ear discharge. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 15 studies that involved 2371 people with long‑lasting ear discharge. The studies included both adults and children. Follow‑up was at least 1 week. Most results focused on short‑term changes within 2 weeks.\n- The studies compared antibiotic ear drops (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) or antibiotics taken by mouth with antiseptics such as acetic acid (vinegar‑like), boric acid, povidone‑iodine, and aluminium acetate.\n- None of the studies reported quality of life or serious complications. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Quinolone antibiotic ear drops versus boric acid antiseptic drops:\n  - Quinolone ear drops probably increase the chance that ear discharge stops within about 2 weeks compared with boric acid. In other words, for every 100 people treated, more are likely to get a dry ear with quinolone drops than with boric acid drops in the short term.\n  - Quinolone drops may cause less ear pain or irritation than boric acid drops.\n  - Quinolone drops may improve hearing slightly compared with boric acid, but the difference may be too small to notice. We do not know what happens after 4 weeks because studies did not report this.\n\n- Acetic acid antiseptic drops versus antibiotic ear drops:\n  - Compared with aminoglycoside antibiotic drops, acetic acid may help more people get a dry ear within 1 to 2 weeks.\n  - It is unclear if acetic acid works better or worse than quinolone antibiotic drops to dry up discharge in the first 2 weeks.\n  - We do not know whether acetic acid causes more pain or irritation than antibiotic drops because results were sparse and uncertain.\n  - For hearing, acetic acid and quinolone drops may make little to no difference.\n\n- Quinolone antibiotic ear drops versus povidone‑iodine antiseptic drops:\n  - We do not know if one works better to dry up ear discharge in the first 2 weeks.\n  - One small study reported no clear differences in hearing and reported no signs of hearing damage, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n  - Pain/irritation and results beyond 4 weeks were not reported.\n\n- Aluminium acetate antiseptic versus antibiotic ear drops:\n  - There was not enough information to judge whether one worked better.\n\n- Across all comparisons, no study reported quality of life. Serious complications were not reported. Reports of harms were brief, so we cannot be sure how often unwanted effects happen.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n- We are moderately confident that quinolone ear drops help more than boric acid drops in the short term. For other comparisons, we have little confidence because many studies were small, short, or old, and they did not always measure outcomes that matter to people.\n- It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they received. Not all studies provided the information we needed. There were not enough studies for some comparisons, and harms were poorly reported. Some groups of people and commonly used treatments were not well covered.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022."
