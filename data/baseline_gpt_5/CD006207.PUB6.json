    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo face masks, N95/P2 respirators (tight-fitting masks), and handwashing help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nKey Messages\n- Overall, masks worn in the community probably make little or no difference to flu-like illness (influenza-like illness, ILI) or infections confirmed by a lab test. N95/P2 respirators may reduce flu-like illness compared with surgical masks, but they probably make little or no difference to lab-confirmed influenza. Handwashing probably reduces respiratory illness slightly. Unwanted effects were rarely reported, though some people mentioned discomfort with masks and respirators.\n- We did not find studies testing gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at borders and airports. Many studies happened when virus spread was lower than during COVID-19, and people often did not use the measures consistently.\n- Future research should run large, well-designed studies in different places and groups, especially people at higher risk. Studies should also measure how well people stick with the measures and any unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are respiratory viruses and why is reducing their spread important?\nRespiratory viruses infect the nose, throat, and lungs. They include influenza (flu), SARS, and COVID-19. They can spread quickly and cause many people to get sick at the same time. During pandemics, medicines and vaccines may not be enough to stop spread. Simple physical measures can help slow infection while medicines and vaccines are developed or rolled out.\n\nWhat are physical measures to reduce spread?\nPhysical measures try to block virus spread from person to person. These include:\n- handwashing (hand hygiene)\n- wearing face masks or tight-fitting masks called N95/P2 respirators\n- keeping distance from others (physical distancing)\n- isolating or quarantining people who might be infectious\n- eye protection such as glasses\n- gargling\n- screening people at borders or entry points\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well physical measures interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. We focused on common outcomes, such as flu-like illness (ILI) and infections confirmed by lab tests.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these physical measures with not using them, or with other measures. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe included 78 studies in total, with 11 new studies in this update that involved 610,872 people. Six new studies were done during the COVID-19 pandemic (from Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway). Many other studies took place during flu seasons before 2016 or during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when virus spread was often lower than during COVID-19.\n\nStudies happened in many places: schools, childcare centers, homes, hospital wards, crowded inner-city areas, and immigrant neighborhoods. Many studies reported that people did not use the measures consistently. We found four ongoing studies on masks; one had finished but had not reported results. We did not find any studies on gowns and gloves, face shields, or border entry screening. Few studies measured unwanted effects.\n\nMain results\n- Medical/surgical masks compared with no masks (mostly in the community): Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to flu-like illness or infections confirmed by lab tests. This applies to both flu and COVID-19â€“like illness.\n- N95/P2 respirators compared with surgical masks (mostly in healthcare settings): We do not know if N95/P2 respirators reduce general respiratory symptoms compared with surgical masks. N95/P2 respirators may reduce flu-like illness compared with surgical masks. However, they probably make little or no difference to lab-confirmed influenza. One large study in healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients found that surgical masks worked about as well as N95 respirators.\n- Handwashing compared with no handwashing program: Handwashing probably reduces respiratory illness slightly. For every 1000 people, about 50 fewer might get a respiratory illness when handwashing programs are used. Handwashing may make little or no difference to flu-like illness or lab-confirmed influenza when looked at separately. When outcomes were combined, handwashing may reduce respiratory illness slightly.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about how the studies were done and reported. It is possible that people in the studies knew which measures they were using. Not all studies reported everything we were interested in, including unwanted effects. The studies took place in very different settings and used different ways of measuring illness. Many studies happened when virus spread was lower than during COVID-19, and people often did not use the measures consistently. For some questions, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
