    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a keyhole stent with small holes to keep blood flowing to the kidneys) better than open surgery or monitoring without surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find any randomized studies (studies where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared FEVAR with open surgery or with monitoring without surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because of this, we do not know if FEVAR improves survival, shortens hospital stay, or affects kidney problems compared with these options. Unwanted effects were not reported because no eligible studies were found.\n- Complex aneurysms are uncommon and vary a lot in shape and position. This makes fair comparison studies hard to do. It may also be difficult to assign people by chance to very different treatments.\n- Future research should include fair comparison studies that follow people long enough and report outcomes that matter to patients and families, such as survival, kidney health, need for more procedures, quality of life, and harms. Health systems may need special agreements to help include all eligible patients in studies.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge in the main blood vessel in the belly (the aorta). If an aneurysm grows, it can burst and cause life‑threatening bleeding. Some aneurysms are “complex.” This means the bulge is close to, or involves, the arteries that supply the kidneys and intestines. These aneurysms are harder to repair safely.\n\nWhy might a special “fenestrated” repair help?\nStandard keyhole repair uses a tube made of fabric supported by a metal mesh (a stent‑graft) placed inside the aorta through small cuts in the groin. In complex aneurysms, a standard stent‑graft might block blood flow to the kidneys or intestines. Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) uses a custom stent‑graft with carefully placed small openings (“fenestrations” or “scallops”). These openings line up with the arteries to the kidneys and intestines so blood can keep flowing to them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether FEVAR works better or worse than:\n- open surgical repair (open surgery to replace the bulging part of the aorta with a fabric tube), or\n- monitoring without surgery (also called conservative management), which means regular checks and medicines but no operation.\n\nWe looked for differences in survival at 30 days and 1 year, deaths due to the aneurysm, kidney problems, length of hospital stay, the need for more procedures, how well the stent keeps vessels open, quality of life, and harms.\n\nHow are complex abdominal aortic aneurysms treated?\n- FEVAR (fenestrated endovascular repair): a custom keyhole stent‑graft with small openings to keep blood flowing to the kidneys and intestines.\n- Open surgical repair: an operation through the belly to remove the bulging part and sew in a fabric tube.\n- Monitoring without surgery (conservative management): careful follow‑up with scans and medicines, delaying surgery unless risks change.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for randomized studies (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) and similar fair comparison studies in adults with complex aneurysms that compared FEVAR with open surgery or with monitoring. We planned to combine results and judge how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no studies that met our criteria. This means we cannot say whether FEVAR helps people live longer, reduces time in hospital, protects kidney function, lowers the chance of aneurysm‑related death, improves quality of life, or changes the need for new procedures when compared with open surgery or with monitoring without surgery. We also cannot describe unwanted effects, because no eligible studies reported them.\n\nWe planned to include adults with complex aneurysms and to look at results at 30 days and 1 year. We also planned to record where the studies took place, who funded them, and how long they followed people. Because no studies were eligible, we cannot report on these features.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because we did not find any randomized or similar fair comparison studies. Complex aneurysms are less common and vary in shape and position, which makes studies difficult to organize. It may also be hard to place people into treatment groups by chance when doctors and patients feel one treatment may be safer for a specific aneurysm. As a result, we still do not know the benefits and harms of FEVAR compared with open surgery or with monitoring without surgery.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
