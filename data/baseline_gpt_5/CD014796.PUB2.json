    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat do people and health workers think about general health checks (screening tests for people without symptoms), and what affects their use?\n\nKey Messages\n- General health checks are popular and can motivate people to change their lifestyle and feel reassured about their health. We are moderately confident that fear of bad results, limited time, and worries about treatment costs can reduce attendance. The studies did not report medical harms from the checks, but poor-quality providers and confusing information discouraged some people.\n- We are confident that people value skilled, respectful, and culturally aware providers (able to understand and respect a person’s culture and language). We are moderately confident that clear invitations, education, and offering checks in different places may help more people take part. Views differed on whether checks should include many tests or be tailored to each person’s risks.\n- We did not find enough strong evidence to explain why health systems choose to offer general health checks. Future research should look at how culture, politics, funding, and local needs shape these programs, and report what matters most to people and decision-makers.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are part of preventive care. They usually include several screening tests. Screening means looking for disease or risk factors before symptoms show. These checks are offered by national programs or private providers, and aim to improve health in the community.\n\nWhy is this topic important?\nMany countries offer general health checks, but a 2019 Cochrane review found little to no effect on deaths or heart disease. Even so, people and health workers still value these checks. Understanding their views can help explain why checks are offered and used, and what helps or gets in the way.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different groups think and feel about general health checks. This included:\n- people who attend or do not attend checks (clients);\n- health workers who deliver them;\n- managers, commissioners (people who plan and fund services), and policymakers.\nWe looked for factors that affect planning (commissioning), delivery, and uptake (who attends).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that explored people’s and stakeholders’ experiences and views about general health checks, summarized the findings, and judged how much confidence we have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 146 eligible studies and closely analyzed 36 of them. Most studies took place in high-income European countries. Nearly one third were from middle-income countries in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Sixteen studies were in primary or community healthcare, 4 in workplaces, and 4 in community settings. The studies reported views from clients (25 studies), health workers (15), and managers or commissioners (9).\n\nIndividual-level views (mostly clients):\n- We are moderately confident that general health checks can motivate people to improve their lifestyle and provide reassurance through professional feedback.\n- We are moderately confident that fear of receiving bad news and a preference to seek care only when symptoms appear make some people less likely to attend.\n- We are confident that people’s beliefs about disease, risk, and prevention affect whether they go for checks.\n- We are moderately confident that family and social responsibilities, provider encouragement, easy access, clear information, time, and insurance concerns all influence attendance.\n\nIntervention-level views (clients, health workers, managers):\n- We are confident that skilled, respectful, and culturally aware providers are important for trust and uptake.\n- We are moderately confident that delivery faces practical barriers, such as limited time due to care for sick patients, staff changes and shortages, resource limits, technical issues, and payment challenges (how providers get paid).\n- We are moderately confident that offering checks in varied and convenient settings may improve access.\n- We have little confidence in the finding that tailored checks (focused on a person’s specific risks) are better than comprehensive checks with many tests, because views varied and evidence was limited.\n- We are moderately confident that clear invitations, information, and education can build awareness of checks and their pros and cons.\n- We have little confidence in the finding that explaining test results and giving recommendations is a key element, because the evidence for this was limited.\n\nContext and reasons for commissioning (planning and funding):\n- We are not confident about the findings at this level. The available evidence suggests culture, social norms, religion, gender, and language may shape how people view prevention and disease, which may affect uptake.\n- Policymakers thought that a supportive political climate and buy-in from many stakeholders are needed to establish general health checks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate overall because most studies were from certain regions, and many were small or used different methods. We purposely analyzed a subset of the eligible studies, so some views may be missing. For questions about context and commissioning, we have little to no confidence in the findings, because there were few studies and their methods and settings varied widely.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
