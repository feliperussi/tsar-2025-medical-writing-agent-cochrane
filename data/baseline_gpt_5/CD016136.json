    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs iron given by a drip into a vein (intravenous iron) better than iron tablets (oral iron) for anaemia in pregnancy?\n\nKey Messages\n- Intravenous iron probably slightly increases haemoglobin (Hb) levels and probably reduces anaemia during pregnancy. Hb is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Around birth and after birth, intravenous iron may continue to give small benefits. It probably makes little to no difference to the need for a blood transfusion and may make little to no difference to heavy bleeding after birth (postpartum haemorrhage). We did not find clear signs of more side effects with intravenous iron, but serious harms were rare and reported in different ways.\n- Breastfeeding rates probably do not differ between intravenous iron and iron tablets. No studies reported maternal satisfaction or maternal well‑being, so we cannot comment on these outcomes.\n- We did not find enough good‑quality evidence to answer all safety questions. Future studies should measure outcomes at the same key times, use similar definitions, and report side effects clearly.\n\nWhat is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\nAnaemia is when your blood has too little haemoglobin (Hb), which carries oxygen around your body. Iron deficiency anaemia happens when you do not have enough iron to make healthy red blood cells. During pregnancy, anaemia can make you feel tired, dizzy, or short of breath. In more serious cases it can increase the chance of problems for you and your baby.\n\nHow is anaemia in pregnancy treated?\nPeople with iron deficiency anaemia usually take iron by mouth as tablets or syrup (oral iron). Some people receive iron by a drip into a vein in the arm (intravenous iron). Intravenous iron gives a larger dose quickly, but it needs clinic or hospital care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether intravenous iron works better than iron tablets for pregnant people with iron deficiency anaemia. We looked at benefits (such as higher Hb and fewer people with anaemia) and unwanted effects (such as heavy bleeding after birth, blood transfusion, infections, and other side effects).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared intravenous iron with iron tablets in pregnant people with anaemia. We summarized the results across studies and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies, involving 3939 pregnant people with iron deficiency anaemia. Most studies took place in India and African countries. People joined the studies between 13 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, with Hb levels from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most common comparison was intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate. This review was partly funded by the World Health Organization and the UK Medical Research Council. The studies did not report maternal satisfaction or maternal well‑being.\n\nMain results\n- Intravenous iron probably slightly increases Hb three to six weeks after starting treatment, compared with iron tablets. It also probably reduces the number of people who still have anaemia at that time.\n- Around the time of birth, intravenous iron probably slightly increases Hb and probably reduces anaemia compared with iron tablets.\n- After birth, intravenous iron may slightly increase Hb and may reduce anaemia compared with iron tablets. Its effect on severe anaemia after birth is very uncertain.\n- Intravenous iron may make little to no difference to heavy bleeding after birth (postpartum haemorrhage), and it probably makes little to no difference to the need for a blood transfusion. Breastfeeding rates probably do not change with the type of iron.\n- We are very uncertain about the effect of intravenous iron on maternal deaths because these events were very rare. Intravenous iron probably does not increase severe infections or the chance of a longer hospital stay. It may not change admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). Intravenous iron probably does not increase general side effects and may not increase serious side effects, but studies reported side effects in different ways, which makes it hard to compare.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results varies. We are moderately confident about some findings (for example, Hb before birth and blood transfusion), but we have little confidence about others (for example, heavy bleeding after birth and serious harms). Reasons include: studies measured outcomes at different times and in different ways; many outcomes were rare or based on few events; some studies lost people to follow‑up; and side effects were reported inconsistently. This means some results could change when better studies are done.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
