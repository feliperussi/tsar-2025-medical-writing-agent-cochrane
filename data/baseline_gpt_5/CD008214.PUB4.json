    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo anti‑VEGF eye injections (medicines that shrink harmful new blood vessels) before or during vitrectomy help people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (a severe diabetic eye disease)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Anti‑VEGF eye injections given shortly before or during vitrectomy reduce some problems during and after surgery. They reduce late bleeding into the jelly of the eye after surgery, and reduce tears in the retina during surgery. They probably reduce early bleeding after surgery and may improve vision about 6 months after surgery. Reported side effects from the injections were rare. We did not find results on quality of life.\n- Looking at simple numbers from the studies: for every 100 people, early bleeding after surgery might drop from about 31 to about 12, and late bleeding after surgery might drop from about 23 to about 10. Tears in the retina during surgery might drop from about 31 to about 12. We are not sure whether injections change the need for silicone oil during surgery or the need for another surgery afterward.\n- Future research should use the same outcome measures, hide treatment group when possible, follow people for longer, and report quality of life and unwanted effects clearly so we can be more certain.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy?\nDiabetes can damage the back of the eye (the retina). In some people, new weak blood vessels grow on the retina. This is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These vessels can bleed into the clear jelly in the eye (the vitreous) and can pull on the retina, causing it to detach. This can harm sight and sometimes needs eye surgery.\n\nWhat is vitrectomy and why is it done?\nVitrectomy is an eye operation. The eye surgeon removes the cloudy jelly from inside the eye and treats bleeding and scar tissue. The surgeon may also repair a detached retina. Surgery can improve sight or stop it from getting worse. But problems can happen during or after surgery, such as bleeding, tears in the retina, or a new retinal detachment.\n\nWhat are anti‑VEGF eye injections?\nAnti‑VEGF medicines block a growth signal called VEGF. This helps shrink the harmful new blood vessels. Doctors can inject anti‑VEGF into the eye shortly before or during surgery. This may make surgery easier and reduce bleeding.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti‑VEGF injections before or during vitrectomy:\n- improves vision after surgery\n- reduces bleeding during and after surgery\n- lowers the need for extra surgeries\n- affects quality of life\nWe also looked for unwanted effects from the injections.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared vitrectomy with anti‑VEGF injections versus vitrectomy without these injections. We combined and summarized the results, and judged how much we can trust the evidence. Some studies randomly put people into groups (by chance) so the groups were similar.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 28 studies that looked at giving anti‑VEGF into the eye before or during vitrectomy for complications of severe diabetic eye disease, such as long‑lasting bleeding into the eye, a retinal detachment that involves the center of sight, or a mixed type of detachment. Together, the studies included 1914 eyes. The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Most results were measured around 6 months after surgery. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Vision after surgery: Anti‑VEGF may improve vision about 6 months after surgery.\n- Early bleeding after surgery (within 4 weeks): Anti‑VEGF probably reduces early bleeding. As an example, for every 100 people, early bleeding might drop from about 31 to about 12.\n- Late bleeding after surgery (after 4 weeks): Anti‑VEGF reduces late bleeding. For every 100 people, late bleeding might drop from about 23 to about 10.\n- Tears in the retina during surgery: Anti‑VEGF reduces the chance of tears during surgery. For every 100 people, this might drop from about 31 to about 12.\n- Extra surgery to clear bleeding: We are not sure if anti‑VEGF reduces the need for another surgery to clear bleeding after the first operation.\n- Extra surgery for a new retinal detachment: We do not know if anti‑VEGF reduces the need for surgery for a new retinal detachment after the first operation.\n- Need for silicone oil during surgery: We are not sure if anti‑VEGF changes the need for silicone oil during surgery. Some studies suggested fewer people needed it, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n- Quality of life: The studies did not report on quality of life.\n- Very poor vision: The studies did not report how many people ended up with very poor vision.\n\nUnwanted effects\nReported side effects from anti‑VEGF injections were rare in these studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that anti‑VEGF reduces late bleeding and tears in the retina during surgery. We are moderately confident that it reduces early bleeding. We have little confidence about effects on vision and on the need for more surgeries because many studies did not clearly explain how people were put into groups, and it is possible that people and doctors knew which treatment was given. For some outcomes there were few people and results varied, so we cannot be sure. We are not confident about the results for the need for silicone oil.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
