    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo self-management programs help adults with visual impairment (serious sight loss) live better and feel better?\n\nKey messages\n- Self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with serious sight loss. This applies to health-related quality of life (how you feel and function overall) and vision-related quality of life (how sight affects daily life), compared with wait list, usual care, or other active support. Harms were reported in few studies. Based on the limited information, these programs may make little to no difference to unwanted effects.\n- The programs and people in the studies were quite varied, and most people were older adults with age-related macular degeneration. We found no studies in people with both sight and hearing loss (dual sensory impairment).\n- Future research should include a wider range of people, report unwanted effects more clearly, use better tools to measure quality of life, and test program content more clearly so we know what works best.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why does it matter?\nVisual impairment means serious sight loss that makes daily tasks hard, such as reading, cooking, moving around, or recognizing faces. It mainly affects older adults, often because of age-related eye diseases like macular degeneration. Sight loss can affect mood, independence, social life, and overall well-being.\n\nWhat are self-management programs?\nSelf-management means learning skills to live as well as possible with a long-term condition. For sight loss, programs often include:\n- education about the eye condition and treatments\n- problem-solving and goal setting for daily tasks\n- training to use optical aids and other tools\n- practice of everyday skills to stay independent\n- emotional support and stress management\n- coaching or support from health professionals or peers\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with serious sight loss. We looked at:\n- health-related quality of life (how people feel and function overall)\n- vision-related quality of life (how sight affects daily life)\n- unwanted effects (harms), such as worsening mood or other problems\n- performance in vision-related daily living tasks\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with wait list, usual care, or other active support in adults with serious sight loss. We combined results when possible and judged how much confidence to place in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 20 studies with 3151 adults with serious sight loss. Most people were older adults, with average ages from about 60 to 84 years. Many had age-related macular degeneration. The studies took place in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, in hospitals, low-vision clinics, rehabilitation centers, private practices, and Veterans Affairs centers. One study had industry funding; most were funded by research grants or non-profit groups.\n\nThe programs were multifaceted and varied in their content and how they were delivered. Comparison groups included wait list, usual care, optical aids, or low-vision rehabilitation. We did not find any eligible studies that focused on people with both sight and hearing loss. Some studies measured outcomes over longer periods, up to about 24 months.\n\nMain results\n- Health-related quality of life: Self-management programs may make little to no difference to health-related quality of life compared with wait list, usual care, or other active support.\n- Vision-related quality of life: Self-management programs may make little to no difference to vision-related quality of life in the short term. This pattern also held in the longer term (about 6 to 24 months).\n- Unwanted effects (harms): Based on the limited information available, self-management programs may make little to no difference to the chance of unwanted effects during the study period. Few studies reported harms. In one study, more people in the program group were referred to a general practitioner for low mood than in the wait list group, but most studies reported no treatment-related harms.\n- Daily living performance: Some studies measured how well people performed daily tasks related to vision, but the review mainly reported quality of life results. There was not enough clear information to say whether these programs improve daily living performance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in these results because the studies were fairly small and their findings were not fully consistent. The programs and the people taking part also differed from study to study, which makes it harder to be sure about the true effect. In addition, few studies reported unwanted effects, and there were no studies in people with both sight and hearing loss. This means the results may not apply to everyone with serious sight loss.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024."
