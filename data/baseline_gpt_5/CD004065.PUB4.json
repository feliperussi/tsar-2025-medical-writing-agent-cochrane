    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and harms of corticosteroids and biologics (protein-based medicines that target the immune system) for eosinophilic esophagitis (long-term allergic inflammation of the food pipe)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Corticosteroids (usually swallowed steroid liquids or tablets designed to coat the food pipe) cause a large reduction in allergy-type cells in the food pipe tissue under the microscope. They may reduce symptoms slightly. They may or may not change what doctors see during endoscopy (a camera test). People stopped treatment because of side effects slightly less often with corticosteroids than with a dummy treatment (placebo). Side effects were not reported in detail in many studies.\n- Biologics (protein-based medicines that target parts of the immune system) probably cause a large reduction in these allergy-type cells in tissue. They may make little to no difference to symptoms when measured one way, but probably help symptoms when measured another way. They may make little to no difference to what doctors see during endoscopy. People stopped treatment because of side effects as often as with placebo. Detailed side effect reporting was limited.\n- We need more good-quality research that follows people for longer, compares medicines directly with each other and with diet changes, reports side effects and quality of life clearly, and studies both children and adults.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-lasting condition where allergy-type white blood cells called eosinophils build up in the food pipe (esophagus). This causes swelling and scarring. People may have trouble swallowing, chest pain, heartburn, or food getting stuck.\n\nDoctors diagnose EoE using symptoms plus a biopsy. A biopsy is a tiny tissue sample, taken during endoscopy, that is checked under a microscope.\n\nHow is eosinophilic esophagitis treated?\nThere is no cure yet, so most people need long-term care. Common options include:\n- diet changes, such as removing certain foods (food elimination diets)\n- proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), medicines that reduce stomach acid\n- corticosteroids, medicines that calm the immune system; in EoE they are swallowed to coat the food pipe\n- biologics (protein-based medicines that target parts of the immune system)\n- esophageal dilation, a procedure to gently stretch narrowed areas\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well medical treatments and food elimination diets work for EoE, and how safe they are. We looked at effects on:\n- symptoms\n- biopsy results (how many eosinophils are in the tissue)\n- endoscopy findings (what the food pipe looks like)\n- side effects and people stopping treatment because of side effects\n- quality of life\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to March 2023 that compared medicines or food elimination diets for EoE with another treatment or with a placebo. We combined the results and judged how confident we are in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 41 studies with 3253 people. Some studies included only children, and others included both children and adults. Most studies tested treatments for starting control of the disease (to bring it into remission). We focused on two main comparisons: corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nCorticosteroids versus placebo\n- Symptoms: Corticosteroids may reduce symptoms slightly. This means some people may feel a bit better, but the size of benefit in daily life may be small.\n- Biopsy results: Corticosteroids cause a large reduction in eosinophils in the food pipe tissue. This shows strong healing under the microscope.\n- Endoscopy findings: Corticosteroids may or may not improve what doctors see during endoscopy. Results varied depending on how studies measured this.\n- Stopping treatment because of side effects: People may stop treatment slightly less often with corticosteroids than with placebo.\n\nBiologics versus placebo\n- Symptoms: Biologics may make little to no difference when symptoms are measured one way. When measured another way, biologics probably reduce symptoms. This suggests some symptom benefit, but not in every measure.\n- Biopsy results: Biologics probably cause a large reduction in eosinophils in the food pipe tissue.\n- Endoscopy findings: Biologics may make little to no difference to what doctors see during endoscopy. For some ways of measuring this, we do not know if there is any benefit.\n- Stopping treatment because of side effects: People may stop treatment about as often with biologics as with placebo.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for people with EoE?\n- Corticosteroids clearly help the food pipe heal under the microscope. The benefit on symptoms is smaller, and the effect on the look of the food pipe is unclear.\n- Biologics likely help healing under the microscope and may help symptoms, but they may not change what doctors see during endoscopy.\n- Reports of side effects were limited. Stopping treatment because of side effects was similar with biologics and slightly less common with corticosteroids, compared with placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that corticosteroids cause a large reduction in eosinophils in the food pipe tissue in the short term. We are moderately confident that biologics probably reduce eosinophils a lot and probably help symptoms when measured in some ways. We have little confidence in many results about symptoms and endoscopy because studies were small, often short, and used different ways to measure improvement. For some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain. Many studies did not report side effects and quality of life in detail, which makes safety and day-to-day impact harder to judge.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
