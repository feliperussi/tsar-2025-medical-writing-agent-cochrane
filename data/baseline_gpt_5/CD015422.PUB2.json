    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo skin-applied mosquito repellents (topical repellents) help prevent malaria?\n\nKey Messages\n- Topical repellents (lotions or sprays applied to skin to keep mosquitoes away) may slightly reduce malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (the most dangerous malaria parasite), especially in people at higher risk who do not have other protection like mosquito nets or indoor spraying. In places where mosquito nets or indoor spraying are already used, the benefits were unclear. Unwanted effects were rare and mild, mainly skin irritation; serious harms were not reported.\n- Topical repellents may slightly lower how common P. falciparum infection is in a community. Our confidence in these findings is limited because the number of studies was small, study methods had issues, and results were only for P. falciparum.\n- More good-quality, larger studies are needed, especially in refugee camps and other high-risk groups without access to standard protections. Studies that assign treatments to individual people are also needed to show how much personal protection repellents give and whether mosquitoes then bite nearby people who are not protected.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is malaria and why does prevention matter?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by parasites that spread through mosquito bites. It can cause fever, chills, and can lead to severe illness or death. Preventing mosquito bites is a key way to stop malaria.\n\nHow is malaria usually prevented?\nMany people use long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). These are bed nets treated with insecticide that last a long time. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is another method where insecticide is sprayed on indoor walls to kill mosquitoes. These tools work best for mosquitoes that bite or rest indoors. They may not protect people who spend time outdoors at night or sleep outside.\n\nWhat are topical repellents?\nTopical repellents are creams, lotions, or sprays you put on your skin to keep mosquitoes away. They can help when people are outdoors or not using nets or indoor spraying.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if topical repellents, alone or together with nets or indoor spraying, reduce malaria infections and illness in people living in areas where malaria is common. We also looked at whether effects differ in higher-risk groups, such as refugees, forest workers, or military personnel.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where people used topical repellents, with or without nets or indoor spraying, and compared them with people who did not use repellents. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in these findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 8 trials and included 6 in our combined analysis. Some studies assigned whole groups (for example, communities or camps) to use repellents or not, and some assigned individual people. The studies included children and adults living in malaria-endemic regions, and several focused on high-risk groups such as refugees, forest goers, or military personnel. Two studies of malaria prevalence were done in refugee camps where people were not receiving nets or indoor spraying. The studies mainly measured infections with Plasmodium falciparum. The abstract did not report how long the studies lasted or who funded them.\n\nMain results\n- When we looked at infection and illness together, topical repellents may slightly reduce malaria caused by P. falciparum. Our confidence in this result is limited.\n- When we looked at infection alone or illness alone, it is unclear if topical repellents reduce malaria.\n- In studies of how common P. falciparum infection was in a community, topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of people who have parasites at a given time. This possible benefit was suggested in refugee camps where people did not have other protections.\n- Unwanted effects were uncommon. Out of every 100 people using repellents, about 1 reported mild skin irritation. Serious harms were not reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because study methods could have influenced the results. For example, people may have known which group they were in, and not all studies provided results for every outcome we cared about. There were not enough studies to be certain, and some studies may have been too small to show clear effects. Also, most results focused on P. falciparum, so they may not apply to other malaria parasites. In places where nets or indoor spraying are widely used, the studies did not show clear added benefit from repellents.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
