    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhich staff approaches reduce physical restraints (such as bedrails and belts) for older people in long‑term care?\n\nKey Messages\n- Programs in care homes that promote a “least‑restraint” policy probably reduce how often people are physically restrained, with a large drop in the use of belts. These programs probably do not change falls or the use of medicines that affect mood or behavior (psychotropic medicines). One study reported no serious harms, but most studies did not measure harms, so we cannot be sure.\n- Simple staff education programs on their own may not reduce restraints, and results were mixed. A program that gave staff information about people’s risk of falling may make little to no difference to restraint use. Some studies had problems, such as not measuring bedrails (the most common type of restraint) or having groups that were different at the start.\n- We need more good‑quality research, especially in people receiving care at home. Future studies should measure harms, include bedrails, make sure groups are similar at the start, and look at outcomes that matter to residents and families, such as comfort, injuries, and quality of life.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are physical restraints and why do they matter?\nPhysical restraints are devices or actions that limit a person’s movement. Examples include bedrails, belts on chairs, fixed tables, or tightly tucked sheets. They are often used in care homes. Many experts recommend avoiding them because they can cause harm, such as injury, distress, or reduced independence, and they do not clearly prevent falls.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which approaches help prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who need long‑term care, in care homes or at home in the community. We looked at benefits and unwanted effects, including serious harms, falls, injuries, quality of life, agitation (restlessness or distress), and use of psychotropic medicines (medicines that affect mood or behavior, like sedatives or antipsychotics).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested ways to prevent or reduce physical restraints for older people in long‑term care, compared with usual care. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 older people. All studies took place in long‑term residential care facilities (care homes). None were done in people’s homes. All studies included people with dementia (a long‑term condition that affects memory, thinking, and daily activities). The average age was about 85 years. Most comparison groups received usual care; in 2 studies they also received information materials about restraint reduction. Funding sources and study countries were not clearly reported.\n\nThe studies tested 3 types of staff approaches:\n- Organisational “least‑restraint” programs: These aim to change care home policies and culture to avoid restraints whenever possible. They included staff education, training “champions” who support good practice, and steps to change routines.\n- Simple staff education: These programs gave staff information and training about restraints. Some also included ward‑based guidance.\n- Fall‑risk information: One study gave staff regular information about each resident’s risk of falling.\n\nMain results:\n- Organisational “least‑restraint” programs probably reduce the number of people who are restrained at least once. They probably cause a large reduction in belt use for restraint. Based on one study, they probably reduce how long restraints are used. They probably make little to no difference to how many psychotropic medicines are prescribed. They may make little to no difference to falls, fall‑related injuries, or agitation. They make little to no difference to quality of life. Serious harms were rarely measured; one study reported none.\n- Simple staff education: We are uncertain whether these programs reduce restraint use because results were inconsistent and some studies had groups that were different at the start. These programs probably make little to no difference to how intense restraint use was. They may make little to no difference to falls, fall‑related injuries, or agitation. We are uncertain about their effect on prescriptions for psychotropic medicines. None of the studies reported serious harms, and one study did not assess bedrails.\n- Fall‑risk information for staff may make little to no difference to restraint use or falls. This study did not assess overall harms.\n\nThese results apply to care homes. We did not find studies from community or home settings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident about the findings for “least‑restraint” programs, but we have little confidence in the findings for simple education or fall‑risk information. Many studies had issues: some groups may not have been similar at the start; some outcomes were not measured or reported; serious harms were rarely assessed; and the research happened only in care homes, not at home. In addition, the education studies used different methods and sometimes did not measure common restraints like bedrails.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
