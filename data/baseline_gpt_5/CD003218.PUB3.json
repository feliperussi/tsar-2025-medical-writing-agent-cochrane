    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo psychostimulants (medicines that help people stay awake) help with daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) in adults with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nKey Messages\n- In adults with myotonic dystrophy who feel very sleepy in the daytime, psychostimulants (mostly modafinil) may reduce sleepiness slightly when people rate their own symptoms on a questionnaire. It is unclear if these medicines change results on lab sleep tests or improve quality of life. They may increase side effects. Harms were only reported for the short term.\n- The studies were small and short (up to 4 weeks) and only included adults. We do not know how well these medicines work or how safe they are with long-term use, or in children.\n- Future research should include larger, longer studies that compare different psychostimulants, track side effects and quality of life over time, and include children and teens where appropriate.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why can it cause daytime sleepiness?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a long-term genetic condition that affects muscles and other parts of the body. It causes muscle weakness and trouble relaxing muscles (this is called myotonia). Many people with myotonic dystrophy also feel very sleepy in the daytime. This is called hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness). Daytime sleepiness can make daily life difficult. It can affect school, work, driving, and relationships.\n\nWhat are psychostimulants?\nPsychostimulants are medicines that help people feel more awake. One common example is modafinil. Doctors sometimes use these medicines to try to reduce daytime sleepiness.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychostimulants help adults or children with myotonic dystrophy feel less sleepy in the daytime. We also wanted to know if these medicines affect quality of life and what side effects they cause.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychostimulants (such as modafinil) with a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment in people with myotonic dystrophy who had daytime sleepiness. We compared and summarized the results, and we judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with 136 adults aged 18 to 70 years. All people were seen as outpatients. The studies were short, lasting up to 4 weeks. Most of the evidence focused on modafinil. The studies compared psychostimulants with a placebo or no treatment. No study followed people for the long term, and none included children.\n\nThe studies used several ways to measure sleepiness:\n- Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): a short questionnaire where people rate how likely they are to doze off in daily situations.\n- Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT): a lab test that measures how long a person can stay awake while sitting quietly.\n- Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT): a lab test that measures how quickly a person falls asleep during several nap opportunities.\n- Quality of life: how people feel and function in daily life.\n\nMain results\n- Self-rated daytime sleepiness (ESS): Psychostimulants may reduce daytime sleepiness slightly. Most of the data were about modafinil. (We have little confidence in this result because the studies gave different results.)\n- Ability to stay awake in a lab (MWT): It is unclear if psychostimulants have an effect on how long people can stay awake during this test. (We are not confident in this result because the studies were small and gave mixed results.)\n- How quickly people fall asleep in a lab (MSLT): We do not know if psychostimulants change this. (We are not confident in this result because the studies were small and gave mixed results.)\n- Quality of life: We do not know if psychostimulants improve quality of life. (We are not confident in this result.)\n- Side effects: Psychostimulants may increase the chance of side effects in the short term. The studies did not clearly show which side effects were most common, and they did not look at long-term safety.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for people living with myotonic dystrophy?\nSome adults may feel a little less sleepy when taking a psychostimulant like modafinil for a few weeks. But lab tests that measure sleepiness did not clearly improve, and we do not know if peopleâ€™s quality of life gets better. These medicines may cause side effects. We do not know what happens with long-term use.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because the studies were small, lasted only up to 4 weeks, and often gave different results. The evidence was mainly about modafinil and did not include children. The studies did not report long-term effects or long-term safety. Because of these gaps, the true benefits and harms may be different from what we saw in these short studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
