    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs folding a thin inner retinal layer over the hole (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) better than standard peeling during eye surgery for large macular holes (a small opening in the center of the retina)?\n\nKey messages\n- The inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique probably increases the chance that a large macular hole closes fully. It may also improve vision 3 months or more after surgery. It is unclear if it improves vision 1 month after surgery. Unwanted effects were rarely reported, so we cannot tell whether one method is safer than the other.\n- These findings mostly apply to older adults with large idiopathic macular holes (holes that happen without a clear cause). We did not find studies of holes caused by injury (traumatic) or severe short-sightedness (myopia).\n- Future research should include larger, longer studies that report vision in the same way for everyone, and that carefully track unwanted effects. This will help people and eye doctors understand benefits and harms more clearly.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?\nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness opening in the macula. The macula is the center of the retina, the light‑sensitive layer at the back of your eye. You use the macula for sharp, straight‑ahead vision, like reading or seeing faces. A large macular hole means the opening is wide. Large holes are harder to close and often cause bigger vision problems.\n\nHow are large macular holes treated?\nMany people have eye surgery called pars plana vitrectomy. In this surgery, the surgeon removes the gel inside the eye (the vitreous) and works on the retina. Surgeons often remove a very thin inner layer of the retina called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Removing this layer is called “peeling.” Another method is the “inverted ILM flap.” In this method, the surgeon gently peels and then folds a small piece of this layer over the hole like a patch, instead of removing it completely.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether vitrectomy with an inverted ILM flap works better and is as safe as vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling for people with large macular holes. We looked at two main outcomes: how much people’s vision improved after surgery, and whether the hole closed. We also looked for any unwanted effects from surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these two surgical methods for large macular holes. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies with 285 eyes from 275 people. Most people were women and older adults (average ages about 59 to 66 years). The studies took place in India, Poland, and Mexico. The longest follow‑up was up to 12 months, and some studies followed people for only 3 months. Some people had cataract surgery at the same time as their vitrectomy, and others had cataract surgery later. The studies did not report receiving company funding, and none reported conflicts of interest.\n\nAll 4 studies included people with large idiopathic macular holes. We did not find studies that focused on holes from eye injury or from very high short‑sightedness. The surgical steps were mostly similar across studies.\n\nMain results\n- Vision after surgery: We do not know if the inverted ILM flap improves vision at 1 month compared with standard peeling. The findings for this early time point were very uncertain. At 3 months or later, the inverted ILM flap may improve vision compared with standard peeling.\n- Hole closure: The inverted ILM flap probably increases the chance that the macular hole closes. It also probably increases the chance of a “type 1” closure. Type 1 closure means the hole closes completely and the center of the retina lies flat, which is generally considered a better healing pattern.\n- Unwanted effects: Only one study reported on retinal detachment after surgery and found none in the people studied. Other unwanted effects were not well reported, so we cannot compare safety between the two methods.\n\nWhat do these results mean for people with large macular holes?\nIf you have a large macular hole, using an inverted ILM flap during vitrectomy probably gives a higher chance that the hole will close fully. Your vision may also improve more by 3 months or later, but we do not know about very early vision changes at 1 month. Because unwanted effects were not well reported, we cannot tell whether one method is safer.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident that the inverted ILM flap increases hole closure because results were consistent across studies. However, we have little confidence in the findings about vision, especially at early time points, because the studies were small, measured vision in different ways or reported it incompletely, and people checking the results may have known which surgery was done. Results may not apply to holes from eye injury or severe short‑sightedness, and follow‑up was short in some studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
