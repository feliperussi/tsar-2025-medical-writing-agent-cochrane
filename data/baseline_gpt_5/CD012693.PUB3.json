    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes choosing the FSH dose using ovarian reserve tests (tests that estimate egg supply) help women having IVF/ICSI (lab-based fertility treatments)?\n\nKey Messages\n– Using ovarian reserve tests to set the starting FSH dose did not clearly change the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. It may lower the chance of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; a reaction to fertility medicines where the ovaries swell and fluid can build up). We could not tell whether it changed the chance of severe OHSS.\n– When women were grouped as predicted low, normal, or high responders, giving higher or lower FSH doses may make little to no difference to live birth or ongoing pregnancy. We are uncertain about effects on OHSS because there were few cases.\n– We did not find enough good-quality evidence to show which dosing algorithm works best or which women benefit most. Future studies should test clear dosing plans, measure live birth and OHSS, and report costs.\n\nWhat are IVF and ICSI, and why is FSH used?\nIVF (in vitro fertilisation) joins eggs and sperm in the lab. ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) is when a single sperm is injected into an egg. Before egg collection, women take follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is a hormone medicine that helps the ovaries grow several eggs at once.\n\nGetting a “normal” response (about 5 to 15 eggs) is often the goal. A very strong response can raise the risk of OHSS. A weak response can lead to few eggs and may cause the cycle to be stopped.\n\nWhat are ovarian reserve tests?\nOvarian reserve tests estimate how many eggs a woman may have left. Common tests include:\n– anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH): a blood test that reflects egg supply\n– antral follicle count (AFC): the number of small egg sacs seen on ultrasound\n– basal FSH (bFSH): a blood test done early in the menstrual cycle\n\nClinicians sometimes use these tests to choose the starting FSH dose. The hope is to avoid too high or too low responses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if choosing the FSH dose using ovarian reserve tests improves results for women having IVF or ICSI. We focused on live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and on unwanted effects such as OHSS.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared dosing based on AMH, AFC, or basal FSH with standard dosing, and studies that compared different FSH doses for women predicted to respond low, normal, or high. We summarized the findings and judged how much confidence we can place in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies with 8520 women. Some studies used a dosing plan based on ovarian reserve tests and compared it with giving the same starting dose to everyone. Others compared higher or lower doses within groups predicted to be low, normal, or high responders. Studies took place in different countries and used different dosing plans. Some studies randomly placed women into the dosing groups to keep the groups similar. The main outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and OHSS. The abstract did not report funding sources.\n\nMain results\n– Ovarian reserve test (ORT) algorithms versus standard dosing (usually 150 IU FSH):\nIt is unclear if using an ORT-based dosing plan increases live birth or ongoing pregnancy. ORT-based dosing may reduce moderate or severe OHSS. We could not tell whether it changed severe OHSS.\n\nTo make this more concrete:\nIf 25 of 100 women have a live birth with a standard starting dose, then with ORT-based dosing about 25 to 31 of 100 may have a live birth. If 5 of 100 women have moderate or severe OHSS with a standard starting dose, then with ORT-based dosing about 2 to 5 of 100 may have moderate or severe OHSS. These ranges should be treated cautiously because the dosing plans differed across studies.\n\n– Predicted low responders:\nIt is unclear if higher FSH doses increase live birth or ongoing pregnancy, or change the chance of OHSS or clinical pregnancy. The results were very uncertain.\n\n– Predicted normal responders:\nHigher FSH doses may make little to no difference to live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and may make little to no difference to clinical pregnancy. There were too few OHSS cases to be sure about harms.\n\n– Predicted high responders:\nLower FSH doses may or may not change live birth or ongoing pregnancy. It is unclear whether lower doses reduce moderate or severe OHSS.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, and people may have known which dosing plan they received. The studies used different dosing plans and included different types of women, which makes results harder to compare. There were not enough OHSS cases to be certain about harms. We also could not tell which subgroup of women, if any, benefits most.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
