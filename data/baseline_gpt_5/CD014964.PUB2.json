    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing medicine near the spine) better than using body landmarks in adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- Using ultrasound to guide the needle reduces how many needle tries are needed and reduces the time the needle is in the skin. It probably makes first‑try success more likely. We do not know if ultrasound changes unwanted effects (such as headache, bleeding, low blood pressure, or nerve problems) because these were not well reported and the results were very uncertain.\n- Ultrasound may make little to no difference to how satisfied people feel during the procedure or to the chance that the procedure cannot be completed as planned.\n- Future studies should report harms and pain in a clear and consistent way, compare different ways of using ultrasound, and include a wide range of people. Larger, well‑designed studies that use the same measures for satisfaction and pain would help.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia and why can it be hard to do?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is numbing medicine placed near the spinal cord to block pain in part of the body. Common types are spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia. Doctors often use these for surgery on the lower body and for pain relief during labour and caesarean birth.\n\nPlacing the needle in the right spot matters. Many clinicians find the spot by feeling bones and skin folds on the back. These are called anatomical landmarks. But what you feel on the outside does not always match the exact spot inside the spine. If the first try misses, it can take several tries. More tries can mean more pain, longer time, and sometimes more problems.\n\nWhat is ultrasound guidance?\nUltrasound uses sound waves to make pictures inside the body. For neuraxial anaesthesia, clinicians can use ultrasound before starting or in real time to see where the spaces and bones are. This may help them choose the best spot and angle for the needle.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural procedures works better and is safer than using body landmarks alone. We looked at:\n- how many needle tries it took\n- how long the procedure took\n- first‑try success\n- whether the procedure had to be stopped or changed\n- how much pain people felt during the procedure\n- how satisfied people felt\n- unwanted effects (harms), like headache after the procedure, bleeding, infection, nerve problems, and so on\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared ultrasound with body landmarks for adults having neuraxial anaesthesia. We combined the results and judged how confident we are in them, based on how the studies were done and how big they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 65 studies with 6823 adults from many parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. The studies were published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the studies were in people giving birth (labour epidurals or caesarean sections). The rest were in people having surgery with spinal or epidural anaesthesia. The studies covered spinal anaesthesia, lumbar epidural anaesthesia, combined spinal‑epidural, and a few thoracic epidurals. Some studies used ultrasound before the procedure to mark the skin. A few used ultrasound in real time while placing the needle. Different studies used different scales to measure satisfaction. The review team reported no funding for the review; funding for the included studies was not detailed.\n\nMain results\n- Compared with feeling for body landmarks, using ultrasound reduces the number of needle tries needed to complete the procedure. It also reduces the time the needle is in the skin.\n- Using ultrasound probably increases the chance that the clinician succeeds on the first try.\n- Using ultrasound may make little to no difference to how satisfied people feel during the procedure.\n- Using ultrasound may make little to no difference to the chance that the procedure cannot be completed as planned.\n- It is unclear if using ultrasound changes pain during the procedure. We are very uncertain about these results.\n- It is unclear if using ultrasound changes unwanted effects such as headache after the procedure, bleeding, infection, nerve problems, or low blood pressure. We are very uncertain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident about the findings on fewer needle tries, shorter procedure time, and better first‑try success. We have less confidence about satisfaction and technical failure because studies used different ways to measure satisfaction and not all studies reported everything we needed. We are not confident about pain and harms because studies were small, there were few events, and reporting of harms was limited. The studies also used ultrasound in different ways (before the procedure versus in real time), and people in the studies and their clinicians often knew which method they were getting, which can affect reports of pain and satisfaction.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023."
