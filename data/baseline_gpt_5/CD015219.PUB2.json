    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes favipiravir (an antiviral medicine that aims to stop the virus multiplying) help treat COVID-19?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if favipiravir helps people with COVID-19 live longer, recover faster, or avoid a breathing machine (invasive mechanical ventilation). It may make little to no difference to being admitted to hospital or needing oxygen. Favipiravir may increase non-serious side effects, while serious harms were similar to usual care or a dummy tablet (placebo).\n- Most studies included adults under 60 years, mainly in hospital with mild to moderate illness. Doses and treatment length varied, and favipiravir was usually compared with usual care or a dummy tablet; a few studies compared it with other antiviral medicines.\n- Future research should include older people and those treated at home, use consistent dosing, and focus on outcomes that matter to patients, such as survival, need for a breathing machine, time to recovery, and clear reporting of side effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and what is favipiravir?\nCOVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus. Some people have mild symptoms, while others become very unwell and need oxygen or a breathing machine. An “acute condition” is a condition that develops suddenly and lasts a short time. Acute COVID-19 means recent infection.\n\nFavipiravir is an antiviral medicine. Antiviral medicines aim to stop viruses from copying themselves in the body. Some experts suggested favipiravir might help people with COVID-19.\n\nWhy consider favipiravir for COVID-19?\nIf favipiravir slows the virus, people might recover faster or be less likely to get worse. It could help keep people out of hospital, lower the need for oxygen or a breathing machine, and reduce deaths. It could also cause unwanted effects (side effects), so we looked at harms as well as benefits.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if favipiravir, compared with no medicine, usual care, a dummy tablet, or other antiviral medicines:\n- helps people live longer\n- reduces the need for a breathing machine or oxygen\n- keeps people out of hospital\n- helps people feel better sooner\n- causes any unwanted effects, including serious harms\n\n[Optional] How is COVID-19 treated?\nTreatment depends on how sick someone is. Options can include:\n- rest, fluids, fever medicines, and monitoring at home\n- oxygen and hospital care for people with breathing problems\n- antiviral medicines that target the virus\n- anti-inflammatory medicines (such as steroids) for people with more severe illness\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to July 2023 that tested favipiravir for people with COVID-19. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we could place in the evidence, based on study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 studies with 5750 adults who had COVID-19. Most people were younger than 60 years. Most were in hospital with mild to moderate illness. The studies took place in many countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Favipiravir was usually compared with usual care or a dummy tablet. A few studies compared favipiravir with other antiviral medicines (lopinavir/ritonavir or umifenovir). Most studies started with a higher dose on day 1, then used a lower dose for 5 to 14 days. The abstract did not report how the studies were funded.\n\nMain results:\n- Death from any cause: It is unclear if favipiravir has an effect on deaths. We do not know whether it reduces or increases the chance of dying from COVID-19.\n- Need for a breathing machine (invasive mechanical ventilation): It is unclear if favipiravir has an effect on the need for a breathing machine.\n- Hospital admission (for people starting out of hospital): Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the chance of being admitted to hospital.\n- Time to clinical improvement (how quickly people feel better): It is unclear if favipiravir changes the time it takes to feel better.\n- Need for oxygen: Favipiravir may make little to no difference to whether people go on to need oxygen.\n- Unwanted effects (side effects): Favipiravir may increase non-serious side effects. It may make little to no difference to serious harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence for most outcomes. Many studies were small, and different studies used different dosing schedules and measured outcomes in different ways. Most people were under 60 years and in hospital with mild to moderate illness, so we do not know how well the findings apply to older people, those with severe illness, or people treated at home. For several important outcomes, there were not enough clear data to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023."
