    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo psychological treatments (talk therapy, education, and relaxation) help people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?\n\nKey Messages\n- In adults with IBD, psychological treatments probably improve quality of life a little and probably reduce depression and anxiety a little. They may make little to no difference to gut disease activity (how active the bowel inflammation is). The studies did not report unwanted effects from these treatments.\n- In children and teens with IBD, talk therapy probably improves quality of life. We do not know if these treatments help anxiety, depression, or disease activity in children and teens. In adults, talk therapy, patient education (learning about IBD and self‑management), and relaxation exercises each probably bring small, short‑term benefits for well‑being.\n- Future research should use more consistent methods, include more children and teens, measure disease activity and any unwanted effects, compare different types of therapy, and follow people for longer.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and why can it affect mental health?\nIBD is a long-term condition (a chronic condition) that causes inflammation in the gut. The 2 main types are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD can cause belly pain, diarrhea, tiredness, and weight loss. Living with IBD can be stressful and worrying. People with IBD are more likely to have depression and anxiety. Mental health and IBD can affect each other in both directions.\n\nWhat are psychological treatments?\nPsychological treatments focus on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. They include:\n- talk therapy (psychotherapy), such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), where you work with a therapist to learn coping skills\n- patient education, which teaches you about IBD and how to manage it\n- relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises, meditation, or muscle relaxation\n\nThese treatments aim to improve quality of life (how you feel and function in daily life), mood, and coping. They might also affect disease activity (how active the bowel inflammation is).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological treatments help people with IBD to:\n- feel better in daily life (quality of life)\n- reduce depression and anxiety\n- change the level of gut inflammation (disease activity)\nWe looked at effects in both adults and in children and teens.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where people with IBD were placed by chance into different groups (randomly assigned) to receive a psychological treatment or another approach, such as usual care. We compared and summarized the results and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 68 studies. Of these, 48 studies reported enough details to combine their results. These 48 studies included 6111 adults and 294 children and teens. The studies compared talk therapy, patient education, or relaxation with usual medical care, a sham treatment (a simulated intervention), or another active treatment. Most programs combined more than one element, such as education plus relaxation. The shortest follow-up was 2 months. The abstract did not report where the studies took place or who funded them.\n\nMain results\n\nAdults\n- Talk therapy compared with usual medical care (care-as-usual, which means the regular IBD care you would normally receive) probably improves quality of life a little, and probably reduces depression and anxiety a little, at least in the short term (during or soon after treatment).\n- Patient education may improve quality of life slightly and may reduce depression and anxiety slightly in the short term. Education may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n- Relaxation techniques probably improve quality of life a little, and probably reduce depression and anxiety a little in the short term.\n- We do not know if psychological treatments change disease activity in adults. Results were mixed and could not be combined in a clear way.\n\nChildren and teens\n- Talk therapy probably improves quality of life.\n- We do not know if talk therapy reduces anxiety or depression, because results were unclear and based on few people.\n- For patient education, we found only one small study. It suggests education might help quality of life, but we do not know if it helps depression. Anxiety and disease activity were not measured.\n- For relaxation, we do not know if it helps, because the results were unclear.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for people with IBD?\nIf you are an adult with IBD, psychological treatments are likely to help you feel a bit better in daily life and may help with mood and anxiety. These benefits seem small but can still matter to some people. These treatments may not change how active the gut inflammation is. For children and teens, talk therapy likely helps quality of life, but we need better studies to know more about mood, anxiety, and disease activity. The studies did not report unwanted effects, so we do not know if there are any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident that psychological treatments help adults with quality of life, depression, and anxiety, because several studies showed similar small benefits. However, our confidence is lower for disease activity and for children and teens because:\n- people in the studies could not be kept unaware of which treatment they were getting\n- many outcomes were based on people’s reports, which can be influenced by expectations\n- studies used different types of therapies and combinations, making them hard to compare\n- some studies were small, and there were not enough studies in children and teens\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
