    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the ways to deliver eye tests and glasses (refractive and optical care) in community and primary care settings?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found many ways to provide eye tests and glasses outside hospitals, such as school-based and outreach services in the community, and vision centers in primary care. However, few studies measured benefits or harms, so we cannot tell which approach works better or whether any approach has unwanted effects. Harms were not reported.\n- Approaches varied by region. School-based and outreach services were common in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region, outreach was common in the Americas, and very few approaches were reported in the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n- Future research should compare these approaches and measure outcomes that matter to people, such as access to care, vision improvement, cost, convenience, and fairness. Studies should also report any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is refractive and optical care?\nRefractive error means your eye does not focus light properly, so vision is blurry. This includes near-sightedness, far-sightedness, and astigmatism. Most refractive errors can be corrected with the right glasses. Refractive care is the eye test to find your prescription. Optical care is making and providing the glasses.\n\nWhy bring eye tests and glasses into the community and primary care?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. Many people who need glasses do not have them, often because services are too far away or too costly. The World Health Organization has encouraged countries to increase access to testing and glasses. Services in community and primary care settings can bring care closer to where people live, study, and work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to describe the different ways that eye tests and glasses are delivered in community settings (such as schools, pharmacies, and outreach) and in primary care settings (such as health centers and vision centers). We also wanted to learn how these approaches were evaluated.\n\n[Optional] How are refractive errors checked and treated?\n- Eye examination to check vision and find the right lens power\n- Glasses made and provided based on the prescription\n- Referral to an eye specialist for complex cases, if needed\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched research databases, organization websites, and reports (from 2002 to November 2022) for studies and documents about delivering eye tests and glasses in community and primary care. We summarized what we found and assessed how strong and complete the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 175 studies, plus many records from company reports and organization websites that met our criteria. In community settings, the main approaches were school-based services, pharmacy-based services, and outreach (teams bringing services into towns and villages). In primary care, the main approaches were vision centers (clinics focused on eye care), health centers, and mixed models, such as a center combined with door-to-door delivery.\n\nSchool-based and outreach approaches were the most common in community care. Vision centers were the most common in primary care. In the WHO African region, school-based and outreach approaches were often reported. In the Americas, outreach was the approach most often described. Very few approaches were reported in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nMost documents described how services were set up and delivered. Only a small number of studies tried to evaluate how well the approaches worked. For example, few studies measured whether these services increased the number of people getting tested, receiving glasses, or seeing better after getting care. Few studies reported costs, convenience, or fairness for different groups. We did not find reports of unwanted effects, such as people getting the wrong glasses or delays in care.\n\nMain results\n- It is unclear if school-based services increase access to testing and glasses compared with other community approaches, because few studies measured these outcomes.\n- It is unclear if outreach services increase access or improve vision more than other models, because evaluations were limited.\n- It is unclear if vision centers in primary care improve access or vision more than other primary care approaches, because few studies compared outcomes across models.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings about benefits and harms because few studies evaluated outcomes, many sources were descriptive reports rather than research studies, and studies often involved small numbers or narrow settings. The approaches differed across regions and types of people, which makes it hard to compare them directly. The evidence did not cover all regions or all groups we were interested in. Some information came from organization websites and company reports, which may highlight successes more than problems.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\nFunding\nThe review was supported by the World Health Organization Vision and Eye Care Programme and the ATscale Global Partnership."
