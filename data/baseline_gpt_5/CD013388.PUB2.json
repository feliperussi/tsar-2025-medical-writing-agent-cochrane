    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes cognitive rehabilitation (a personal program to help with daily tasks) help people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey Messages\n- Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia reach their own daily activity goals. It leads to a large improvement by the end of the program, and this benefit lasts for several months. Some other effects were small, and a few measures suggested small worsening in some areas. The studies did not report medical side effects.\n- For people with dementia, cognitive rehabilitation slightly improves confidence to manage tasks and some types of memory and attention, but it probably makes overall daily functioning slightly worse several months later, and may slightly worsen anxiety and some aspects of memory. For care partners, it may slightly help some parts of quality of life during the program but may slightly worsen mood and wellbeing; several months later, it causes small improvements in social quality of life and probably small improvements in psychological quality of life.\n- More good-quality studies are needed. Future studies should look at who benefits most, which parts of the program work best, and whether benefits extend to everyday functioning and wellbeing beyond the set goals.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is dementia and why does daily living matter?\nDementia is a long-term condition that affects memory, thinking, and problem-solving. People with dementia may struggle with everyday activities, such as making a cup of tea, managing medicines, using a phone, or finding their way. Staying independent with daily tasks can improve dignity, safety, and quality of life for the person and may ease pressure on care partners, family, and friends.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation?\nCognitive rehabilitation is a one-to-one, goal-based program. A therapist works with the person with dementia (and often their care partner) to choose a few meaningful daily goals, like remembering appointments or using the bus. Together they plan and practice practical strategies, such as checklists, alarms, labels, or step-by-step routines, to improve performance in those chosen tasks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities and keep independence. We also looked at other outcomes, such as memory, attention, mood, and quality of life, and outcomes for care partners. We aimed to explore which factors might affect how well cognitive rehabilitation works.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where people with mild to moderate dementia received cognitive rehabilitation and were compared with usual care or another inactive approach. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nAbout the studies\nWe found 6 studies published between 2010 and 2022, with 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. Most people were in their late 70s. Where the type of dementia was reported, most had Alzheimer’s disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care or another inactive approach. Results at the end of treatment and again 3 to 12 months later were reported. One large, well-run study had a big influence on the findings. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results for people with dementia\n- Everyday functioning based on personal goals: Cognitive rehabilitation causes a large improvement in reaching personal daily goals by the end of the program. This improvement also lasts several months after the program ends.\n- Confidence to manage tasks (self-efficacy) and immediate memory: By the end of the program, cognitive rehabilitation reduces difficulties slightly in these areas.\n- Attention and general daily functioning several months later: Cognitive rehabilitation probably improves the ability to focus on one sound while ignoring others (auditory selective attention) slightly. However, it probably makes overall daily functioning slightly worse several months later.\n- Other thinking and mood measures several months later: Cognitive rehabilitation may slightly improve the ability to stay focused over time (sustained attention), but may slightly worsen anxiety and some aspects of memory.\n- Many other outcomes, such as overall quality of life, delayed recall, and word-finding, showed little to no difference at the end of treatment or at several months’ follow-up.\n\nMain results for care partners\n- During the program: Cognitive rehabilitation may slightly improve environmental aspects of quality of life (for example, safety and access to services), but may slightly worsen depression and psychological wellbeing for care partners.\n- Several months after the program: Cognitive rehabilitation causes a small improvement in the social aspects of care partners’ quality of life and probably causes a small improvement in psychological aspects of quality of life.\n- Other outcomes, including physical health, stress, and some quality of life areas, showed little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that cognitive rehabilitation helps people achieve their own daily goals. However, our confidence in other results is lower. People and therapists knew which treatment they received, which is hard to avoid for this kind of program. There were only a few studies for some outcomes, and some were small. Results were strongly influenced by one large study. Also, most people had Alzheimer’s disease, so we do not know if the findings are the same for all types of dementia. These issues mean that some benefits or harms outside the chosen goals could be larger or smaller than shown here.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
