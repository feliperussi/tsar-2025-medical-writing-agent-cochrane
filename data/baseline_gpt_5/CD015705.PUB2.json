    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and drawbacks when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones (smartphones) and other mobile devices (like tablets) for work?\n\nKey Messages\n– Using personal mobile phones and devices can help healthcare workers respond quickly, make care feel more personal, and stay in touch with patients and colleagues. However, it can also bring unwanted effects, such as extra costs to workers, pressure to be available after hours, privacy risks for patient information, and distractions at work.\n– These informal solutions often fill gaps where official systems are weak or slow. But they may also deepen unfairness between workers and patients, for example if only some people can afford data or have reliable electricity and internet. Most reports focused on mobile phones rather than tablets.\n– We are moderately to highly confident that these themes are common across many places. Future research should explore how health services can keep the benefits while reducing the harms, and include more settings, devices, and practical ways to protect patient privacy.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is informal mobile phone use in healthcare?\nHealthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones and devices for work in ways that their workplace does not regulate. For example, they may call or message patients, share photos or test results with colleagues, or store notes on their phones. People often do this when official systems for communication and record‐keeping are slow, hard to use, or unavailable.\n\nWhy does this matter?\nInformal phone use can help care feel more human and flexible. It can make it easier to get advice fast and to follow up with patients. But it can also create new problems. These include costs for workers, pressure to be available at home, and risks to privacy when patient information is stored or shared outside official systems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand how healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals view and use personal mobile phones and devices for work. We looked for what helps, what harms, and how these choices affect patients, workers, and health services.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for and summarized studies published since 2008 that reported people’s views and experiences of using personal mobile phones and devices for healthcare work. We combined the themes across studies and rated how confident we were in the key findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. They came from countries with high, middle, and low incomes, and covered many types of healthcare settings and workers. Most reports described mobile phone use rather than other devices like tablets. The studies focused on how people used their own phones, time, and social networks to support work. The abstract did not report how studies were funded.\n\nMain results\nHealthcare workers often face a gap between what their jobs expect and the tools they have. To fill this gap, many use their own phones, data, and airtime. They also use their personal time, such as taking calls after hours, and their own social networks to get help and advice. We are moderately to highly confident in these themes.\n\nIn some places, personal phone use has become a normal part of work, even though it is not officially regulated. Some workers feel pressure from colleagues and managers to use their own phones. Others feel a strong sense of duty to patients and keep using their phones at work and at home.\n\nPersonal phone use can help humanize care. It can make healthcare more flexible and responsive. It can give patients direct access to a known person rather than a general number. It can let workers share information with colleagues in ways that feel personal and socially appropriate. These features can strengthen trust and relationships with patients, families, and teams.\n\nHowever, there are clear drawbacks. Using personal phones costs money, which is harder for lower‐paid workers or those in low‐income settings. Being contacted after hours can be stressful, and lower‐level workers may feel less able to ignore calls at home. Workers without reliable electricity or internet cannot use these solutions as easily. People who lack skills to judge online information may struggle to find trustworthy sources. Workers with strong personal networks may get more help, while others may miss out.\n\nThere can also be downsides for patients. Storing or sharing patient information on personal phones may break confidentiality, which means keeping patient information private. Workers may choose to use their personal resources for patients they feel are most in need or “deserving,” based on their own values. This can lead to uneven support that does not match the rules or goals of the health system.\n\nInformal phone use can also weaken health systems. When information is kept on personal phones or shared through informal channels, it can create a “shadow IT” system. This means important information about patient flow or logistics sits outside official records. Personal devices can also be distracting, for example if social media or personal calls interrupt work. These problems may be harder in weaker health systems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately to highly confident in the themes because similar patterns appeared across many places and types of workers. However, this review is based on qualitative studies, which describe people’s views and experiences rather than how common an effect is. Most reports focused on mobile phones rather than other devices, so we cannot say as much about tablets and similar tools. Findings may not apply in the same way to all settings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
