    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo psychedelic-assisted therapy (psychedelics are substances that can change perception and mood) help with anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‑threatening diseases?\n\nKey Messages\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin or LSD may reduce anxiety and depression over the first few weeks for some adults with life‑threatening diseases. We do not know if it helps with existential distress (feelings of hopelessness, loss of meaning, or fear of dying). There were no serious treatment‑related harms reported in the included studies. Mild to moderate effects were common, such as raised blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, emotional distress, and unusual perceptions that people knew were not real. For MDMA (also known as Ecstasy), we do not know if it helps anxiety or depression.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if this therapy improves quality of life or spirituality in a reliable way. Some people described the experience as spiritually meaningful, but our confidence in these results is very limited.\n- More and larger studies are needed. Future research should reduce the chance that people can tell which treatment they received, use active placebos, and track benefits and harms that matter to patients over longer time periods.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy combines a supervised session with a psychedelic medicine and supportive therapy. Therapists prepare people before the session and help them make sense of the experience afterward. Common “classical psychedelics” include psilocybin (often called magic mushrooms) and LSD. Another medicine studied is MDMA (known as Ecstasy).\n\nWhy are anxiety, depression, and existential distress important in serious illness?\nPeople living with life‑threatening diseases, such as cancer, often struggle with anxiety and depression. Many also face existential distress. This means deep feelings about the meaning of life, hopelessness, or fear of dying. These feelings can affect everyday life, relationships, and comfort.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether psychedelic-assisted therapy helps reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in adults with serious illnesses. We also looked at possible harms and effects on quality of life and spirituality (personal sense of meaning or connection).\n\n[Optional] How is this therapy given?\n- Preparatory therapy sessions\n- A supervised session with a psychedelic medicine\n- Follow‑up “integration” therapy to help process the experience\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy with placebo or very low‑dose placebo. We summarized the results and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with 149 adults; results were analyzed for 140 people. The studies took place in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. Most people were between 36 and 64 years old. The studies lasted 6 to 12 months, but most main results were measured in the first 1 to 12 weeks. Two types of therapy were studied: classical psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) and MDMA. Drug companies did not fund the studies. Funding came from organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy.\n\nMain results\n- Anxiety (1 to 12 weeks): Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin or LSD may reduce anxiety compared with active placebo or very low‑dose psychedelic. For MDMA, it is unclear if it reduces anxiety.\n- Depression (1 to 12 weeks): Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin or LSD may reduce depression compared with active placebo or very low‑dose psychedelic. For MDMA, it is unclear if it reduces depression.\n- Existential distress (1 to 12 weeks): It is unclear if psilocybin or LSD reduce existential distress. Evidence from different measures was mixed, and one small study suggested possible benefit for demoralization (a common measure of existential distress), but we are very uncertain about this. MDMA was not studied for existential distress.\n- Quality of life (1 to 12 weeks): It is unclear if psilocybin or LSD improve quality of life. For MDMA, it is also unclear.\n- Spirituality (1 to 12 weeks): Some people who received psilocybin or LSD rated their experiences as spiritually significant. However, we are very uncertain about this, and MDMA was not assessed for spirituality.\n- Harms: No serious treatment‑related harms were reported. With psilocybin or LSD, common mild to moderate effects were raised blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, emotional distress, and unusual perceptions while knowing they were not real. With MDMA, common effects were anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches. These symptoms faded as the medicine’s effects wore off or within about a week. Psychedelic medicines are illegal in many countries, which affects access and research.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is likely that many people could tell which treatment they received, even when the studies tried to hide it. Also, the studies were small and few, which makes the results less certain. Some funding came from groups that promote this therapy, which may influence how research is planned and reported.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
