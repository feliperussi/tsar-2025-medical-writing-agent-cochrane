    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) prevent and stop tooth decay?\n\nKey Messages\n- Compared with no treatment or a dummy treatment (placebo), silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new decay on tooth roots (root caries, which often affects older adults). SDF may help stop existing decay from getting worse in children’s teeth (primary teeth), but we do not know if it prevents new decay on the biting surfaces of adult teeth (permanent teeth). Reports of unwanted effects and changes in tooth appearance (for example, black staining) were poor, so we cannot tell how often these happen.\n- When SDF was compared with fluoride varnish (a thin fluoride coating painted on teeth), SDF may make little to no difference for preventing new decay in children’s teeth. For other outcomes and for adult teeth, we do not know which works better.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know the best way to use SDF (such as how strong it should be, how often to apply it, or for how long), or how SDF compares with sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment (ART). Better studies should measure tooth staining, pain or sensitivity, and other unwanted effects, and follow people for longer.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is tooth decay (dental caries) and why does it matter?\nTooth decay (dental caries) is damage caused by bacteria and sugars that wear away tooth surfaces and can make holes. Decay can cause pain and can affect eating, sleep, school or work, and wellbeing. Decay can happen on the tops of teeth (coronal surfaces) or on the roots of teeth (root caries), which is more common in older adults.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride (SDF)?\nSilver diamine fluoride is a clear liquid that a dental professional paints onto teeth. It is designed to help prevent new decay and to stop existing decay from getting worse. A known effect is that treated decayed areas often turn dark or black. This color change shows where the decay has been stopped.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if SDF:\n- prevents new decay,\n- stops existing decay from getting worse,\n- avoids progression of early decay (secondary prevention),\n- causes unwanted effects, pain, or sensitivity,\n- affects appearance in ways people notice or dislike.\nWe also wanted to compare SDF with no treatment or placebo, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART; a way to remove decay with hand tools and fill the tooth with glass ionomer cement, a tooth-colored filling). We looked at whether different SDF strengths, application intervals, and treatment durations matter.\n\nHow is tooth decay treated?\nCommon options include:\n- fluoride varnish (a thin fluoride coating painted on teeth),\n- dental sealants (protective plastic coatings placed in deep grooves),\n- resin infiltration (a thin resin pushed into early decay to strengthen the enamel),\n- atraumatic restorative treatment (ART; removal of soft decay with hand tools and filling with glass ionomer cement),\n- silver diamine fluoride (SDF; a painted liquid that helps prevent and stop decay).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared SDF with other options or with placebo/no treatment. We summarized their results and judged how much confidence we can have in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 29 studies with 13,036 people: 12,020 children and 1,016 older adults. Studies compared SDF with placebo or no treatment, different ways of applying SDF, fluoride varnish, sealants or resin infiltration, and ART with glass ionomer. The abstract did not report where the studies took place, how long they lasted, or who funded them. Many studies had weaknesses in their methods, and some were small.\n\nMain results:\n- SDF versus placebo or no treatment: SDF probably reduces new decay on tooth roots. SDF may help stop decay from getting worse in children’s teeth. We do not know if SDF prevents new decay on the tops of adult teeth or stops decay there from getting worse. We also do not know about secondary prevention, unwanted effects, or changes in appearance because the evidence was unclear.\n- Different ways of using SDF (strength, how often, how long): We do not know which approach works best. The evidence was unclear.\n- SDF versus fluoride varnish: SDF may make little to no difference for preventing new decay in children’s teeth compared with fluoride varnish. For adult teeth and other outcomes (such as stopping decay from getting worse), the evidence was unclear.\n- SDF versus sealants or resin infiltration: We do not know which works better. The evidence was unclear.\n- SDF versus ART with glass ionomer cement: We do not know which works better for stopping decay in children’s teeth. The evidence was unclear. We also do not know about differences in unwanted effects, pain or sensitivity, or appearance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the results because study methods had problems. For example, people may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported the outcomes we needed. Several studies were small. The studies used different ways of applying SDF, which makes results hard to compare. Reporting of tooth staining and other unwanted effects was poor. Some studies did not take into account that several teeth in the same person can influence each other.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
