    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nAre video laryngoscopes (a laryngoscope with a tiny camera) better than standard laryngoscopes for placing breathing tubes in newborn babies?\n\nKey Messages\n- Videolaryngoscopy may help more newborn babies (neonates, aged 0 to 28 days) get the breathing tube in on the first try and may need slightly fewer tries overall. It may make little to no difference to the time it takes. It probably causes slightly fewer minor mouth, throat, or windpipe injuries (airway trauma). We do not know if it changes the chance of low oxygen (desaturation) or slow heart rate (bradycardia) during intubation, and other harms were not reported.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be sure about all benefits and risks. Results came from different hospitals and used different brands of video laryngoscopes, which can affect how well they work.\n- Future research should use stronger study methods, include more babies, compare specific devices, and report important harms and practical outcomes, such as time to place the tube.\n\nWhat is tracheal intubation in newborns, and why is it needed?\nSome newborn babies have breathing problems right after birth or when they are very sick. Doctors may need to place a breathing tube into the windpipe (tracheal intubation) to help them breathe and to give oxygen. This happens in the delivery room or the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nWhat are direct laryngoscopes and video laryngoscopes?\nA laryngoscope is a tool doctors use to see the voice box and guide the breathing tube into the windpipe. With direct laryngoscopy, the doctor looks directly into the babyâ€™s mouth. With videolaryngoscopy, the laryngoscope has a tiny camera and a screen. This can give a clearer view of the opening to the windpipe (the glottis), which may help place the tube.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether videolaryngoscopy works better and is safer than standard (direct) laryngoscopy for newborn babies. We looked at:\n- success on the first try\n- number of intubation attempts\n- time needed to place the tube\n- unwanted effects, such as low oxygen, slow heart rate, and injury to the mouth, throat, or windpipe\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared video laryngoscopes with standard laryngoscopes in newborn babies who needed a breathing tube. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we can have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies, with a total of 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies in hospitals around the world. Babies of both sexes were included. Different video laryngoscope brands were used, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope. We also found 7 ongoing studies and 5 studies not yet fully assessed. The studies mainly looked at results during the intubation itself.\n\nMain results:\n- Success on first try: Videolaryngoscopy may increase the chance of placing the tube on the first attempt.\n- Number of attempts: Videolaryngoscopy may reduce the number of attempts slightly.\n- Time to place the tube: Videolaryngoscopy may make little to no difference to how long intubation takes.\n- Oxygen levels and heart rate during intubation: We do not know if videolaryngoscopy changes the chance of low oxygen (desaturation) or slow heart rate (bradycardia) during intubation. The evidence for this is very uncertain.\n- Lowest oxygen level during intubation: Videolaryngoscopy may make little to no difference to the lowest oxygen level reached.\n- Injury to the mouth, throat, or windpipe (airway trauma): Videolaryngoscopy probably reduces this slightly compared with direct laryngoscopy.\n- Other harms: The studies did not report other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the results because it is hard to hide which device is being used during intubation, and staff likely knew the device. Many studies were small. The studies used different video laryngoscope brands and took place in different hospitals, which can affect results. Not all studies reported all the harms we care about, such as serious complications.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022."
