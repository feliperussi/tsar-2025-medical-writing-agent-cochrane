    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes closing the gaps (mesenteric defects) during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass help prevent internal hernias?\n\nKey messages\n- Closing the gaps in the tissue that holds the intestines (mesentery) during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may lower the chance of an internal hernia that causes a bowel blockage in the years after surgery. It may make little to no difference to short-term problems within 30 days. It is unclear whether it changes the risk of death within 30 days. Some evidence suggests the hospital stay may be a little longer, but we are not sure. The studies did not provide usable information about long-term pain.\n- These findings apply to people with obesity having keyhole (laparoscopic) or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The way surgeons closed the gaps differed between studies (different types of stitches), which may affect how well it works.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be confident about all results. More large, well-designed studies should track people for longer, report outcomes that matter to patients (such as pain, quality of life, repeat surgery, emergency care), and compare different ways of closing the gaps.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a type of weight-loss surgery. The surgeon makes the stomach smaller and connects part of the small intestine to this small stomach pouch. This helps people eat less and absorb fewer calories.\n\nWhat are mesenteric defects and internal hernias?\nThe mesentery is a thin sheet of tissue that holds the intestines in place. During surgery, small gaps (called mesenteric defects) can be left in this tissue. Later on, a loop of intestine can slip through a gap and get trapped. This is called an internal hernia. It can block the bowel and cut off blood supply. This can cause severe belly pain and may need urgent surgery.\n\nWhy might closing these gaps help or harm?\nSurgeons can stitch the gaps closed to try to prevent an internal hernia. But closing the gaps might pull on the join between two parts of the intestine (the join is called an anastomosis). This could kink the bowel and cause a blockage. We wanted to understand both the possible benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if stitching the gaps closed during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass:\n- reduces internal hernias that cause bowel blockage over the next years (up to 10 years),\n- changes short-term problems within 30 days,\n- affects deaths within 30 days,\n- affects problems during the operation,\n- changes length of hospital stay,\n- or changes long-term pain.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared closing the gaps with leaving them open during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 3 studies with 3010 people with obesity (body-mass index 35 or higher) who had laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In these studies, surgeons either closed the mesenteric gaps with stitches that do not dissolve or left them open. Two studies used continuous stitches and one used separate stitches. The studies followed people for months to years, and they assessed internal hernia with bowel blockage within 10 years. The abstract did not say where the studies took place or how they were funded. This Cochrane review itself had no dedicated funding.\n\nMain results\n- Internal hernia with bowel blockage (within 10 years): Closing the gaps may reduce this risk compared with leaving them open.\n- Problems within 30 days after surgery (overall): Closing the gaps may make little to no difference.\n- Death within 30 days: It is unclear if closing the gaps changes the risk of death. There were few events, so we cannot be sure.\n- Problems during the operation (overall): It is unclear if closing the gaps changes the chance of problems during surgery.\n- Length of hospital stay: It is unclear if closing the gaps changes how long people stay in hospital. Some results suggest the stay might be slightly longer when surgeons close the gaps, but we are not sure.\n- Long-term pain: The studies did not provide enough information to assess pain 2 years after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some results because there were only 3 studies, and some outcomes came from just 1 or 2 studies. Some studies were small and had few events, which makes the results uncertain. The way surgeons closed the gaps was not the same across studies, which could affect outcomes. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they received. The studies did not report some outcomes that matter to patients, such as long-term pain and quality of life.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024."
