    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (structured exercise and support for heart problems) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey Messages\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably helps adults with heart failure avoid hospital admissions and feel better in daily life in the short term. It may make little to no difference to deaths in the short term. The studies did not clearly report unwanted effects (harms), so we cannot comment on them.\n- Different ways of delivering these exercise programs seem to work similarly. This includes center-based, home-based, and digitally supported programs.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence for some groups, such as older adults, women, and people with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; the heart pumps out a normal percentage of blood but is stiff). Future studies should include these groups, track harms, and look at longer-term results and costs.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why does it matter?\nHeart failure means the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. People with heart failure often feel tired, breathless, and find it hard to be active. Many have a lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which means daily life feels harder and less enjoyable. Heart failure can lead to hospital stays and can shorten life.\n\nWhat is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation?\nExercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a structured program that helps people move safely and regularly. It may also include support such as education and counseling. Programs can be done in a hospital or center, at home, or with digital tools (for example, phone or video support).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps adults with heart failure:\n- live longer,\n- spend less time in hospital,\n- and feel better in daily life (HRQoL).\nWe also looked for information on costs and value for money.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation with no exercise (usual medical care). We summarized the results across studies and rated how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. Most studies lasted about 6 months. Many studies included people whose hearts pump less strongly (reduced ejection fraction). Fewer studies included people with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Many programs were center-based, but newer studies also tested home-based and digital support programs. People in the comparison groups received usual medical care without a structured exercise program. The abstract did not clearly report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Deaths (short term, up to 12 months): Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may make little to no difference to deaths in the short term. We have little confidence in this result because studies were small and not all reported detailed causes of death.\n- All-cause hospital admissions (short term): Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces hospital admissions. To make this easier to picture: for every 100 people receiving usual care, about 24 might go to hospital in the short term. With exercise-based rehabilitation, this might be closer to about 16 of 100.\n- Heart failure-related hospital admissions (short term): Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces heart failure-related hospital admissions slightly.\n- Health-related quality of life (short term): Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably improves how people feel and function in daily life. The improvement is big enough for many people to notice.\n- Overall, effects looked similar across different types of programs (center-based versus home-based), different exercise “doses,” and whether programs included only exercise or a more comprehensive package (exercise plus education or counseling).\n\nWe did not find clear information on unwanted effects (harms), such as injuries or worsening symptoms, in the abstract. Costs and value for money were listed as outcomes, but we could not summarize them here.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can reduce hospital use and improve daily life in the short term. However, we have less confidence in the results for deaths. Our confidence is limited because:\n- Many studies were short and small, and not all reported everything we wanted to know (for example, causes of death and harms).\n- Most studies included people with reduced ejection fraction, while older adults, women, and people with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were under-represented. This means the results may not apply equally to everyone with heart failure.\n- Programs varied in how they were delivered, which can make it harder to compare results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021."
