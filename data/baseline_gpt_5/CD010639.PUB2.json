    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo changes to shift schedules improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for people who work shifts?\n\nKey Messages\n- Limiting each shift to no more than 16 hours may increase sleep time off‑shift and probably reduces sleepiness during shifts slightly. For other schedule changes, it is unclear whether they improve sleep or alertness. The studies did not report unwanted effects from the schedule changes.\n- Studies tested several schedule changes, such as how shifts rotate (forward versus backward), how fast they rotate, how long shifts last, and whether weeks are compressed (the same hours packed into fewer days). We did not find evidence for many other possible changes, such as protected sleep time, split shifts, or schedules chosen by workers.\n- Future research should use better methods, measure sleep in similar ways, and report possible unwanted effects and costs. We need more good‑quality studies before drawing firm conclusions.\n\nWhat is shift work and why does it matter?\nShift work means working at different times of day or night, including evenings and nights. This can disturb the body’s sleep‑wake rhythm. People who work shifts often get too little sleep. This can make them sleepy at work and less alert. Sleep loss can affect health, safety, and work performance.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if changing the way shifts are scheduled can help people who work shifts:\n- sleep better off‑shift (when they are not working)\n- sleep longer off‑shift\n- feel less sleepy while working\n\nWhat kinds of schedule changes did the studies look at?\nThe studies looked at different ways to plan shifts, including:\n- Forward rotation versus backward rotation. Forward rotation means shifts move from morning to evening to night. Backward rotation moves from night to evening to morning.\n- Faster versus slower rotation. Faster rotation changes shift types more often.\n- Limiting maximum shift length (for example, 16 hours) versus no limit.\n- Shorter shifts (8 to 10 hours) versus longer shifts.\n- Compressed weeks (same total hours in fewer days) versus more spread out weeks.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested changes to shift schedules and measured sleep or sleepiness. We combined the results and judged how confident we are in the findings, based on study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 11 studies with 2125 people who work shifts. One study was done in a sleep laboratory and we did not use it to judge real‑world effects. Most studies took place in real workplaces and measured sleep off‑shift and sleepiness during shifts in different ways. The abstract did not say who funded the studies or how long they lasted.\n\nMain results\n- Forward versus backward rotation:\nIt is unclear if forward rotation makes a difference to sleep quality or sleep time off‑shift. It is also unclear if forward rotation reduces sleepiness during shifts.\n\n- Faster versus slower rotation:\nFaster rotation may make little to no difference to sleep quality off‑shift. We are very uncertain whether faster rotation reduces sleep time off‑shift. We are also very uncertain whether faster rotation reduces sleepiness during shifts.\n\n- Limiting each shift to a maximum of 16 hours versus no limit:\nLimiting shifts to 16 hours may increase sleep time off‑shift. On average, people may get about three‑quarters of an hour more sleep per day. This change probably reduces sleepiness during shifts slightly.\n\n- Shorter (8 to 10 hours) versus longer shifts:\nIt is unclear if shorter shifts make a difference to sleep quality or sleep time off‑shift. The effect on sleepiness during shifts is uncertain, with mixed findings across studies.\n\n- Compressed weeks versus more spread out weeks:\nIt is unclear if compressing the workweek makes a difference to sleep quality or sleep time off‑shift.\n\nOther schedule changes (such as protected sleep time, split shifts, or workers helping to design schedules) were not covered by the studies we found, so we cannot say how well those options work.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the findings. In many studies, people were not randomly placed into different schedules. This means differences between groups could be due to the people, not the schedules. People also knew which schedule they were on, which could affect how they reported sleep and sleepiness. The studies were small and used different ways to measure sleep and sleepiness, which makes results harder to compare. Not all outcomes we cared about were reported, and the studies did not report unwanted effects.\n\nHow can these findings help you?\nThese findings suggest that capping maximum shift length at 16 hours may help people sleep a bit longer and feel slightly less sleepy at work. For other schedule changes, we do not know if they help or not. Because the evidence is uncertain, results may differ between jobs, workplaces, and people.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022."
