    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo surgical sealants help stop bleeding at blood vessel joins (anastomoses) during vascular surgery?\n\nKey Messages\n- Sealants are glues or gels applied by the surgeon to help stop bleeding. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding at the join of blood vessels (anastomosis). We do not know if sealants reduce the chance that the bleeding-control method fails. The studies did not report deaths from bleeding or quality of life, and information about unwanted effects was limited.\n- Sealants may make little to no difference to blood loss during the operation, the total time in the operating room, bleeding after surgery, or needing to go back to the operating room to treat bleeding.\n- We have little confidence in these findings because the studies had important problems. Future research should use better methods, include more people, and report unwanted effects, costs, and outcomes that matter to patients.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is vascular surgery and what are anastomoses?\nVascular surgery is surgery on blood vessels, such as arteries and veins. During these operations, surgeons often create a join between two blood vessels or between a blood vessel and a synthetic tube called a graft. This surgical join is called an anastomosis (a carefully sewn connection). Bleeding can happen at these joins, especially from small needle holes made during stitching.\n\nWhat are surgical sealants?\nSealants are materials applied directly to tissues to help stop bleeding by sealing the surface. Some sealants contain fibrin (a natural protein that helps blood clot). Others are synthetic (made in a lab). Surgeons use sealants as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop bleeding well.\n\nWhy is stopping bleeding at the join important?\nBleeding can make the operation take longer, increase the need for blood transfusions, and raise the risk of problems after surgery. Good bleeding control helps the surgeon finish the operation safely.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether surgical sealants help stop bleeding at the anastomosis and whether they cause any unwanted effects. We looked at how fast bleeding stopped, whether bleeding control failed, blood loss during the operation, time in the operating room, bleeding after surgery, needing an unplanned return to the operating room, death from bleeding, quality of life, and other adverse events (unwanted effects).\n\nHow is bleeding controlled during vascular surgery?\nSurgeons use several methods:\n– manual compression (pressing on the area)\n– pads or sponges that help clotting, such as oxidized cellulose or gelatin sponges\n– reversing blood thinners (anticoagulants) when safe\n– surgical sealants (glues or gels applied to the tissue)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where people having vascular surgery received sealants or usual care methods to stop bleeding at the anastomosis. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies involving 2376 people having vascular surgery with an anastomosis. These studies compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with usual care methods such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponges, or manual compression. Most outcomes were measured during surgery and up to 30 days after surgery. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Time to stop bleeding: Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding at the anastomosis.\n- Failure of bleeding control: We do not know if sealants reduce the chance that bleeding control fails. The results were very uncertain.\n- Blood loss during the operation: Sealants may make little to no difference to blood loss.\n- Time in the operating room: Sealants may make little to no difference to total operating time.\n- Bleeding after surgery (up to 30 days): Sealants may make little to no difference to bleeding after surgery.\n- Unplanned return to the operating room (for bleeding, up to 30 days): Sealants may make little to no difference to needing to go back to the operating room.\n- Death from bleeding and quality of life: The studies did not report these outcomes.\n- Unwanted effects (adverse events): Information was limited, so we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because of several issues. People in the studies, and often the surgeons and staff, may have known which treatment they were receiving. This can affect how outcomes are measured and reported. The studies were small, and there were not enough studies for some outcomes to be certain about the results. The studies used different methods and sometimes gave different results. We also worry that studies showing benefits might be more likely to be published than studies showing no benefit.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
