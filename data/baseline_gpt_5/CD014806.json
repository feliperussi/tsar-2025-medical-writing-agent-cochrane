    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs giving a small amount of table sugar (sucrose) before a heel prick (heel lance) helpful for newborn babies?\n\nKey Messages\n- Giving a small amount of sucrose before a single heel prick probably reduces signs of pain in the first minute compared with water, placebo, or no treatment. We do not know if sucrose is better or worse than breastfeeding, pacifier sucking (non‑nutritive sucking), laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking. Sucrose may make little to no difference compared with glucose, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care. Minor unwanted effects were reported, but none needed treatment.\n- We do not know if adding sucrose to pacifier sucking helps more than pacifier sucking alone. The evidence for this combination is very uncertain.\n- We need more good‑quality studies that use the same pain measures, look at longer‑term effects and safety, and compare sucrose with common comfort methods that parents and staff already use.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is a heel prick and why can it hurt newborn babies?\nA heel prick (also called heel lance) is a quick cut or puncture on a baby’s heel to collect a few drops of blood. Newborn babies, both full‑term and preterm (born early), often have heel pricks for routine tests. Even small procedures can cause pain and stress. Reducing pain matters because calm babies breathe and feed better, and parents feel more at ease.\n\nWhat is sucrose and why might it help?\nSucrose is table sugar. In hospital, staff may give a few drops of sucrose solution on a baby’s tongue just before a procedure. The sweet taste can have a calming and pain‑relieving effect. Pain is often measured using tools like PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) and NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale), which rate signs such as facial expression, crying, and heart rate to give a pain score.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sucrose reduces pain during and shortly after heel pricks in newborn babies, and whether there are any longer‑term effects. We also wanted to compare sucrose with other comfort methods, such as pacifier sucking, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, glucose, music, acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin‑to‑skin care, and to check for unwanted effects.\n\nHow is heel prick pain usually managed?\nCommon options include:\n– sucrose (drops of sugar solution on the tongue)\n– glucose (another simple sugar solution)\n– pacifier sucking (non‑nutritive sucking, NNS)\n– breastfeeding or expressed breast milk\n– skin‑to‑skin care (baby on a parent’s bare chest)\n– facilitated tucking (holding the baby in a curled, supported position)\n– music or acupuncture, including laser acupuncture (light used at acupuncture points)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to February 2022 that compared sucrose with other methods for newborns having heel pricks. We summarized the results and rated how much confidence we could place in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 55 studies with 6273 newborn babies. Some studies included full‑term babies, some included preterm babies, and a few included both. Most studies focused on heel pricks; some also looked at other small procedures. Studies compared sucrose with water, placebo, or no treatment, and with comfort methods like pacifier sucking, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, glucose, music, acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin‑to‑skin care.\n\nMain results:\n- Compared with water, placebo, or no treatment: Sucrose probably reduces pain scores in the first 30 to 60 seconds after a single heel prick.\n- For some pain tools (such as DAN), we do not know if sucrose changes pain scores at 30 seconds after lancing.\n- Compared with glucose: Sucrose may make little to no difference in pain scores at 30 and 60 seconds.\n- Compared with breastfeeding: We do not know if sucrose is better or worse for reducing pain after lancing.\n- Compared with expressed breast milk: Sucrose may make little to no difference during lancing and at 30 seconds, and may slightly increase pain scores at 60 seconds.\n- Compared with laser acupuncture: We do not know if sucrose reduces pain.\n- Compared with facilitated tucking: We do not know if sucrose reduces pain during or after the heel prick.\n- During repeated heel pricks, compared with skin‑to‑skin plus water: Sucrose may make little to no difference in pain scores at 30 and 60 seconds across the first three lances.\n- Adding sucrose to pacifier sucking, compared with pacifier sucking alone: We do not know if this combination reduces pain.\n\nUnwanted effects:\nMinor unwanted effects were reported, and none needed treatment. The studies did not report serious problems linked to sucrose.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for the comparison with water, placebo, or no treatment, because studies often measured pain only in the first minute after lancing. We have little or no confidence in many other comparisons because the studies were small, used different pain scoring tools and timings, and sometimes looked at only one or two very specific situations. Many studies focused on short‑term pain and did not report longer‑term effects or full safety information.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
