    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhich numbing nerve block (regional analgesia) works best for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that the main numbing nerve blocks used for breast cancer surgery—paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block—give similar pain relief overall. The pectoral nerve block may reduce pain slightly more than the paravertebral block soon after surgery and at 24 hours, but this difference is small and may not be noticeable. Only a few studies reported side effects, and they did not report serious complications, but the evidence about harms is limited.\n- During movement soon after surgery, the pectoral nerve block may reduce pain more than the paravertebral block, but we are not very sure. By 24 hours, the blocks seem to work about the same for pain during movement.\n- We did not find enough good-quality information about important outcomes like need for extra pain medicines, nausea and vomiting, or overall recovery. Future studies should be larger, follow people for longer, measure side effects carefully, and focus on outcomes that matter to people.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is regional analgesia and why does it matter after breast surgery?\nMany people have pain after breast cancer surgery. Good pain control can help you feel better, move sooner, and may reduce the need for strong pain medicines like opioids (morphine-like medicines). Regional analgesia means a numbing nerve block. A doctor injects numbing medicine near nerves to block pain from the chest and breast area. Common blocks include:\n- paravertebral block – numbing medicine near the nerves beside the spine\n- erector spinae plane block – numbing near the muscles along the spine\n- pectoral nerve block – numbing near the nerves in the chest muscles\n- serratus anterior plane block – numbing near the nerves at the side of the chest\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which of these blocks works best for pain after breast cancer surgery. We also looked for unwanted effects (harms), the need for extra pain medicines (like opioids or anti-inflammatory painkillers), nausea and vomiting, time to first pain medicine, and overall recovery.\n\n[Optional] How is pain usually treated after breast cancer surgery?\nPeople usually receive general anesthesia (medicines that make you sleep) during surgery. After surgery, doctors may use one of these nerve blocks plus pain medicines such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatory painkillers, and sometimes opioids.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that directly compared these nerve blocks in women having breast cancer surgery. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in the findings, based on study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 39 studies with 2348 women. The studies took place between 2013 and 2023 in Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. Most people had removal of the whole breast and nearby lymph nodes (modified radical mastectomy). All surgeries used general anesthesia in hospital. Most blocks were single injections of long-acting numbing medicines, guided by ultrasound. For our main pain analyses, we focused on studies we judged to use stronger methods.\n\nPain at rest soon after surgery (about 2 hours):\n- The pectoral nerve block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block. We are confident this difference is small and may not be noticeable to most people.\n- The erector spinae plane block makes little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block. We are confident about this.\n- The serratus anterior plane block probably makes little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block.\n\nPain during movement soon after surgery (about 2 hours):\n- The pectoral nerve block may reduce pain compared with the paravertebral block, but we are not very sure.\n- The erector spinae plane block may make little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block.\n\nPain at rest at 24 hours:\n- The pectoral nerve block reduces pain slightly compared with the paravertebral block. We are confident this difference is small and may not be noticeable.\n- The erector spinae plane block makes little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block. We are confident about this.\n- The serratus anterior plane block makes little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block. We are confident about this.\n\nPain during movement at 24 hours:\n- The erector spinae plane block probably makes little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block.\n- The pectoral nerve block may make little to no difference compared with the paravertebral block.\n- For the serratus anterior plane block, we do not know if there is a difference because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nPain at 48 hours:\n- We do not know whether the paravertebral block and erector spinae plane block differ for pain at rest or during movement at 48 hours. The evidence is very uncertain because only very small studies reported this.\n\nUnwanted effects (harms):\nOnly a few studies reported side effects, and they did not report serious problems such as collapsed lung, nerve damage, or blood vessel injury. Because few people were studied for harms, we cannot be sure about the true risk of rare problems.\n\nOther outcomes:\nInformation on extra pain medicine use, time to first pain medicine, nausea and vomiting, and overall recovery was limited or came from very small studies. We cannot draw firm conclusions about these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately to not very confident in many findings because many studies were small, and there were not enough studies for several outcomes. Some results varied between studies, and some outcomes were reported by only one or two small studies. Few studies measured side effects carefully, so rare harms could have been missed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
