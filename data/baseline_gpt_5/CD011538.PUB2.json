    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo education support services help children and adolescents with a chronic health condition (a condition that lasts for a long time) stay engaged in school and do better academically?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if education support services help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions stay engaged in school or improve grades. Some support may slightly improve mental health (self-esteem, meaning how you feel about yourself). No harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The evidence comes from only a few small studies, mostly in children with cancer and children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The studies did not report on quality of life or unwanted effects, and some did not fully describe what support was given.\n- Future research should include more children with different long-term conditions, use clear and consistent measures of school engagement and grades, report quality of life and unwanted effects, and follow children for longer.\n\nWhat is a chronic health condition in children and adolescents?\nA chronic health condition is an illness that lasts for a long time and does not go away on its own. Examples include cancer, asthma, diabetes, and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). These conditions can make it hard for children and adolescents to attend school regularly and take part in learning and social activities.\n\nWhy can long-term illness affect school engagement and learning?\nSchool attendance and taking part in class help children build knowledge, social skills, and confidence. When illness causes them to miss school, they may feel less connected to learning and friends. This can lead to lower grades and challenges with mood, confidence, and future choices.\n\nWhat are education support services?\nEducation support services aim to keep children learning when illness keeps them away from school. These services can help with keeping up with classwork, staying connected with teachers and classmates, and returning to school after treatment or a flare-up of symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out:\n- if education support services help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions stay engaged in school (for example, attending classes, doing homework, and feeling connected);\n- if these services improve academic achievement (for example, grades and test scores);\n- if they affect mental health (including self-esteem), quality of life, and the process of returning to school.\n\nWhat kinds of education support services are used?\nEducation support can include:\n- hospital teachers or home tutoring\n- online lessons and virtual classrooms\n- tailored learning plans and extra time for assignments\n- school liaison to coordinate between hospital, family, and school\n- peer support or mentoring to stay socially connected\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested education support services for children and adolescents with long-term health conditions, compared with usual school arrangements or no special support. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we could have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included 359 children and adolescents. Three studies focused on children with cancer, and 1 study focused on children with ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). The studies measured different things, including school engagement, academic achievement, return to school, and self-esteem. None of the studies reported quality of life or unwanted effects.\n\nFor school engagement, most studies suggested a benefit, but overall we are not sure if education support services have an effect. The studies were small and used different ways to measure engagement.\n\nFor academic achievement, results were mixed. Based on the available studies, it is unclear if education support services make a difference to grades or test scores.\n\nFor returning to school after illness, one small study suggested a possible benefit, but we are uncertain about this because it was only one study.\n\nFor mental health, education support services may slightly improve self-esteem. This means some children may feel a bit better about themselves when they receive support.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because:\n- the studies were small and there were only a few of them;\n- the studies were focused on specific conditions (mostly cancer and ADHD), so we cannot tell if the findings apply to other long-term conditions;\n- the way school engagement and grades were measured differed between studies;\n- some studies did not provide full information on all outcomes or on how the support was delivered;\n- no study reported quality of life or unwanted effects, so we do not know about potential harms or extra burdens.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021."
