    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes bronchoscopy-guided antibiotics (using bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL) help treat lung infection in children with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey Messages\n- In children with cystic fibrosis, choosing antibiotics based on bronchoscopy with BAL may make little to no difference to lung function and probably makes little to no difference to chest scan changes, compared with standard care that uses throat or cough swabs and symptoms. Mild unwanted effects after BAL were common (for example, a temporary worsening of cough), and serious problems were uncommon. Hospital stays may be higher with BAL-guided care. Harms were not reported for adults because no adult studies were found.\n- We found 2 studies in children. Costs of care over 5 years were probably similar for BAL-guided care and standard care. Quality of life, nutrition, and detection of Pseudomonas (a harmful bacteria) may also be similar.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the benefits or harms. Future research should include adults, use clear rules for when to do BAL, and report important outcomes such as lung health, hospital stays, quality of life, and costs.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why do lung infections matter?\nCystic fibrosis is a long-term condition that affects the lungs and other organs. Thick, sticky mucus can build up in the airways and make infections more likely. Treating infections early is key to protecting lung health.\n\nHow are lung infections usually checked in cystic fibrosis?\nWhen people cannot produce sputum (phlegm), doctors often use throat or cough swabs to look for germs. These samples are easy to take, but they may not always show what is happening deeper in the lungs.\n\nWhat are bronchoscopy and BAL?\nBronchoscopy is a procedure where a doctor passes a thin, flexible tube with a camera into the airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is when the doctor puts a small amount of fluid into the lungs and then collects it to test for germs. These tests can directly sample the lower airways, but they are invasive and can cause side effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using bronchoscopy with BAL to choose antibiotics works better than standard care based on throat or cough swabs and symptoms. We looked at lung health, hospital stays, quality of life, costs, and unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared bronchoscopy-guided antibiotics with standard care in people with cystic fibrosis. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies, both in children. One study followed 170 infants diagnosed by newborn screening until age 5 and reported results for 157 children. It compared antibiotics chosen by BAL with standard care based on symptoms and throat swabs. The other study enrolled 30 children aged 5 to 18 years and compared antibiotics chosen after BAL triggered by a change in a lung test called lung clearance index (LCI) with standard care based on throat swabs taken when children were unwell. We did not find any studies in adults.\n\nAcross these studies, using BAL to guide antibiotics may make little to no difference to lung function over 2 to 5 years. This included measures such as LCI and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), which are common lung tests. BAL-guided care probably makes little to no difference to chest changes seen on computed tomography (CT) scans. It may make little to no difference to nutrition, quality of life, the number of times Pseudomonas is found, or the success of treatment to clear Pseudomonas. The number of lung flare-ups (pulmonary exacerbations) may be similar between the two approaches.\n\nHospital stays may be higher with BAL-guided care. Average costs of care over 5 years were probably similar for both approaches.\n\nUnwanted effects of BAL were reported in children. For every 100 procedures, about 30 led to a temporary worsening of cough. Serious problems were uncommon. For every 100 procedures, about 5 led to a clear worsening in health during or soon after BAL.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in some findings, but overall we have limited confidence. There were only 2 studies, one of which was small. The studies used different rules for when to do BAL and measured outcomes in different ways, which made it hard to combine results. Some study details were unclear. Importantly, we found no studies in adults. Because of these limits, we cannot be certain about the long-term benefits or harms of BAL-guided care.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023."
