    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes briefly stopping blood flow to a limb (remote ischaemic preconditioning) help people having vascular or endovascular surgery?\n\nKey Messages\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) means using a cuff, like a blood pressure cuff, to briefly stop and restart blood flow in an arm or leg before or during surgery. Based on the studies we found, RIPC probably makes little to no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, having a heart attack, kidney problems, or a stroke. It also probably makes little to no difference to time in hospital or how long the operation or anesthesia lasts. It may make little to no difference to limb loss. The studies did not clearly report unwanted effects from using the cuff (such as pain or skin problems).\n- The people in the studies were mostly older men having planned major blood vessel surgery, either open surgery or less invasive surgery done inside the blood vessels (endovascular surgery). This is the group the findings apply to.\n- Future research should include larger, well-designed studies that report patient-important outcomes and any unwanted effects. We also need studies that include more women and different age groups.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are vascular and endovascular surgeries, and why do they matter?\nVascular surgery treats problems with blood vessels, such as blocked arteries or weak artery walls (aneurysms). Endovascular surgery is a less invasive type done inside the blood vessels using thin tubes. These major surgeries are often planned in advance. They can still carry risks, such as death, heart attack, kidney injury, stroke, losing a limb, and long stays in hospital.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC)?\nRIPC is a simple method that aims to protect the body during surgery. A healthcare worker inflates a cuff on your arm or leg to briefly stop blood flow, then lets it flow again. Doing this in short cycles, before or during surgery, may “train” the body to handle short periods of low blood flow during the operation. The hope is that this reduces harm to the heart, kidneys, brain, and other organs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if RIPC, compared with no RIPC, helps people having planned major vascular or endovascular surgery. We looked for effects on death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, losing a limb, time in hospital, and the length of the operation or anesthesia. We also looked for any unwanted effects from RIPC.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where people were randomly put into 2 groups: one group had RIPC and the other did not. We combined the results and judged how confident we are in the findings, based on the size and methods of the studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 14 studies that included 1295 people. Most people were older adults (average ages ranged from about 64 to 76 years), and 84% were men. The studies took place between 2003 and 2019 in people having planned major vascular or endovascular surgery. The RIPC method used a cuff on an arm or leg to briefly stop and restart blood flow in cycles, usually before surgery started. The studies measured outcomes around the time of surgery and during the hospital stay. The abstract did not report which countries the studies took place in, who funded them, or how long people were followed after leaving the hospital.\n\nMain results\n- Death around the time of surgery: RIPC probably makes little to no difference.\n- Heart attack after surgery: RIPC probably makes little to no difference.\n- Kidney problems after surgery: RIPC probably makes little to no difference.\n- Stroke after surgery: RIPC probably makes little to no difference.\n- Losing a limb: RIPC may make little to no difference, but we are not very sure about this result.\n- Time in hospital: RIPC probably makes little to no difference.\n- Length of the operation or anesthesia: RIPC probably makes little to no difference.\n\nWhat does this mean for people having surgery?\nFor people having planned major blood vessel surgery, using a cuff to briefly stop and restart blood flow in a limb before or during surgery is unlikely to change the chances of the main problems that worry people and doctors, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, stroke, or losing a limb. It is also unlikely to change how long the surgery or hospital stay is. The studies did not clearly report unwanted effects from the cuff, so we do not know much about discomfort or other minor harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were small and the results were not very precise. The results also differed somewhat between studies, and some studies with different results may be missing from the published record. Most people in the studies were older men, so the results may not fully reflect what happens in women or younger people.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022."
