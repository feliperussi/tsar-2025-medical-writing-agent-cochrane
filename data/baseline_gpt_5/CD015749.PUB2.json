    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of combined treatments (multimodal interventions) for cachexia (disease-related wasting) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nKey Messages\n– We did not find enough good-quality evidence to show whether combined treatments (for example, medicines plus nutrition support and/or exercise) help people with cachexia. It is unclear if they improve physical function, strength, weight, appetite, fatigue, blood test markers, or quality of life. It is also unclear if they change the chance of unwanted effects (harms).\n– The studies were small and short, used different mixes of treatments, and included people with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. Some important results were not reported, and some study data could not be used.\n– Future research should include larger, longer, well-designed studies that fairly compare treatments by randomly assigning people to different groups (so the groups are similar). Researchers should clearly describe the treatment mix, measure outcomes that matter to people, and report unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is cachexia?\nCachexia means disease-related wasting. It is a complex problem that can happen in long-lasting (chronic) illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and COPD (a long-term lung disease that makes it hard to breathe). People with cachexia often lose weight and muscle without trying, feel very tired, have a poor appetite, and find daily life harder.\n\nWhat are combined treatments (multimodal interventions)?\nCombined treatments use more than one approach at the same time. For cachexia, this may include:\n– medicines (for example, to reduce inflammation or improve appetite)\n– nutrition support (for example, high-calorie, high-protein food or supplements)\n– exercise (for example, strength or endurance training)\nThe idea is that these approaches may work better together than alone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combined treatments help to ease or stabilize cachexia. We looked at benefits (such as better physical function, strength, weight, and quality of life) and unwanted effects (harms).\n\nOptional: How is cachexia treated?\nCachexia care can include:\n– nutrition support (high-energy, high-protein food, supplements, or feeding support)\n– exercise (gentle strength and activity plans)\n– medicines (for appetite, inflammation, or other symptoms)\nCare is often tailored to the person and their illness.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies in adults with cachexia or at risk of it that tested combined treatments and compared them with usual care, a different mix of the same treatments, or a single treatment. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies with 926 adults. The average age was 63 years. Six studies were done in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. Six studies involved people with cancer, and one each involved people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. Most studies measured outcomes right after treatment. Treatment periods ranged from about 6 weeks to 3 to 7 months. Funding sources were not clear from the information we had.\n\nThe combined treatments included different mixes of medicines, nutrition support, and exercise. The studies compared these combined treatments with:\n– usual care (the care people would normally receive)\n– a different mix or dose of the same treatments\n– a single type of treatment (for example, nutrition support alone)\n\nOverall, the results were unclear. Across the different comparisons, it is unclear if combined treatments have an effect on physical function, strength, body weight, body composition (fat and muscle), appetite, fatigue, blood test markers (biochemical markers), or quality of life (how people feel and function in daily life). In one study that compared combined treatment with usual care, quality of life was not reported. Some studies measured unwanted effects (also called adverse events), but it is unclear if combined treatments change the chance of these harms. In a few studies, we could not use the available data, and not all studies reported all outcomes we were interested in.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were small and short, and there were not enough studies to be sure about the results. People in the studies received different mixes of treatments, and the studies included different types of chronic illness. This makes it hard to compare results. Some studies did not report all the outcomes we needed, and some data were not usable. In some studies, it is possible that people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
