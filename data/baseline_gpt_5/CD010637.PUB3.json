    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of physical exercise for people with chronic venous insufficiency (weak leg veins) who do not have ulcers?\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know if structured physical exercise helps people with chronic venous insufficiency (a long-lasting problem where leg veins do not move blood back to the heart well) who do not have open leg ulcers. It is unclear if exercise improves symptoms, vein function, walking ability, muscle strength, ankle movement, or quality of life. The studies did not report harmful effects or whether people later developed leg ulcers.\n- The studies were small, short, and used different exercise plans and different ways to measure results. Because of this, we are uncertain about any benefits or harms.\n- Future research should test clear exercise plans (type, intensity, how often, and how long), include more people, follow them for longer, and report unwanted effects and whether ulcers develop.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long-lasting condition where the valves in the leg veins do not work well. Blood collects in the lower legs instead of moving back up to the heart. This can cause swelling, pain, heavy or tired legs, cramps, and skin changes. Over time, some people can get open sores on the legs called venous leg ulcers.\n\nWhy might exercise help?\nThe calf muscles in your lower legs work like a pump. When they contract, they push blood up the veins toward the heart. Structured physical exercise may strengthen these muscles and help blood flow. This might reduce symptoms and improve daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if structured physical exercise, compared with no structured exercise, helps people with chronic venous insufficiency who do not have open leg ulcers. We looked for effects on:\n- symptoms and daily life\n- tests of how well blood moves in the leg veins\n- walking ability and leg muscle strength\n- ankle movement\n- whether ulcers later develop\n- unwanted effects (harms)\n\n[Optional] How is chronic venous insufficiency treated?\nCommon options include:\n- compression stockings (tight socks that help push blood up the legs)\n- leg elevation and staying active\n- structured physical exercise\n- weight management\n- vein procedures, such as closing problem veins with heat or chemicals, or surgery\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to March 2022 that compared a structured exercise plan with no structured exercise in people with chronic venous insufficiency without ulcers. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 small studies with 146 people. All compared a structured exercise plan with no structured exercise. The exercise plans were different across studies. They varied in the type of exercise, how hard it was, how often people did it, and how long it lasted. Study length ranged from about 8 weeks to 6 months. The studies measured results in different ways, so we could not combine their data. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Symptoms and signs: It is unclear if exercise changes leg symptoms or signs after several weeks or months.\n- Vein function tests: It is unclear if exercise changes how well the leg veins empty and refill (for example, how strongly the calf muscles push blood up the leg, or how quickly veins fill again when you stand).\n- Venous leg ulcers: No study reported whether people later developed open leg ulcers.\n- Quality of life: It is unclear if exercise changes quality of life.\n- Walking ability and exercise capacity: It is unclear if exercise improves how far or how long people can walk.\n- Muscle strength: It is unclear if exercise improves leg muscle strength.\n- Ankle movement: It is unclear if exercise improves ankle movement.\n- Unwanted effects (harms): The studies did not report harmful effects.\n- Surgical treatment: We did not find information on whether people later needed vein procedures or surgery.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for you?\nBased on the current evidence, we cannot say if adding a structured exercise plan helps or harms people with chronic venous insufficiency who do not have ulcers. Some studies hinted at improvements in certain tests, but the studies were too small and different from each other for us to be sure. If you are thinking about exercise, you might still choose to be active for general health, but we cannot tell from these studies how much it helps this specific condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and often short. People likely knew which group they were in, which can affect results. The exercise plans and the ways outcomes were measured were different across studies. Not all important outcomes were reported, including harmful effects and whether ulcers developed. Because of all this, we cannot be sure about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
