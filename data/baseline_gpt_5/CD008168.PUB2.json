    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIntermittent or continuous phototherapy (light treatment): which works better for newborn jaundice (yellow skin from high bilirubin)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that intermittent phototherapy (light on and off in planned cycles) may make little to no difference to how fast bilirubin falls compared with continuous phototherapy (light on all the time). Deaths were rare and were similar between the two groups. Serious brain injury from very high bilirubin (also called kernicterus) was not well measured, so we do not know if one approach is safer than the other.\n- Intermittent phototherapy was linked to fewer total hours under the lights. This could help with feeding and bonding, but we do not know if it changes important health outcomes. In babies born early (preterm), continuous phototherapy may work better, but the evidence is limited.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to answer all safety questions. Larger, well-designed studies should measure brain injury, need for extra treatment when lights do not work, and longer-term outcomes in both term and preterm babies.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is newborn jaundice and why does it matter?\nMany newborns develop jaundice in the first days of life. Their skin and the whites of their eyes look yellow. This happens when a yellow substance called bilirubin builds up in the blood. Most jaundice is mild and goes away. Very high bilirubin can be dangerous and can harm the brain.\n\nWhat is phototherapy?\nPhototherapy is light treatment. Blue light shines on the baby’s skin and helps the body break down bilirubin so it can be removed. Doctors often use phototherapy first when bilirubin gets too high. Phototherapy can be given continuously (light stays on all the time) or intermittently (light is turned on and off in planned cycles). Intermittent phototherapy may allow more time for feeding, cuddling, and sleep.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if intermittent phototherapy works as well as continuous phototherapy to lower bilirubin in newborns. We also wanted to know about safety. This includes deaths, brain injury from very high bilirubin (kernicterus), and what happens when light treatment does not work and babies need extra treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to January 2022 that compared intermittent with continuous phototherapy in newborns. We combined the results and judged how confident we can be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 12 studies with 1600 newborns. The studies included both full-term babies and babies born early (preterm). Babies were up to 30 days old. The studies compared planned cycles of on–off light time with light that stayed on without breaks. One more study is still ongoing and four studies are awaiting assessment, so more results may be added in the future. The studies used different light schedules and doses. The reports did not clearly state who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- How fast bilirubin falls: Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to how fast bilirubin falls compared with continuous phototherapy. For most babies, both ways seemed to lower bilirubin at a similar speed.\n- Preterm babies: Continuous phototherapy may work better in babies born early. This means it may lower bilirubin faster in this group. However, the evidence is limited, so we are not sure.\n- Serious brain injury (kernicterus): It is unclear if intermittent or continuous phototherapy changes the risk of bilirubin-related brain injury. Very few babies had this problem in the studies, and it was not well measured.\n- Deaths: Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to deaths compared with continuous phototherapy.\n- When lights do not work (treatment failure): It is unclear if intermittent or continuous phototherapy changes the chance that babies need extra treatment because the lights did not work well enough.\n- Time under the lights: Intermittent phototherapy may reduce the total hours that babies spend under the lights. This could make feeding and bonding easier. We do not know if fewer hours under the lights affects important health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some results because many studies were small and measured different things in different ways. The light schedules varied across studies, which makes it hard to compare them. It is possible that families and hospital staff knew which treatment babies received. Important safety outcomes, like brain injury and what happens when lights do not work, were not well reported. There were not enough studies focused only on babies born early, even though they may be at higher risk.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022."
