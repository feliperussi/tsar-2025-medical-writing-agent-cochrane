    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat do healthcare workers think about bringing primary healthcare services together (integration)?\n\nKey Messages\n- This review mapped research on how healthcare workers view primary healthcare integration (bringing separate services together). The research was very mixed and did not give one clear picture. The studies did not report benefits or unwanted effects for patients or staff, so we cannot say whether integration helps or harms.\n- Researchers studied many countries and many service areas. They used different ways to integrate care, such as combining services in one place, adding new services to existing clinics, or linking services so people can move between them.\n- Future studies should use shared, clear definitions, include long‑term follow‑up, cover under‑represented regions, and report how integration affects care quality, workload, and any unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is primary healthcare and what does “integration” mean?\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) is the first level of care you get in the community. It includes services like vaccinations, care for long‑term conditions, family planning, and care for common illnesses.\n\nPHC integration means bringing services together that were once separate. For example, a clinic might offer HIV care, tuberculosis (TB) care, and family planning in the same visit. People hope integration will make care easier to access and more efficient, especially in places with fewer resources. Many countries see it as part of universal health coverage (making sure people get the care they need without financial hardship).\n\nWhy are healthcare workers’ views important?\nHealthcare workers shape how new ways of working are put into daily practice. Their views and experiences can help explain why integration works well in some places and not in others. Understanding their views can guide how to plan, deliver, and improve integrated services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find and describe studies that asked healthcare workers about PHC integration. We aimed to map:\n- where the studies took place and what kinds of services were brought together\n- who was involved (for example, nurses, doctors, community health workers, managers, policymakers)\n- how integration was done (for example, combining services, adding services, or linking services)\n- which groups of patients the services aimed to reach\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies from any country that used interviews, focus groups, or other methods to explore healthcare workers’ views and experiences of integrating primary care. We summarized what these studies looked at and where they took place, and we considered how the study methods might affect how much we can rely on the patterns we saw.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe included 184 studies (reported across 191 papers). Most were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp rise in the last 5 years. Most studies used interviews or group discussions at one point in time. Only a few followed workers over time or looked closely at daily work in real‑world settings. The studies took place in 37 countries, with a near‑even split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income countries. There were gaps in many regions. Some countries appeared more often than others, such as the USA, South Africa, and Uganda. Only a minority of studies used a guiding model to plan, deliver, and assess integration.\n\nResearchers studied six broad streams of services being brought together:\n- mental and behavioural health\n- HIV, TB, and sexual and reproductive health (for example, contraception and pregnancy care)\n- maternal, women’s, and child health\n- non‑communicable diseases (long‑lasting illnesses like diabetes and heart disease)\n- general PHC services\n- allied and specialised services (for example, rehabilitation or pharmacy)\n\nSome studies looked at full integration (services delivered together in one system). Others looked at partial integration (some parts delivered together). We saw three main strategies:\n- horizontal integration (combining similar services at the same level of care)\n- service expansion (adding new services to existing clinics)\n- service linkage (creating strong referral links between services)\n\nThe people involved in planning or delivering integration included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied health professionals, lay healthcare workers (community health workers and other trained staff without professional degrees), and support staff. The target patient groups varied widely.\n\nMain results\nThe main finding is diversity. The research covered many countries, services, strategies, and types of healthcare workers. Because the studies were so varied in topic and method, we could not combine their findings into one clear answer about how healthcare workers feel about integration.\n\nIt is unclear if integrating primary care services improves care quality or access, or if it affects healthcare workers’ workload and wellbeing. Most studies described how integration was set up and who was involved, rather than measuring benefits or unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident that this evidence gives a complete, consistent picture because:\n- Studies used many different methods and focused on different services and settings, so it is hard to compare them.\n- Most studies took a snapshot at one point in time. Few followed changes over time or looked deeply at everyday work.\n- Some regions were studied more than others, so the findings may not apply everywhere.\n- The review did not include grey literature (unpublished reports), and some non‑English studies could not be fully checked, so we may have missed relevant research.\n- Many studies did not use a clear, shared model to plan and assess integration, which makes results harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020."
