    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis (a long-lasting mouth condition that tightens the cheeks and limits how wide you can open)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Antioxidants (substances that protect cells, used as medicines or supplements) probably reduce burning mouth sensation and slightly improve mouth opening after 3 to 6 months. These changes in mouth opening are small and may not be noticeable to many people. We do not have enough information to judge harms across treatments. Some studies reported mild stomach problems, and one surgery (abdominal fat graft) caused serious problems for a few people.\n- For other treatments such as steroid injections into the mouth tissue, physiotherapy exercises, vasodilators (medicines that help blood flow), or pentoxifylline (a vasodilator), benefits are unclear. No study measured whether people returned to normal eating, chewing, or speech.\n- Future research needs larger, well-designed studies that measure results important to daily life, like eating, speaking, pain, and mouth opening, and that carefully track unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting mouth condition. It causes tight bands of tissue in the cheeks and mouth, severe burning or pain, and reduced mouth opening. OSF can make chewing, swallowing, and speaking difficult and can lower quality of life. People with OSF have a higher risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is areca nut chewing (often called betel nut).\n\nWhy does treatment matter?\nWhen OSF tightens the mouth and burns or hurts, daily activities like eating and speaking become hard. Many people try to stop areca nut chewing, often with support. Some also use medicines, injections, exercises, or surgery to relieve symptoms and improve mouth opening.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which treatments help people with OSF most. We looked for benefits such as better mouth opening, less burning or pain, and improved jaw movement. We also wanted to know about harms, including unwanted effects, hospital stays, and discomfort after treatment.\n\nHow is OSF treated?\n– Behavioural support to stop areca nut chewing\n– Antioxidants (substances that protect cells)\n– Vasodilators (medicines that help blood flow), such as pentoxifylline\n– Steroid injections into the mouth tissue (for example, dexamethasone), sometimes with an enzyme called hyaluronidase (breaks down thick tissue)\n– Physiotherapy exercises or ultrasound\n– Surgery to release tight tissue\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments with dummy treatments (placebo) or no active treatment, or with each other. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that included 2176 adults with OSF. Most studies gave all people help to stop areca nut chewing. Studies tested many different treatments, and follow-up times ranged from under 3 months to more than 6 months. The studies did not report funding sources. No study reported whether people returned to normal eating, chewing, or speech.\n\nMain results\n- Antioxidants compared with placebo or no active treatment:\n  – Mouth opening (the distance between your front teeth when you open wide): Antioxidants may increase mouth opening slightly in the first few months. Antioxidants probably increase mouth opening slightly at 3 to 6 months. After 6 months, antioxidants may make little to no difference to mouth opening. These changes were small and may not be noticeable to many people.\n  – Burning mouth sensation (measured on a simple rating scale): Antioxidants probably reduce burning mouth sensation over the short and longer term.\n\n- Pentoxifylline compared with placebo or no active treatment:\n  – Mouth opening: Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. Again, the changes were small and may not be noticeable to many people.\n\n- Other treatments compared with placebo or no active treatment:\n  – For steroid injections, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase, physiotherapy, and vasodilators, it is unclear if they help. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nUnwanted effects (harms)\nFifteen studies reported unwanted effects. Six studies reported none. One surgery (abdominal fat graft) led to serious problems and longer hospital stays for a few people. Mild and short-lived stomach symptoms (indigestion, belly pain, bloating, nausea) were reported with some medicines, especially vasodilators and antioxidants. Overall, we do not have enough information to make firm judgements about harms for most treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of these findings because many studies were small and used methods that make the results less reliable. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. The studies tested many different treatments and measured results in different ways. Importantly, studies did not measure outcomes that matter most in daily life, such as being able to eat, chew, and speak normally. There were also too few good-quality studies to be certain about unwanted effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
