    "output": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes cleaning the bowel with laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) plus oral antibiotics help prevent problems after planned colon or rectal surgery?\n\nKey Messages\n- Using laxatives plus oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery probably reduces wound infections (infections at the cut) and leaks from the bowel join compared with using laxatives alone. It probably makes little to no difference to death or time in hospital, and may make little to no difference to the bowel being slow to start working after surgery (postoperative ileus). Only a few studies reported side effects. They did not track problems like dehydration or salt imbalance, so we do not know much about harms.\n- We do not know if adding laxatives to oral antibiotics helps compared with using oral antibiotics alone. We also do not know if skipping bowel preparation altogether changes the risk of problems after surgery, because the evidence is limited and methods differed between studies.\n- Future studies should compare oral antibiotics alone with laxatives plus oral antibiotics, include people having different types of bowel surgery, and carefully record side effects and comfort for people.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is planned colon or rectal surgery, and why do infections and leaks matter?\nPlanned colon or rectal surgery (elective colorectal surgery) is an operation on the large bowel or back passage that is scheduled ahead of time. People may have this surgery for cancer or for non-cancer conditions, such as diverticular disease or bowel blockage.\n\nTwo serious problems can happen after this surgery. One is a wound infection, which is an infection at or under the skin cut. The other is an anastomotic leak. This is a leak from the place where the surgeon joins two ends of bowel. These problems can slow recovery and affect long-term health.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation and how might it help?\nThe large bowel naturally contains many bacteria. Before surgery, some teams clean the bowel to reduce bacteria and stool. This is called “bowel preparation.” It can include:\n- laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) to empty the bowel\n- oral antibiotics (antibiotic tablets or liquids taken by mouth) to lower bacteria in the bowel\nMany hospitals also give antibiotics into a vein during surgery to prevent infection. All people in the studies in this review received these antibiotics through a vein.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using laxatives plus oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery prevents wound infections, bowel leaks, and other problems better than:\n- laxatives alone\n- oral antibiotics alone\n- no bowel preparation\n\nHow is bowel preparation given?\nBowel preparation plans vary. They can use different laxatives, different oral antibiotics, and different timings. Some people take them the day before surgery. Others use them over a longer period. This review included many different plans.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies that compared these ways of preparing the bowel before planned colon or rectal surgery. We combined the results and judged how confident we are in the findings based on study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies with 5264 adults having planned colon or rectal surgery for cancer and non-cancer reasons. Most studies included both colon and rectal operations. The types, doses, and timing of laxatives and oral antibiotics varied. All people also received antibiotics into a vein during surgery. The studies took place in several countries. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nOnly 4 studies reported side effects from bowel preparation, and they did not record problems like dehydration, salt imbalance, or stopping treatment due to side effects. This means we know little about harms.\n\nMain results\nLaxatives plus oral antibiotics versus laxatives alone:\n- Wound infections: Adding oral antibiotics to laxatives probably reduces infections.\n- Leaks from the bowel join: Adding oral antibiotics to laxatives probably reduces leaks.\n- Death after surgery: Adding oral antibiotics to laxatives probably makes little to no difference.\n- Postoperative ileus (the bowel is slow to start working after surgery, causing swelling and sickness): Adding oral antibiotics to laxatives may make little to no difference.\n- Length of hospital stay: Adding oral antibiotics to laxatives probably makes little to no difference.\n\nLaxatives plus oral antibiotics versus oral antibiotics alone:\n- Wound infections: It is unclear if adding laxatives to oral antibiotics has an effect.\n- Leaks from the bowel join: Adding laxatives to oral antibiotics may make little to no difference.\n- Death after surgery: Adding laxatives to oral antibiotics may make little to no difference.\n- Postoperative ileus: Adding laxatives to oral antibiotics may make little to no difference.\n- Length of hospital stay: Adding laxatives to oral antibiotics probably makes little to no difference.\n\nLaxatives plus oral antibiotics versus no bowel preparation:\n- Wound infections and death after surgery: We do not know if using laxatives plus oral antibiotics changes these outcomes, because there was only one study and the results were uncertain.\n- Leaks from the bowel join, postoperative ileus, and length of hospital stay: Using laxatives plus oral antibiotics may make little to no difference, but we are not confident in the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident that adding oral antibiotics to laxatives reduces wound infections and leaks compared with laxatives alone. For other questions, we have little confidence because many studies were small, methods were not always clearly described, and the types and doses of antibiotics and laxatives differed. Very few studies reported side effects, and they did not track problems like dehydration or salt imbalance. This makes it hard to judge harms.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021."
