    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\nKey messages:\n* Organisational interventions probably reduce the number of residents with physical restraints and may reduce the duration of physical restraint use.\n* Simple educational interventions may have little or no effect on the number of residents with physical restraints.\n* Future research should focus on interventions in community settings and explore the effects of different types of interventions on the use of physical restraints.\n\nIntroduction:\nPhysical restraints are commonly used in long-term care settings despite evidence of their lack of effectiveness and safety. What can be done to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints? We wanted to find out which interventions work best to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints. We found 11 studies with 19,003 participants.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOrganisational interventions probably reduce the number of residents with physical restraints. Simple educational interventions may have little or no effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence for organisational interventions, but low confidence for simple educational interventions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
