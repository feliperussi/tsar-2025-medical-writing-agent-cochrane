    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n### What are the benefits and drawbacks of healthcare workers using their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices to support their work?\n\n### Key Messages\n- Healthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones and other devices to help them do their jobs, especially when their workplace lacks good communication and information systems. This can be helpful, but it also has some problems.\n- Using personal devices can help healthcare workers be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs, and can even help them build stronger relationships with patients and colleagues. However, it can also create new challenges, such as replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among healthcare workers.\n- We need to think about how to keep the good things about these informal solutions while reducing the bad effects, especially when trying to make healthcare systems stronger.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is the problem with healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work?\nHealthcare workers sometimes come up with their own ways to solve problems at work, like using their personal mobile phones or other devices. This can help them get their job done when their workplace doesn't have good systems in place. However, it can also lead to new challenges.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to explore how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices to support their work, and what benefits and drawbacks these informal solutions have. We looked at the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals in healthcare services.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that explored healthcare workers' use of personal mobile devices for work purposes. We looked at studies from around the world, published between 2008 and 2022, and included 30 studies in our review.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to help them do their jobs, especially in settings where formal communication and information systems are lacking. This can be helpful, as it allows healthcare workers to be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as replicating existing social hierarchies and deepening inequities among healthcare workers.\n\nHealthcare workers may feel pressure to use their personal phones for work, and may even use their personal time and networks to help patients. This can be beneficial, as it allows healthcare workers to build stronger relationships with patients and colleagues. However, it can also create problems, such as breaking patient confidentiality or benefiting some patients more than others.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate to high confidence in our findings, but there are some limitations to the evidence. The studies we looked at were mostly from high-, middle-, and low-income countries, and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. However, most of the studies described mobile phone use, rather than other mobile devices.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
