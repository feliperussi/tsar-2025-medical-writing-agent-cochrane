    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of fenestrated endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n\nKey Messages:\n- We did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- The lack of evidence makes it difficult to determine the benefits and risks of fenestrated endovascular repair for this condition.\n- Future studies should focus on generating high-quality evidence in this area, possibly by commissioning agreements that mandate patient inclusion in studies.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims:\nWhat are abdominal aortic aneurysms?\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms are abnormal dilatations of the aorta that can become life-threatening if they rupture.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and risks of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because we did not find any studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
