    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n### What are the benefits and risks of percutaneous nephrolithotomy versus retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\n### Key Messages\n- We found that percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) at removing kidney stones, but the evidence is not very strong. This means that more people who had PCNL were stone-free after the procedure compared to those who had RIRS.\n- PCNL probably does not increase the risk of major complications compared to RIRS, but again, the evidence is not very strong. This suggests that the risk of serious problems is likely similar between the two procedures.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of PCNL and RIRS for treating kidney stones, especially in terms of how they affect people's quality of life and need for follow-up medical care.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones can cause severe pain, blockage, and infection. Treatment options vary depending on the size, location, and type of stone, as well as the patient's overall health. Common treatments include watching and waiting, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of PCNL versus RIRS for treating kidney stones in adults. Specifically, we looked at how well each procedure removed stones, the rate of major complications, the need for additional procedures, and other important outcomes like hospital stay length and quality of life.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared PCNL to RIRS for kidney stone treatment. We then summarized and evaluated the results of these studies to understand the benefits and risks of each procedure.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe included 42 studies in our review, involving 4571 participants. The studies compared PCNL to RIRS in terms of stone removal, complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes. We found that PCNL may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions compared to RIRS. However, PCNL probably has little to no effect on major complications and may increase the length of hospital stay. Unfortunately, the evidence for most outcomes was of low certainty due to shortcomings in the included trials.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had significant shortcomings, such as not reporting funding sources or conflicts of interest, and the results varied widely across studies. This means that while we can see some potential benefits of PCNL over RIRS, we are not very sure about these findings.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
