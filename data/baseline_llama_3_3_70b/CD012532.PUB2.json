    "output": "Can anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies help people with glioma? What are the benefits and risks of using these treatments for glioma? Are anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies effective in treating glioma?\n\n### Key Messages\n- Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies may not be effective in treating glioma. The evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed to determine their effectiveness.\n- The evidence for the benefits and risks of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in treating glioma is limited, and it is unclear if these treatments can improve outcomes for people with glioma.\n- More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in treating glioma, including their potential benefits and risks.\n\n### Introduction to the Review Topic and Review Aims\n#### What is Glioma?\nGlioma is a type of brain cancer that can be very aggressive. It is the most common type of brain cancer in adults, and it can be difficult to treat. Glioma can cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, seizures, and changes in vision or speech.\n\n#### Why is it Important to Find New Treatments for Glioma?\nGlioma is a serious disease that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. Current treatments for glioma, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, can have significant side effects and may not always be effective. Therefore, it is essential to find new and better treatments for glioma.\n\n#### What are Anti-PD-1 and Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies?\nAnti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are a type of immunotherapy that may help treat glioma. They work by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have shown promise in treating other types of cancer, and researchers are now studying their effectiveness in treating glioma.\n\n#### What Did We Want to Find Out?\nWe wanted to find out if anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are effective in treating glioma. We also wanted to know about the potential benefits and risks of using these treatments.\n\n### What Did We Do?\nWe searched for studies that compared anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies to other treatments for glioma. We looked at the results of these studies to see if anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies can improve outcomes for people with glioma.\n\n### What Did We Find?\nThe evidence suggests that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies may not be effective in treating glioma. However, the evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed to determine their effectiveness. We found that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies may not improve overall survival or progression-free survival for people with glioma. However, the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n### What Are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nThe evidence is based on a small number of studies, and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in treating glioma. The studies that have been done so far have had mixed results, and it is unclear if anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies can improve outcomes for people with glioma.\n\n### How Up to Date is This Evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024. However, new research is being done all the time, and it is possible that new evidence may become available in the future."
