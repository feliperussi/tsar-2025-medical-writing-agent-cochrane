    "output": "Can closing defects during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias? What are the benefits and risks of this procedure?\n\n### Key Messages\n- Closing defects during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernias, but the evidence is not strong. We found that closing defects might lower the chance of getting an internal hernia, but we are not very sure about this because the studies had some limitations.\n- There was little to no difference in the risk of complications or death after surgery between people who had their defects closed and those who did not. This means that closing defects does not seem to increase or decrease the risk of having problems after surgery.\n- The length of hospital stay may be longer for people who had their defects closed, but we are very uncertain about this. We need more research to understand if closing defects really affects how long people stay in the hospital after surgery.\n- More research is needed to confirm these findings and provide clearer guidance for surgeons and patients. This is because the current evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer, and we want to make sure that any recommendations we make are based on the best possible information.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is a type of weight-loss surgery that involves creating a small pouch from the stomach and connecting it directly to the small intestine. This surgery is often used to help people with obesity lose weight and improve their health.\n\n#### Why is it important to prevent internal hernias after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery?\nInternal hernias are a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. They happen when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or hole in the abdominal wall, which can cause severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. If not treated promptly, internal hernias can lead to more serious problems, such as bowel obstruction or even death. Preventing internal hernias is crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of people who undergo this type of surgery.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if closing defects during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery can help prevent internal hernias. We also wanted to know if closing defects has any benefits or risks, such as reducing the risk of complications or death after surgery.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared closing defects with not closing them in people who had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity. We found three studies with 3010 participants and analyzed the results.\n\n### What did we find?\nThe studies suggest that closing defects may reduce the risk of internal hernias, but the evidence is not strong. There was little to no difference in the risk of complications or death after surgery between the two groups. However, the length of hospital stay may be longer for those who had their defects closed. We are not confident in the evidence due to the small number of studies and limitations in their design.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had some limitations. The number of studies was small, and the studies themselves had some flaws in their design. This means that we cannot be very sure about the results, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is based on studies that were published up to August 2024, and we are confident that our findings reflect the current state of knowledge on this topic."
