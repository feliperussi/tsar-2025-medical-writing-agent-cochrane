    "output": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after a pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, to help adults recover and reduce complications?\n\n### Key Messages\n* We found that using a tube to feed people directly into their intestines, called enteral nutrition, might help them leave the hospital a little sooner than if they received nutrition through an intravenous line, called parenteral nutrition. However, we are not very confident in this finding because the studies we looked at had some limitations.\n* We also found that there might be little to no difference in how well people recover when comparing different types of enteral nutrition or when comparing enteral nutrition to eating normally after surgery. But again, we are not very confident in these findings.\n* More research is needed to figure out the best way to support nutrition after a Whipple procedure. The evidence we have so far is not strong enough to make firm conclusions, and there are many different nutritional interventions that could be used.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is a Whipple procedure? \nA Whipple procedure, also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy, is a type of surgery that involves removing the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, the gallbladder, and part of the stomach. This surgery is usually done to remove a tumor or to treat other conditions that affect the pancreas and surrounding tissues.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out which nutritional support strategies work best for people who have had a Whipple procedure. We looked at studies that compared different ways of providing nutrition after surgery, such as through a tube in the nose or mouth, or through an intravenous line.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different nutritional support strategies after a Whipple procedure. We looked at studies that compared enteral nutrition, which involves feeding people through a tube directly into their intestines, with parenteral nutrition, which involves providing nutrition through an intravenous line. We also looked at studies that compared different types of enteral nutrition, such as feeding through a tube in the nose or mouth, with eating normally after surgery.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 17 studies that compared different nutritional support strategies after a Whipple procedure. These studies involved a total of 1897 people. We found that using a tube to feed people directly into their intestines, called enteral nutrition, might help them leave the hospital a little sooner than if they received nutrition through an intravenous line, called parenteral nutrition. However, we are not very confident in this finding because the studies we looked at had some limitations. We also found that there might be little to no difference in how well people recover when comparing different types of enteral nutrition or when comparing enteral nutrition to eating normally after surgery. But again, we are not very confident in these findings.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies we looked at had some limitations. The studies were small, and they did not provide enough information about the people who participated in the studies. Additionally, the studies did not always compare the same types of nutritional support strategies, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
