    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of removing a urinary catheter early versus late after kidney transplantation?\n\nKey messages:\n* Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain whether removing the urinary catheter early or late after kidney transplantation makes any difference to the risk of urinary tract infections or other complications.\n* More research is needed to find out the best time to remove the catheter.\n* We do not know if removing the catheter early or late has any effect on the risk of infections or complications because the evidence is of very low certainty.\n\nIntroduction:\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter is placed in the bladder to help it drain. However, the catheter can increase the risk of infection. The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the outcomes of patients who had their catheter removed early, less than 5 days after surgery, to those who had it removed later, 5 days or more after surgery. We were interested in finding out if there were any differences in the risk of urinary tract infections, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and major urological complications between the two groups.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared early and late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation and summarized their results. We looked for studies that included patients of all ages and demographics, and we did not exclude any studies based on the type of urinary catheter used.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies with 197 patients. However, the quality of the evidence was very low, and it is uncertain whether early or late removal of the catheter makes any difference to the risk of infections or complications. The studies were small, and the follow-up period was short, with no patients being followed beyond one month.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and of poor quality. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally high or unclear, which means that the results may not be reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
