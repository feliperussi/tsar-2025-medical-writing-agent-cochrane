    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old?\n\nKey Messages:\n- Interventions to prevent obesity in children may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up.\n- Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference.\n- Limited evidence of low quality was identified on the effect of dietary and/or activity interventions on severe adverse events and health inequalities.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims:\nWhat can people do to prevent obesity in children?\nPrevention of obesity in children is an international public health priority given the prevalence of the condition and its significant impact on health, development, and well-being.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which approaches are more effective in preventing obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or activity levels, or a combination of both, on changes in BMI, zBMI score, and serious adverse events.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity interventions to prevent obesity with no intervention, usual care, or with another eligible intervention, in any setting.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies that involved 189,707 participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
