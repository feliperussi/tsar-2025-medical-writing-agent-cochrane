    "output": "What are the best treatments for blocked arteriovenous fistulas and grafts in people having dialysis?\n\n### Key Messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to say that one treatment is better than another for unblocking arteriovenous fistulas and grafts in people having dialysis. The treatments we looked at included surgery, using medicines to dissolve blood clots, and other methods.\n- Surgery might be better than using a machine to remove the blood clot for keeping the fistula or graft open after treatment, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- More research is needed to find out which treatments work best and are safest for people having dialysis, as the current evidence is limited and not very reliable.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What are arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nArteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are used for people who need dialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are not working properly. An AVF is a connection between an artery and a vein, made by surgery, while an AVG is a tube made of synthetic material that connects an artery and a vein. These connections allow for easier access to the bloodstream for dialysis.\n\n#### Why is it a problem when they get blocked?\nWhen AVFs or AVGs get blocked, it can lead to serious complications, including the need for temporary catheters, which increase the risk of infections and other problems. It's essential to find the best way to unblock these fistulas and grafts to ensure people can continue their dialysis treatment safely and effectively.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which treatments work best to unblock AVFs and AVGs, and if some treatments are safer than others. We looked at studies that compared different ways to treat blocked fistulas and grafts, including surgery, using medicines to dissolve blood clots, and other methods.\n\n### What are the treatments for blocked arteriovenous fistulas and grafts?\nTreatments for blocked AVFs and AVGs include surgical procedures to remove the blockage, using medicines to dissolve the blood clot (thrombolysis), and mechanical methods to remove the clot (thrombectomy). The choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the cause of the blockage and the individual's overall health.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for blocked AVFs and AVGs in people having dialysis. We looked at the results of these studies to see which treatments were most effective and safest.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies with 1176 people, but most of these studies had problems that might affect the results. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to say that one treatment is better than another. However, we did find that surgery might be better than using a machine to remove the blood clot for keeping the fistula or graft open after treatment. More research is needed to find out which treatments work best and are safest for people having dialysis.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies we found had several problems, including poor design and a small number of participants. Most of the studies were also funded by industry, which could affect the results. The evidence is very uncertain, and more research is needed to find out which treatments are best.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to January 2024."
