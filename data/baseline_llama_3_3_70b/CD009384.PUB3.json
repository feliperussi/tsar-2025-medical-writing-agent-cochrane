    "output": "Can zinc supplements help prevent illness and death in children aged 6 months to 12 years? What are the benefits and risks of zinc supplementation for children in this age group?\n\n### Key Messages\n- Zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and improve growth slightly in children aged 6 months to 12 years, but the evidence is not strong.\n- We are moderately confident that zinc supplements can help prevent diarrhea, but we are not confident that they can prevent death from diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, or malaria.\n- Zinc supplements may cause vomiting in some children, and we need more research to understand the benefits and risks of zinc supplements for children.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is zinc deficiency, and why is it a problem? \nZinc deficiency is common in low- and middle-income countries and can lead to serious health problems, including increased risk of illness and death, and poor growth in children. \n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if zinc supplements can help prevent mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years. We searched for studies that compared zinc supplements with no supplements or a placebo.\n\n### How is zinc deficiency treated or prevented?\nZinc deficiency can be treated or prevented with zinc supplements, which can be given as a syrup or tablet. The most common dose is between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. \n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared zinc supplements with no supplements or a placebo. We found 96 studies with over 219,000 participants. \n\n### What did we find?\nThe studies showed that zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and improve growth slightly, but the evidence is not strong. We are moderately confident that zinc supplements can help prevent diarrhea, but we are not confident that they can prevent death from diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, or malaria. Zinc supplements may cause vomiting in some children. \n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were not all well-designed, and some of them were small. We need more research to understand the benefits and risks of zinc supplements for children. \n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
