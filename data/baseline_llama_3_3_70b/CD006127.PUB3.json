    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes to prevent diabetic retinopathy?\n\n### Key Messages\n- Controlling blood pressure may help prevent diabetic retinopathy, especially in people with high blood pressure, but we are not sure if it helps prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n- The evidence suggests that controlling blood pressure can be beneficial for people with diabetes, but more research is needed to understand its effects on other outcomes such as visual acuity.\n- We need more studies to confirm the benefits and risks of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes to prevent diabetic retinopathy.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy? \nDiabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness if not treated. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, which is the part of the eye that senses light. Controlling blood pressure is important for people with diabetes because high blood pressure can make diabetic retinopathy worse.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure can help prevent diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes. We looked at studies that compared different ways of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes to see if it helped prevent diabetic retinopathy.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes to see if it helped prevent diabetic retinopathy. We combined and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that compared different ways of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes. These studies included a total of 27,185 people with diabetes. The studies were conducted in many different countries and lasted from less than one year to nine years. We found that controlling blood pressure can help prevent diabetic retinopathy, especially in people with high blood pressure. However, we are not sure if controlling blood pressure helps prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy or affects other outcomes such as visual acuity.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very different from each other and some of them were small. We are not sure if the results of these studies apply to all people with diabetes. More research is needed to confirm the benefits and risks of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes to prevent diabetic retinopathy.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.\n\nNote: This Plain Language Summary is based on the provided Cochrane abstract and follows the guidelines for transforming complex medical abstracts into accessible language. The summary aims to make the health evidence accessible to people without medical knowledge, including patients, caregivers, and the general public."
