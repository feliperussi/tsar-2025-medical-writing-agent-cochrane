    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey Messages:\n* Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics may help reduce anxiety and depression in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not very strong.\n* The effect of psychedelic-assisted therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on anxiety and depression is very uncertain.\n* We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims:\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that uses psychedelics, such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide, in combination with therapy sessions to help people with anxiety, depression, and existential distress. This type of therapy has been studied as a potential treatment for people with life-threatening diseases.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, and what the potential benefits and risks are.\n\nHow is anxiety, depression, and existential distress treated?\nAnxiety, depression, and existential distress are commonly treated with medications, such as antidepressants, and therapy sessions. However, some people may not respond to these treatments, and that's where psychedelic-assisted therapy comes in.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We included six studies in the review, which evaluated two different interventions: psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics and psychedelic-assisted therapy with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics may result in a reduction in anxiety and depression when compared to active placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. The effect of psychedelic-assisted therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on anxiety and depression is very uncertain. We also found that psychedelic-assisted therapy seemed to be well tolerated, with no treatment-emergent serious adverse events reported in the studies included in this review.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. The evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
