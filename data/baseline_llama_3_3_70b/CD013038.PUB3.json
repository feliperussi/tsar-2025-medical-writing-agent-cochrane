    "output": "Can exposure to the smell and taste of milk help preterm infants start sucking feeds earlier? What are the benefits and risks of this approach?\n\n## Key Messages\n- We wanted to find out if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed can help them start sucking feeds earlier, and if it is safe. The evidence suggests that exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time taken to reach full sucking feeds.\n- We also found that the intervention may have little to no effect on duration of parenteral nutrition, time to reach full enteral feeds, or risk of necrotising enterocolitis. However, the evidence is not strong, and we are not confident in the results.\n- Future research should examine the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on health outcomes during hospitalisation, such as attainment of feeding skills, safety, feed tolerance, infection, and growth.\n\n## Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n### What is the problem with feeding preterm infants?\nPreterm infants, born before 37 weeks of gestation, often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing for oral feeding due to their immaturity. This leads to initial nutrition being provided through orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, feeding intolerance is common and can delay the attainment of full enteral and sucking feeds, prolonging the need for nutritional support and hospital stay.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess whether exposure to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula administered with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared tube-feeding with and without the smell and taste of milk. We found eight studies with 1277 preterm infants and evaluated the evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of this approach.\n\n## What did we find?\nThe evidence suggests that exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time taken to reach full sucking feeds. We also found that the intervention may have little to no effect on duration of parenteral nutrition, time to reach full enteral feeds, or risk of necrotising enterocolitis. However, the evidence is not strong, and we are not confident in the results.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and had methodological limitations, including unclear or lack of randomisation, lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and unclear or lack of blinding of the outcome assessor. These limitations mean that the results may not be reliable, and more research is needed to confirm the findings.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
