    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women?\n\n### Key Messages\n* We found that some approaches to pelvic floor muscle training may be better than others for helping women with urinary incontinence, but for some approaches, there was little or no difference. The benefits and risks of these approaches are not well understood due to limited evidence.\n* The evidence suggests that direct pelvic floor muscle training, which involves repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles, may result in a small improvement in incontinence quality of life compared to indirect training. However, the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n* We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. This means that we cannot be certain about the benefits and risks of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is urinary incontinence, and how is it treated? Urinary incontinence is a common problem that affects many women. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including childbirth, menopause, and certain medical conditions. Pelvic floor muscle training is a recommended treatment for urinary incontinence. It involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to help improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which types of pelvic floor muscle training work best to help women with urinary incontinence and what the benefits and risks are. We compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. We compared and summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that some approaches to pelvic floor muscle training may be better than others for helping women with urinary incontinence. For example, co-ordinated training, which involves body movements with concurrent pelvic floor muscle contraction, may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct pelvic floor muscle training. However, the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n\nWe also found that indirect training, which involves exercises that are not contractions of the pelvic floor muscles, may not be as effective as direct pelvic floor muscle training. However, combining indirect training with direct pelvic floor muscle training may make little to no difference in quality of life.\n\nIn terms of exercise dose, we found that pelvic floor muscle training with a resistance device may not be as effective as pelvic floor muscle training without a resistance device. However, the evidence is very uncertain, and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n\nWe also found that supervising pelvic floor muscle training in a clinic may slightly improve quality of life compared to supervising at home. However, the evidence is very uncertain, and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. This means that we cannot be certain about the benefits and risks of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023."
