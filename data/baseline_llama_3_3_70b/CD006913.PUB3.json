    "output": "Can psychological interventions improve quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\n### Key Messages\n* Psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, may slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety in adults with inflammatory bowel disease, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the effects on disease activity.\n* In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy may increase quality of life, but the results are not conclusive for anxiety and depression.\n* Further research is needed to explore the effects of psychological interventions on inflammatory bowel disease, as the current evidence is limited by the complexity and variability of the interventions and the studies.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are at increased risk of suffering from psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nWhat can people do to manage inflammatory bowel disease? While there are various treatments available for IBD, such as medications and surgery, psychological interventions may also play a role in improving quality of life and emotional state. Psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, aim to help people with IBD manage their symptoms and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease. We searched for studies that compared psychological interventions with no therapy, sham therapy, or other active treatments in people with IBD.\n\n### How is inflammatory bowel disease treated?\nInflammatory bowel disease is typically treated with medications, such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators, to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged portions of the digestive tract. Additionally, lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and stress management, may also be recommended to help manage symptoms.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological interventions with no therapy, sham therapy, or other active treatments in people with inflammatory bowel disease. We found 68 studies, and most of them used multimodular approaches. We evaluated the quality of the evidence and assessed the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, depression, anxiety, and disease activity.\n\n### What did we find?\nThe results showed that psychological interventions can slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety in adults, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the effects on disease activity. In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy may increase quality of life. However, the results are not conclusive for anxiety and depression. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there was a high risk of bias in the included trials. The main issues leading to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were heterogeneity of results, low precision, and high or moderate risk of bias in the included trials. Publication bias could not be shown for any of the inspected analyses.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is based on studies that were published up to May 2023, and we are confident that it reflects the current state of knowledge on the effects of psychological interventions for inflammatory bowel disease."
