    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for treating chronic suppurative otitis media?\n\n### Key Messages\n* We found that topical antibiotics may increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to some topical antiseptics, but the evidence is limited and uncertain. \n* Topical quinolones are likely to increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks compared with boric acid ear drops. \n* Future research should focus on providing more robust evidence on the benefits and harms of different treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media? \nChronic suppurative otitis media, sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of chronic suppurative otitis media are ear discharge and hearing loss.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out which treatment works better to treat this condition. We compared antibiotics with topical antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.\n\n### How is chronic suppurative otitis media treated?\nChronic suppurative otitis media can be treated with antibiotics or topical antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotics with topical antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media. We used standard Cochrane methodology to summarize and analyze the results.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 15 studies with 2371 participants. The evidence suggests that topical antibiotics may increase resolution of ear discharge compared to some topical antiseptics, but the evidence is limited and uncertain. We are moderately confident that topical quinolones increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks compared with boric acid ear drops.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for other comparisons due to limitations in the quality of included studies and lack of recent data. The evidence is very uncertain for serious complications or suspected ototoxicity.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
