    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n### Key Messages\n- Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on improving mental well-being and prosocial behavior in children and adolescents living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. However, these interventions may improve functioning in this group, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- In adults, psychosocial interventions may slightly improve mental well-being, but the evidence is not strong enough to be confident in this finding. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect of these interventions on functioning and prosocial behavior in adults.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of psychosocial interventions for promoting mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises, as the current evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is the problem?\nAbout 84 million people are forcibly displaced around the world due to wars, conflicts, persecutions, human rights violations, and humanitarian crises. Most of these people live in low- and middle-income countries. The stress of living in these situations can affect their mental health. \n\n#### Why is it important to promote mental health?\nPromoting mental health is important because it can help people cope with stress and improve their overall well-being. Psychosocial interventions, which include psychological and social support, may be helpful in promoting positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychosocial interventions can help promote mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We looked at studies that compared psychosocial interventions to control conditions, such as no intervention or usual care.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial interventions to control conditions in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We summarized and combined the results of these studies and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that included 7917 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in children and adolescents, and a few were conducted in adults. The studies were done in different countries, including Lebanon, India, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The interventions were usually delivered in groups by paraprofessionals, who are individuals who are not mental health professionals but work with people seeking mental health care.\n\nFor children and adolescents, we found that psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on improving mental well-being and prosocial behavior. However, these interventions may improve functioning in this group, but the evidence is very uncertain. In adults, psychosocial interventions may slightly improve mental well-being, but the evidence is not strong enough to be confident in this finding.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, and there were concerns about the quality of the studies. The evidence is also limited because there were not many studies, and the studies that were done were not similar enough to be combined easily.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
