    "output": "Can remote ischaemic preconditioning help reduce complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey Messages:\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning may make little to no difference in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear benefit of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing mortality, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, or hospital stays after surgery.\n- More research is needed to determine the potential benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and how does it work?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning is a technique that involves temporarily blocking blood flow to certain areas of the body before surgery. This is done to help protect the body from damage caused by lack of blood flow during surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if remote ischaemic preconditioning can help reduce complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures. We looked at the results of 14 studies that compared remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We summarized and combined the results of these studies to see if remote ischaemic preconditioning can help reduce complications during surgery.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that remote ischaemic preconditioning may make little to no difference in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures. The evidence suggests that remote ischaemic preconditioning probably leads to little or no difference in perioperative mortality, myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, hospital stay, and operating time.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had some methodological limitations. The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022."
