    "output": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n### 1. Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults?\n\n### 2. Key Messages\n- Ultrasound guidance may help reduce the number of attempts needed to successfully administer neuraxial anaesthesia and may also reduce the time it takes to perform the procedure. However, the evidence for some outcomes, like pain and adverse effects, is very uncertain.\n- The use of ultrasound guidance likely increases the chances of successfully administering neuraxial anaesthesia on the first attempt. \n- Future research should focus on improving the certainty of the evidence, especially regarding participant satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and adverse effects, to better understand the benefits and risks of using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia.\n\n### 3. Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief given near the spine. It can be difficult to administer successfully because the space where the anaesthesia is given can be hard to find just by feeling the body. Successful neuraxial anaesthesia, with as few attempts as possible, is important to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound guidance is better than using anatomical landmarks for giving neuraxial anaesthesia to adults. We looked at how many attempts it takes to successfully give the anaesthesia, how long the procedure takes, and how satisfied patients are with the procedure.\n\n### 4. How is neuraxial anaesthesia typically given?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia can be given using either anatomical landmarks, where the doctor feels the body to find the right spot, or ultrasound guidance, where an ultrasound machine is used to see the inside of the body and find the right spot.\n\n### 5. What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the use of ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We combined the results of these studies to see if one method is better than the other.\n\n### 6. What did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 participants. These studies were done in many parts of the world and included people getting different types of neuraxial anaesthesia. We found that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed to successfully administer neuraxial anaesthesia and reduces the time it takes to perform the procedure. It also likely increases the chances of successfully administering neuraxial anaesthesia on the first attempt. However, the evidence for some outcomes, like pain and adverse effects, is very uncertain.\n\n### 7. What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for some outcomes because the studies were not perfect and some results were very varied. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure and adverse effects. This means we need to be careful when interpreting these results and more research is needed to give clearer answers.\n\n### 8. How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023."
