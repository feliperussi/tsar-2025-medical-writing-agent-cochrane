    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals compared to discarding them in preterm infants?\n\n### Key Messages\n- We found limited data from one small trial on the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants. The evidence suggests that re-feeding gastric residual may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, number of total parenteral nutrition days, and risk of extrauterine growth restriction at discharge.\n- The trial included 72 preterm infants and was of good methodological quality, but it was unmasked, which might have affected the results.\n- A large trial is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding of gastric residuals in preterm infants with adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is the issue with gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have their feeding tubes checked for gastric residuals, which are leftovers from previous feedings. The question is whether these leftovers should be re-fed to the infant or discarded. Re-feeding gastric residuals may help with digestion and the development of the gut, but it could also lead to problems like vomiting or infections.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if re-feeding gastric residuals is better than discarding them for preterm infants. Specifically, we looked at how this practice affects the time it takes for infants to regain their birth weight, their risk of getting a serious infection called necrotising enterocolitis, and other important health outcomes.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding gastric residuals to discarding them in preterm infants. We found one trial that included 72 infants and met our criteria.\n\n### What did we find?\nThe trial suggested that re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important health outcomes for preterm infants. However, the evidence is not strong because the trial was small and not blinded, which means that the people involved in the study knew which infants were being re-fed their gastric residuals and which were not.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and not well-hidden, which could affect the results. More research is needed to give a clear answer about whether re-feeding gastric residuals is beneficial or not for preterm infants.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
