    "output": "How can refractive and optical care services be delivered in community and primary care settings to reduce vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error? \n\n### Key Messages\n- We found that different approaches can be used to deliver refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models in community care, and vision centre, health centre, and combination models in primary care.\n- However, there were prominent gaps in the evaluation of these approaches, and few studies attempted to assess their effectiveness, which makes it difficult to determine the best approach.\n- The findings of this review can help guide healthcare providers and policymakers in strengthening refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels, and in developing effective strategies to reduce vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error? \nVision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It can be managed with the appropriate spectacle correction, but many people, especially in low- and middle-income countries, do not have access to refractive and optical care services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to determine the range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, and the methods employed for their evaluation. This information can help guide the development of technical guidance to support improvements in the testing and correction of refractive error among World Health Organization (WHO) member states.\n\n### What did we do? \nWe searched for studies and reports on different approaches to delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, and extracted data from the included studies. We synthesized the data and presented the results as tables, figures, and case studies.\n\n### What did we find? \nWe identified 175 studies from searches of databases and grey literature, 146 records from company reports, and 81 records from website searches of relevant organizations that matched our inclusion criteria. The approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services in community care included school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models, whereas primary care approaches comprised vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door-to-door delivery.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there were prominent gaps in the evaluation of the approaches, and few studies attempted to assess their effectiveness. This makes it difficult to determine the best approach to delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence? \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022."
