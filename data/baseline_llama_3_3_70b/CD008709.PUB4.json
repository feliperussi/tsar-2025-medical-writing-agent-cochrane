    "output": "## Key Messages\n- Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as other types of sling operations, like retropubic and transobturator slings, in helping women with stress urinary incontinence. However, it's uncertain if they have more or fewer side effects compared to these other types.\n- The evidence about how well single-incision slings work and their side effects is not strong enough to give clear answers. This is because many of the studies had problems that could affect their results, and there were not enough studies to be sure about the long-term effects.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and risks of single-incision sling operations compared to other treatments for stress urinary incontinence.\n\n## Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n### What is stress urinary incontinence?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they do things that put pressure on their bladder, like coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It's a common problem that can affect a woman's quality of life and can be embarrassing.\n\n### Why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence can make everyday activities difficult and affect a woman's self-esteem and confidence. It's also a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society.\n\n### What are single-incision sling operations?\nSingle-incision sling operations are a type of surgery used to treat stress urinary incontinence. They involve placing a small synthetic device under the urethra to support it and prevent leakage. This type of surgery is less invasive than traditional sling operations and is intended to reduce recovery time and complications.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well single-incision sling operations work compared to other types of sling operations and other treatments for stress urinary incontinence. We also wanted to understand the benefits and risks of this type of surgery.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision sling operations to other treatments for stress urinary incontinence. We looked at the results of these studies to see how well single-incision sling operations worked and what side effects they had.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that included a total of 8051 women. These studies compared single-incision sling operations to other types of sling operations, like retropubic and transobturator slings. We found that single-incision sling operations may be as effective as these other types of sling operations in helping women with stress urinary incontinence. However, we're not sure if they have more or fewer side effects.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had problems that could affect their results. Many of the studies were small, and some of them did not report all the information we needed. We're also not sure about the long-term effects of single-incision sling operations because most of the studies only followed women for a short time.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nNote: The provided response is a Plain Language Summary of the given Cochrane abstract, following the specified guidelines and structure. It aims to make the information accessible to readers without medical knowledge, using simple and conversational language."
