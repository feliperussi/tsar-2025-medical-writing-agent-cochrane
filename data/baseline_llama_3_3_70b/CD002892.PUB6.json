    "output": "Can individual-level interventions reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers?\n\nKey Messages:\n- Individual-level stress interventions may help reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers, but the evidence is not very strong.\n- Interventions that focus on the experience of stress or away from it may both be beneficial, at least in the short term.\n- We are not sure which type of intervention works best or if combining them is more effective because the evidence is very uncertain.\n- More research is needed, especially on interventions that target work-related risk factors and on the long-term effects of these interventions.\n\nWhat can healthcare workers do to manage stress?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to high demands, lack of skills, and poor social support at work. This can lead to burnout, psychosomatic problems, and decreased quality of care. Common ways to manage stress include mindfulness, exercise, and seeking social support.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual-level interventions in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers compared to no intervention or other types of interventions.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that investigated the effects of individual-level stress interventions on healthcare workers and summarized their results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies with over 11,000 participants that tested various individual-level interventions. These interventions included focusing on the experience of stress, focusing away from it, altering work-related factors, or combining these approaches. The evidence suggests that these interventions may reduce stress symptoms in the short and medium term, but it is very uncertain for long-term effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had methodological limitations, such as lack of blinding and small sample sizes. More research with better-designed studies is needed to increase the certainty of the evidence.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review and is current up to February 2022."
