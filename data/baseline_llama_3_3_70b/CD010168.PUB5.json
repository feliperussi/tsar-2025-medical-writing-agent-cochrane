    "output": "## Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of using abdominal drainage to prevent abscesses after surgery for complicated appendicitis?\n\n## Key Messages\n* The evidence is very uncertain about whether using abdominal drainage after surgery for complicated appendicitis helps prevent abscesses, wound infections, or other complications. Abdominal drainage may increase the risk of death and hospital stay, but the evidence is not clear.\n* We did not find enough good-quality evidence to compare different types of drains or to determine the best time to remove drains.\n* More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of abdominal drainage after surgery for complicated appendicitis, especially to find out if it affects the risk of death.\n\n## Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n### What is appendicitis and why is it a problem?\nAppendicitis is a condition where the appendix, a small part of the intestine, becomes inflamed. This can be very painful and, if not treated, can lead to serious complications. Surgery to remove the appendix, called an appendectomy, is often necessary. However, people who have surgery for complicated appendicitis, which means the appendix has burst or is gangrenous, are more likely to have problems after the operation.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if using abdominal drainage after surgery for complicated appendicitis helps prevent abscesses, which are collections of pus that can form in the abdomen. We also wanted to compare different types of drains and find out the best time to remove them.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using abdominal drainage with not using it after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We also looked for studies that compared different types of drains and different schedules for removing drains.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found eight studies that included a total of 739 people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis. The studies were done in different parts of the world and included both children and adults. Most of the people in the studies had perforated appendicitis, which means the appendix had burst. All of the people in the studies received antibiotics after their surgery.\n\nThe evidence from these studies is very uncertain about whether abdominal drainage helps prevent abscesses, wound infections, or other complications. We found that abdominal drainage may increase the risk of death and hospital stay, but the evidence is not clear. We did not find any studies that compared different types of drains or that looked at the best time to remove drains.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had problems with how they were designed and carried out. This means that we cannot be sure if the results are due to the treatment or to other factors. More research is needed to provide clearer answers.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023."
