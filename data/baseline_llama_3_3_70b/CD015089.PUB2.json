    "output": "## Plain Language Summary Title\nCan the HINTS examination accurately diagnose central causes of acute vestibular syndrome?\n\n## Key Messages\n- The HINTS examination is a test used by clinicians to determine if a person's dizziness is caused by a central or peripheral issue. We found that the HINTS examination is good at identifying central causes of dizziness, but the evidence is not very strong. \n- The HINTS Plus examination, which includes an additional assessment of hearing, may also be useful, but we need more research to confirm this. \n- More studies are needed to understand how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations work in different settings and with different types of healthcare providers.\n\n## Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n### What is acute vestibular syndrome?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can be severe and include symptoms like vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and unsteadiness. It's essential to figure out what's causing AVS because the treatment and outcomes can be very different depending on whether it's caused by a central (related to the brain) or peripheral (related to the inner ear) issue.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how accurate the HINTS examination is in diagnosing central causes of AVS. The HINTS examination is a three-part test that looks at how the eyes move when the head is turned quickly, the direction of involuntary eye movements, and whether the eyes are aligned properly. We also looked at the HINTS Plus examination, which adds a check of hearing.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that evaluated the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of AVS. We looked at how these tests were used in different settings, like emergency departments and clinics, and by different types of healthcare providers.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants. Most of these studies were done in emergency departments, and about half were performed by neurologists. The HINTS examination was found to be quite sensitive (meaning it's good at detecting central causes when they are present) and reasonably specific (meaning it's fairly good at ruling out central causes when they are not present). However, the evidence for its accuracy is not very strong. The HINTS Plus examination also showed promise, but we need more research to be sure about its usefulness.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had some flaws, such as not being clear about how participants were selected or how the tests were performed. Also, most of the studies were done in emergency departments by physicians, so we don't know how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations work in other settings or with other types of healthcare providers.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
