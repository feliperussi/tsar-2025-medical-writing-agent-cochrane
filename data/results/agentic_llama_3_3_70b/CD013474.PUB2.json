  "text": "What is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nMaintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow) may help keep the disease from getting worse and may improve survival. However, it can also cause unwanted effects such as infections, fatigue (feeling extremely tired), and a higher risk of other health problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well maintenance therapy works for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, including treatments like anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that helps the immune system fight cancer) and immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system work better). We looked at how these treatments affect overall survival, health-related quality of life, and side effects.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared different maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We looked at studies that compared these therapies to no treatment or to a placebo (a dummy treatment). We found 11 studies that met our criteria, which included 2393 participants.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies may help keep the disease from getting worse, but may also increase the risk of serious side effects. Immunomodulatory drugs may also help keep the disease from getting worse, but may increase the risk of side effects. We did not find enough evidence to say whether these treatments improve overall survival or health-related quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes. We are not sure if the results would be the same in a larger group of people.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may help keep the disease from getting worse and may improve survival, but it can also cause unwanted effects.\n- Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs may help keep the disease from getting worse, but may also increase the risk of side effects.\n- We need more research to fully understand the effects of maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.",
