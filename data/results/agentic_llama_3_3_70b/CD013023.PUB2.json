They are commonly used in intensive care units and operating rooms. However, these catheters can sometimes fail or become dislodged, leading to complications such as infection, bleeding, or nerve damage. To prevent these complications, dressings and securement devices are used to keep the catheter in place and maintain its function.\n\nWhat are the problems with peripheral arterial catheters?\nDespite their importance, peripheral arterial catheters often fail, requiring reinsertion, which can be painful and increase the risk of complications. Infections, such as those that spread through the bloodstream, can also occur. Furthermore, the catheter can become dislodged or occluded, leading to inaccurate blood pressure readings or requiring additional medical procedures to correct. These complications can lead to longer hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices in preventing complications, such as catheter failure, infection, and dislodgement, in people with peripheral arterial catheters. We aimed to determine which types of dressings and securement devices are most effective in maintaining catheter function and preventing complications, and to identify the best ways to secure and dress peripheral arterial catheters to minimize the risk of adverse events.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. The studies compared different dressing and securement devices, including standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings. Different dressing and securement devices may not significantly reduce the risk of catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, or occlusion. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.\n\nWe searched for studies comparing different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 5 studies with 1228 participants and found that the use of different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters may make little to no difference in the risk of catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, or occlusion. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings.",
