  "text": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and improve their quality of life?\n\n- Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure, but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality rates.\n- Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure, and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a hospital.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting more diverse groups of people with heart failure, including older adults, women, and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, to better understand how exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can help these individuals.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should, which can lead to low energy, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs. It affects many people worldwide and can greatly impact their quality of life, increasing the risk of death and hospitalization. Common treatments for heart failure include medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgery or devices to support the heart.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can improve the health and well-being of adults with heart failure. Specifically, they looked at whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can reduce the risk of death, hospital admissions, and improve health-related quality of life compared to usual care without exercise.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation with a no-exercise control in adults with heart failure. Data were extracted on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life, and the confidence in the evidence was assessed.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted with a median follow-up of six months. Most existing evidence includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, specifically those with New York Heart Association classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction undertaking exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in a home-based setting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
