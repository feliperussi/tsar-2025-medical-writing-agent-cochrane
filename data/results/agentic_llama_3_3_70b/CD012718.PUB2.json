If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals, but these can be expensive and may not always be accessible to everyone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of SDF for preventing and managing tooth decay in children and adults, compared to other treatments. They aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SDF in preventing new tooth decay, arresting existing tooth decay, and preventing the progression of tooth decay, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared SDF with other interventions for preventing and managing tooth decay. The search included keywords and terms related to \"silver diamine fluoride\", \"tooth decay\", \"prevention\", and \"management\" without language or date restrictions.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nStudies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, or cohort studies that directly compared SDF to another preventive or therapeutic tooth decay intervention, reported relevant outcomes, and provided sufficient data for extraction.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies were conducted in various countries. Most studies compared SDF with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of SDF, or SDF with other interventions like fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment with glass ionomer cement or GI material.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
