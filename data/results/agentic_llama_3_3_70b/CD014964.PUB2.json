  "text": "Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for giving regional anesthesia to adults?\n\nWe compared two methods for giving regional anesthesia - ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks. Regional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body.\n\n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. \n- It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these findings.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anesthesia and why is it important?\nNeuraxial anesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anesthesia in adults. They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes to perform the procedure.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries and were published between 2001 and 2023. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sample sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
