High levels of bilirubin can cause brain damage, so it's essential to treat jaundice promptly. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine whether intermittent phototherapy is as effective as continuous phototherapy in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing brain damage in jaundiced newborn babies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy in jaundiced infants, both term and preterm, up to the age of 30 days. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to the rate of decline of bilirubin in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",
