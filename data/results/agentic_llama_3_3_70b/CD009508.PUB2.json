  "text": "What are the best approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen muscles in the pelvic area) for treating urinary incontinence in women?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Pelvic floor muscle training may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence, but the evidence is not strong.\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training may be more effective than indirect training, but more research is needed.\n- Future studies should investigate the best approaches to pelvic floor muscle training to provide clearer guidance for women with urinary incontinence.\n\n**What is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?**\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily. It can be embarrassing and affect quality of life. Pelvic floor muscle training is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training on urinary incontinence in women. They compared exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones work best.\n\n**How did the review authors search for evidence?**\nWe searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials that compared different pelvic floor muscle training approaches for urinary incontinence in women.\n\n**What did the review authors find?**\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Direct pelvic floor muscle training may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is limited because many studies had small sample sizes, varied in their methods, and did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
