About 84 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide, with the majority living in these countries. The stressors associated with humanitarian crises can threaten mental health, making it essential to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life.\n### What are psychosocial interventions, and how can they help?\nPsychosocial interventions are programs or activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These interventions can be particularly helpful for people affected by humanitarian crises, as they aim to enhance positive aspects of mental health. Previous reviews have focused on treatment and mixed promotion and prevention interventions, but this review concentrates on the promotion of positive mental health aspects.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on promoting mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior in adults and children. The authors also sought to evaluate the acceptability of these interventions and the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies comparing psychosocial interventions to control conditions in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n### Data Synthesis\nWe summarized and combined the results of these studies.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most of the interventions were delivered to groups of participants, mainly by paraprofessionals. The mean study duration was 18 weeks, with a range of 10 to 32 weeks. The studies were generally funded by grants from academic institutions or non‑governmental organisations. Nine of the studies were conducted on children and adolescents, while four were conducted on adults. The interventions were compared to control conditions, such as no intervention, intervention as usual, or waiting list. Psychosocial interventions may improve mental well‑being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on functioning and prosocial behaviour in adults. The evidence is uncertain, and future studies might either confirm or disallowed these findings.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small, potentially unblinded, did not report all outcomes of interest, and were heterogeneous in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
