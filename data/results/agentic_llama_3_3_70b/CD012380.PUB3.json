It happens when you inherit two abnormal genes that produce haemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen). \n- It can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. \n- One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). \n- These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. \n- We looked at possible interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. \n- The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. \n- The population characteristics varied across the studies, with one study including children aged 9 to 18 months, another including adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, and the third including children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small. \n- Participants may have known which treatment they received. \n- The results do not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.\n\nWe need more research to determine the best treatments for preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Future studies should be well-designed and include older children and adults with sickle cell disease.",
