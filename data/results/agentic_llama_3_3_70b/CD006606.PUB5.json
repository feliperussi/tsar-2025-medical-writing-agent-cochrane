PCOS is a condition where women have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods and excess male hormone levels.\n\n- IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage - the loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy.\n- However, it reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) - a condition where the ovaries become swollen and painful after fertility medication.\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers to the question of whether IVM is better or worse than IVF for women with PCOS due to a lack of high-quality studies.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of IVM compared to IVF.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why is it a problem?\nPCOS is a health condition that affects 8% to 13% of women of reproductive age. It is a leading cause of infertility - the inability to get pregnant after one year of trying. Women with PCOS often have trouble getting pregnant due to irregular ovulation and may need assisted reproductive technology such as IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to conceive.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for PCOS-related infertility and what are their limitations?\nCommon treatments for PCOS-related infertility include IVF and ICSI. However, these treatments can have limitations. For example, women with PCOS may experience an exaggerated response to the hormones used to stimulate ovulation, which can lead to OHSS. This can be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication. Additionally, IVF and ICSI can be expensive and may not always be successful.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if IVM is effective in helping women with PCOS get pregnant. IVM involves retrieving immature eggs from the ovaries and maturing them in a laboratory before fertilization. The authors compared the benefits and harms of IVM followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. They looked at outcomes such as live birth, miscarriage, and OHSS to determine if IVM is a viable treatment option for women with PCOS-related infertility.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 subfertile women with PCOS undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The studies were conducted to compare IVM followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias in all domains and in terms of all outcomes, while the other two were at high risk of bias. IVM may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy but probably increases miscarriage and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to conventional IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, narrow participant populations, and incomplete coverage of the relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes under a GnRH-antagonist protocol, leading to imprecision and indirectness.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- In women with PCOS trying to get pregnant, it is unclear if IVM is as effective as IVF for achieving live birth.\n- IVM may increase the risk of miscarriage but reduces the risk of OHSS.\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers to the question of whether IVM is better or worse than IVF for women with PCOS due to a lack of high-quality studies.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of IVM compared to IVF.",
