  "text": "Are antibiotics before surgery to remove pregnancy tissue (uterine evacuation) helpful in preventing infection after the procedure?\n\n- We looked at whether giving antibiotics before surgery to remove pregnancy tissue can help prevent infection. The evidence is not strong, and we are not sure if it works.\n- Antibiotics given before surgery may reduce the risk of infection in the uterus, especially in studies with low risk of bias. However, the quality of the evidence is affected by poor follow-up and high non-compliance with antibiotic use.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies that assess the benefits and potential harms of antibiotics in uterine evacuation procedures.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and how is it managed?\nEarly pregnancy loss (when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks) can be a difficult experience for women. It is usually managed by removing any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus through a surgical procedure called uterine evacuation. Antibiotics are clearly needed for women with signs of infection, but it is less clear if they are needed for those without infection signs.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if routine antibiotic use before uterine evacuation can reduce the risk of infection and other complications. We also wanted to know if antibiotics can reduce the need for more antibiotic treatment and if they cause any unwanted effects like vomiting, diarrhea, or allergy.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women undergoing uterine evacuation. Most studies compared antibiotics with a placebo or no treatment. The evidence suggests that antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection, but this is not certain. Antibiotics may not affect the risk of vomiting or diarrhea and may increase the risk of allergy, but again, this is uncertain. They may also reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization for infection, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies were small, and participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies also involved different populations and methods, which can make it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to October 2023.",
