This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these residuals to the infant or discard them.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is effective and safe compared to discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also sought to understand the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals on other important outcomes, including the time it takes for infants to regain their birth weight, the time it takes to establish full tube feeding, and the number of days infants require total parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition).\n**Methods**\n## Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals.\n**Results**\n## Explanation\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed for processing. This limit is in place to prevent endless loops and ensure the system remains responsive.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by the lack of blinding, which introduces potential observer and participant bias, and by the small sample size, which reduces statistical power and limits the generalizability of the findings.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
