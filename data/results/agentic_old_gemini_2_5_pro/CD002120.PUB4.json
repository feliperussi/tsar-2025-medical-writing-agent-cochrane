However, it probably increases the risk of unwanted effects like irregular bleeding, headaches, and feeling sick.\n- Taking the birth control pill all the time (without a break) may work better for pain than taking it the standard way (with a break).\n- We are not sure if the birth control pill works better than common painkillers like ibuprofen, which are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We need more research to know the long-term benefits and harms of using the pill for period pain.\n\nWhat are painful periods?\nPainful periods are a common problem. The medical term is primary dysmenorrhoea, which means cramps that are not caused by any other health issue. Doctors often use the combined birth control pill (often just called 'the pill') to help manage this pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if the combined birth control pill helps with painful periods and if it causes any harm.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared combined birth control pills with a placebo, other pills, or NSAIDs for treating period pain. We then compared and summarized the results and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies with 3723 women who have painful periods. The studies compared combined birth control pills (OCPs) with a placebo or NSAIDs. Some studies also compared different types, doses, or ways of taking the pills. 11 studies compared OCPs with a placebo, 8 compared different OCP doses, 1 compared two ways of taking OCPs with a placebo, and 1 compared OCPs with NSAIDs. The studies did not report how long they lasted, who paid for them, or where they took place.\n\nMain results\nBirth control pills (OCPs) compared to a placebo (a dummy pill)\n\nPain\n- OCPs reduce pain. For every 100 women, if 28 see their pain get better with a placebo, we would expect between 37 and 60 to see their pain get better with OCPs.\n- Women taking OCPs may also need less extra pain medicine and may miss less work.\n\nUnwanted effects\n- OCPs probably increase the risk of unwanted effects.\n- OCPs cause a large increase in irregular bleeding. For every 100 women, if 18 have irregular bleeding with a placebo, we would expect between 39 and 60 to have it with OCPs.\n- OCPs probably increase the risk of headaches and feeling sick (nausea).\n- OCPs may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- We do not know if OCPs affect weight gain.\n\nComparing different ways of taking OCPs\n- Taking OCPs all the time (without a break) may reduce pain more than taking them the standard way (with a break).\n- Taking the pills the standard way probably increases the risk of irregular bleeding slightly compared to taking them all the time.\n- We do not know if the risk of serious unwanted effects, headaches, or feeling sick is different between the two ways of taking the pills.\n- We found probably little to no difference in pain relief between lower- and higher-dose OCPs, or between newer and older types of pills.\n\nOCPs compared to NSAIDs\n- We do not know if OCPs work better or worse than NSAIDs for period pain because we did not find enough evidence. The one study we found did not report on unwanted effects.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate for some results and low for others. This is because many studies were very small. We did not find enough evidence to be certain about some results, like how birth control pills compare to other pain medicines. Also, the studies did not report on the long-term effects of using these pills.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is current to March 2023.",
