The evidence does not clearly show if this teaching reduces asthma flare-ups (when symptoms get worse) that require an emergency department visit or a course of steroid tablets (medicines to reduce swelling in the airways).\n- More-intensive home teaching programs (for example, with more or longer sessions) may reduce hospital admissions for asthma when compared with less-intensive programs.\n- The studies used very different teaching programs, so we cannot be sure which parts are most important. Future studies should aim to find out what type of teaching is most effective for children and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and how can teaching help?\nAsthma is a long-term (chronic) illness of the lungs. It affects the airways (the tubes that carry air), making it hard to breathe. Asthma is common in children and they can manage it with medicines. Teaching is a key part of managing asthma. This means teaching children and their families about asthma, how to use their medicines correctly (like inhalers), and how to avoid 'triggers' (things that can make their asthma worse, like dust or smoke). This teaching can happen in different places, but this review looks at teaching given in the child's home. The home setting may help families who find it hard to travel to clinics. It also lets educators see the child's home environment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if teaching children about asthma at home helps them and their families manage the condition better. We compared home-based teaching with usual care (the care people normally receive) or with teaching in other places, like a hospital or clinic. We wanted to know if home-based teaching could reduce serious asthma attacks (flare-ups) that required an emergency department visit or a course of steroid tablets.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma teaching for children with usual care or with less-intensive teaching programs. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that included 5122 children and young people aged 1 to 18 years. Their asthma ranged from mild to severe. The studies looked at teaching programs given at home. They compared these programs with usual care, a waiting list, or less-intensive teaching. Researchers checked the main results after 6 months, but also looked at other time points.\n\nWe looked at the effects of teaching children with asthma at home.\n\n**Home-based teaching compared to usual care or teaching in other places**\n\nCompared to usual care, home-based teaching may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks requiring steroid tablets. It may improve quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), but we are very uncertain about this result. We do not know if home-based teaching affects asthma attacks that lead to an emergency department visit, symptom-free days, days missed from school, or hospital stays.\n\n**More-intensive home-based teaching compared to less-intensive home-based teaching**\n\nWhen we compared a more-intensive home-based teaching program with a less-intensive one, the more-intensive program may reduce hospital admissions for asthma. However, the more-intensive program may make little to no difference to asthma attacks leading to an emergency department visit, asthma attacks requiring steroid tablets, or days missed from school. It may not affect quality of life or symptom-free days, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies included different types of people and used different teaching methods. Also, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have affected the results (a potential source of bias). Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
