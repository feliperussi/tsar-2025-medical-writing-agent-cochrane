There are 5 trials happening now that may help answer this question in the future.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility?\n\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition with hormones that can make it hard for women to get pregnant. For women with PCOS who need help to get pregnant, one option is assisted reproductive technology (ways to help create an embryo), such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Standard IVF treatment uses high doses of hormone drugs to encourage the ovaries to produce and collect many mature eggs. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to a painful and possibly serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nAnother way is in vitro maturation (IVM). In IVM, doctors collect eggs from the ovaries when they are not yet mature and mature them in a lab. This method uses fewer hormone drugs, which may lower the risk of OHSS.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using IVM versus standard IVF for women with PCOS. We were especially interested in which way was better for a live birth (a baby born showing any signs of life). We also wanted to know which had a lower risk of miscarriage and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared IVM with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We combined the results of these studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence, looking at things like how the studies were done and how many women took part.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nOur review included 4 studies with a total of 810 women with PCOS who had a reduced ability to become pregnant naturally (subfertile). The studies compared IVM with standard IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which is a way to help fertilisation by putting a single sperm directly into an egg.\n\nWhen comparing IVM to standard IVF for women with PCOS, we found:\n- IVM greatly lowers the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. If the risk of OHSS after IVF is about 4 in 100 women, the risk with IVM would be between 0 and 2 in 100 women.\n- IVM increases the chance of miscarriage. If the chance of miscarriage after standard IVF is 20 in 100 women, the chance with IVM would be between 20 and 40 in 100 women.\n- IVM probably makes little to no difference to the chance of preterm birth (when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy).\n- IVM may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies (defects present at birth).\n- We are very unsure about the effect of IVM on live birth rates and clinical pregnancy rates (a pregnancy is confirmed when a fetal heartbeat is seen on an ultrasound).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not sure about the evidence. This is because the studies gave the treatment in different ways, and there were not enough studies to be sure about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
