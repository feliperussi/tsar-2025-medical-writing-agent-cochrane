  "text": "Infliximab for keeping Crohn's disease in remission\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with Crohn's disease, infliximab likely works better than a placebo (a dummy treatment) to keep the disease in remission (a period with few or no symptoms). We are not sure about the risk of side effects because there was not enough good evidence. Future studies should compare infliximab directly with other treatments to give clearer information on long-term benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and what is infliximab?\n\nCrohn's disease is a long-term illness that causes swelling in the digestive system. This can cause symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. People with Crohn's often have flare-ups (when symptoms get worse) and periods of remission (when symptoms are under control). High levels of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are thought to cause this swelling. Infliximab is a biologic medicine (a drug made from living cells) that blocks what TNF-α does. This helps to lower the swelling and control symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nAfter the first treatment controls Crohn's disease symptoms, more treatment is often needed to keep the disease in remission and stop symptoms from returning. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works and how safe it is for keeping Crohn's disease in remission.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe looked for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We then compared and summarized the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 9 studies with 1257 people in total. The studies included people whose disease showed up in different ways. Some people's disease was in clinical remission (all signs of the disease had gone), while others had a problem called fistulating disease (where abnormal tunnels form between the gut and other parts of the body). 7 studies included people who had not had biologic treatments before. The studies compared infliximab with: a placebo, purine analogues (medicines that quiet the immune system), a biosimilar (a near-identical copy of the original drug), and adalimumab (another biologic medicine).\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nInfliximab probably lowers the chance of the disease returning (a clinical relapse) compared to a placebo. For every 100 people taking a placebo, 75 had a relapse. This compares to 56 out of 100 people taking infliximab. Adding infliximab to a purine analogue probably greatly reduces clinical relapse compared to taking the purine analogue by itself. For every 100 people taking only a purine analogue, 59 had a relapse. This compares to just 12 out of 100 people who also took infliximab. Infliximab may make little to no difference to clinical relapse compared to a biosimilar. For side effects and when compared to other treatments, the evidence was very unclear. This means we do not know if infliximab affects the risk of side effects compared with a placebo, purine analogues, or other biologic medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence for many results. This is because there were not enough studies to be sure about the findings, and the studies did not always give information about everything we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review is an update of a past review. The evidence is current to June 2023.",
