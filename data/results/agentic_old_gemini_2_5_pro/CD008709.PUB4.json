  "text": "Single-incision sling surgery for women who leak urine: benefits and harms?\n\nKey messages\n- Single-incision sling surgery likely works as well to improve urine leakage after 1 year as other types of sling surgery.\n- Compared to another type of sling surgery (transobturator slings), single-incision slings probably cause less long-term pain. However, they may slightly lower a woman's quality of life (her overall well-being).\n- We are not sure about the long-term results and unwanted effects. We need more research to know how safe and effective this surgery is.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it treated?\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks when pressure is put on the bladder, such as when you cough, sneeze, or exercise. This common condition can greatly affect women's lives.\n\nOne treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation. A doctor does this surgery by placing a small piece of man-made tape (mesh) inside the body. The tape holds up the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra). This helps stop leaks. But, some countries limit the use of this mesh in women's surgery because of safety worries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision slings work and how safe they are for women with stress urinary incontinence. We compared them with other treatments, like other types of sling surgery. We checked if the slings improved incontinence or caused unwanted effects. These included pain, problems with the mesh (like it showing in the vagina or wearing through body tissues), and if more surgery was needed. We also looked at how much these surgeries cost.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision sling surgery with other ways to treat women's urine leakage. We then compared and summarized the findings. We also rated how sure we were of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence. The studies followed the women for 12 to 24 months or longer. We compared single-incision slings with other treatments. We found no studies that compared these slings to having no treatment, non-surgical care, or other types of surgery like colposuspension or keyhole surgery.\n\nMain results\n\nSingle-incision sling versus a sling made from the body's own tissue\n- We do not know if single-incision slings change the risk of painful sex or mesh problems compared to slings made from a woman's own body tissue. The studies did not say if incontinence was cured or got better.\n\nSingle-incision sling versus a retropubic sling (a synthetic sling placed behind the pubic bone)\n- Single-incision slings may make little to no difference in curing or improving incontinence after 1 year compared to retropubic slings. We are not sure if they change the risk of mesh problems, trouble emptying the bladder after surgery, or needing another operation.\n\nSingle-incision sling versus a transobturator sling (a synthetic sling passed through the groin)\n- Single-incision slings make little to no difference in curing or improving incontinence after 1 year, or in the number of mesh problems, compared to transobturator slings.\n- Single-incision slings probably lead to less long-term pain (after 2 years). They also likely reduce the number of women who have trouble emptying their bladder after surgery.\n- But, women with these slings may have a slightly lower quality of life after 1 year. We are not sure if they change the risk of painful sex or needing another operation.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence for some findings. People in the studies may have known which treatment they got. This could have skewed the results. Some studies were small or did not report on all the things we were interested in. They also sometimes included different types of people. This makes it hard to be sure about the results, especially in the long term.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe updated a previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",
