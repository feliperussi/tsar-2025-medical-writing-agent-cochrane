Wearing masks in the community may make little or no difference in the number of people who get sick with a respiratory illness. Washing hands may slightly lower the number of people who get sick.\n- For healthcare workers, using special N95/P2 masks (masks designed to filter very small particles) probably makes little or no difference in stopping infection compared to standard medical masks.\n- We have low confidence in these results. This is because of how the studies were done and because people often did not use masks or wash hands correctly. We need larger, better studies to understand the effects of these actions, especially during pandemics (a disease outbreak that spreads across many countries).\n\nWhat are acute respiratory infections and how can we stop them from spreading?\nAcute respiratory infections are illnesses of the nose, throat, and lungs caused by viruses. They can spread quickly from person to person. Sometimes they cause widespread outbreaks, like the flu or COVID-19. Vaccines (shots that help your body fight a virus) and antiviral drugs can help, but they may not be enough to stop viruses from spreading. Because of this, people are often told to use 'physical methods'. These are actions that do not involve medicine, like washing hands, wearing face masks, and staying away from others, to stop viruses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well these physical methods work to stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested if physical methods, like wearing masks and washing hands, could lower the spread of viruses. We looked for studies where people were randomly put into different groups to compare the effects (these are called randomised controlled trials). We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur updated review includes a total of 78 studies. 11 new studies were added during this update, which included over 610,000 new people. The studies took place in different settings around the world, from schools and hospitals to crowded inner-city areas.\n\n- Masks: In the general public, wearing a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference in whether people get an illness with flu-like or COVID-19-like symptoms. It also likely makes little difference to the number of cases proven by a lab test. For healthcare workers, using an N95/P2 respirator (a special mask that fits tightly and filters small particles) instead of a medical mask probably makes little to no difference to their risk of getting the flu.\n\n- Hand washing: Washing hands probably slightly lowers the number of people who get a respiratory illness. For example, if 380 out of 1000 people would normally get sick, washing hands would likely lower this to about 327 people. However, for illnesses with flu-like symptoms or flu proven by a lab test, washing hands may make little to no difference.\n\n- Harms: The possible harms of these physical methods were not well-studied, so it is unclear what they might be.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. We have concerns about how the studies were done. The studies also included different types of people and measured the results in different ways. Finally, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results for some health outcomes (a specific result that can be measured, like the number of people who get sick).\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
