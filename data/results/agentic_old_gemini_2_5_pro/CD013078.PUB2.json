This is because we lack good-quality evidence that compares them with no treatment, glucocorticoid (steroid) injections, or surgery (operating to repair a part of the body).\n- The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects (adverse events).\n- We need higher-quality studies to know the real benefits and harms of strengthening exercises for this condition. This research should include people who are not athletes so the findings can apply more widely.\n\nWhat is jumper's knee?\nJumper's knee (patellar tendinopathy) is a common condition that causes pain at the front of the knee. The main way to treat it is with different types of exercise, like strengthening and stretching. Other treatments that are sometimes used include glucocorticoid (steroid) injections and surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using exercise to treat people with jumper's knee.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. These are studies where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared strengthening exercises with no treatment (where people receive no extra treatment) or other treatments like injections or surgery. We then compared and summarized the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 trials with a total of 211 people who had long-term (chronic) jumper's knee. All the people in the trials were athletes. Their average age was 26 years, and 88% were male. Their symptoms had lasted for an average of 41.6 months.\n\nThe studies compared strengthening exercises with:\n- no treatment\n- glucocorticoid injection\n- surgery\n- stretching exercise\n- pulsed ultrasound (which uses sound waves in short bursts to treat injuries) and transverse friction (a type of deep tissue massage)\n\nWe did not find any trials that compared strengthening exercises with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or a sham treatment (a 'pretend' treatment).\n\nFor athletes with long-term pain at the front of the knee, it is unclear how strengthening exercises compare with other treatments. These findings apply only to athletes, not the general public. No studies reported on unwanted effects of treatment.\n\nStrengthening exercise versus no treatment\nWe do not know if strengthening exercise affects pain. It may make little to no difference to knee function.\n\nStrengthening exercise versus glucocorticoid (steroid) injection\nStrengthening exercise may make little to no difference to pain or knee function when we compare it to a glucocorticoid injection.\n\nStrengthening exercise versus surgery\nWe do not know if strengthening exercise affects pain or knee function when we compare it to surgery. It may make little to no difference in whether the treatment succeeds or how many people return to sport.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge can affect how they behave or report their symptoms, which can create errors in the results (performance bias). Finally, the evidence focused only on athletes, so the results may not apply to the general public.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
