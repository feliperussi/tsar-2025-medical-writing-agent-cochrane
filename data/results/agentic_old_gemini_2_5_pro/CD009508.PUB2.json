Doing these exercises more days per week may also be more helpful.\n- It probably makes little difference if a health professional supervises the exercises one-on-one or in a group. Side effects were rare and were mostly minor discomfort from training devices used inside the body.\n- We are not certain about some findings because many studies were small. We need larger, better-designed studies to find the best ways to do these exercises.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and how can pelvic floor muscle training help?\nUrinary incontinence is when urine leaks out by accident. This is a common problem for women. It can happen when coughing or sneezing (stress incontinence). It can also happen with a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency incontinence), or a mix of both. One treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). These are exercises to make the muscles that support the bladder stronger. But there are many ways to do these exercises. The training can differ by the type of exercise, how much exercise is done (the dose), and how the training is given (for example, in a clinic or at home).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the best way to do pelvic floor muscle training for women who leak urine. We looked at how different exercise types, doses (how often they are done), and delivery methods (like in a group or one-to-one) affected women.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised trials. In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance. The studies compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training for women who leak urine. We combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 trials with 4920 women who leaked urine. Most women were aged 45 to 65 years. We compared different ways of doing the training to see which worked best to improve women's enjoyment of life.\n\nType of exercise\n- Training that mixes body movements with pelvic floor muscle exercises may slightly improve enjoyment of life more than standard exercises.\n- Standard pelvic floor exercises may improve enjoyment of life more than general exercises.\n- Adding general exercises to a pelvic floor routine may make little to no difference.\n\nDose of exercise\n- Doing pelvic floor exercises more often each week may greatly improve enjoyment of life.\n- Training without a resistance device may slightly improve enjoyment of life. However, we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nHow training is delivered\n- It probably makes little difference to enjoyment of life if training is supervised one-on-one or in a group.\n- Getting instructions from an app (e-health) may slightly improve enjoyment of life compared to written instructions.\n- Training in a clinic may slightly improve enjoyment of life more than training at home. However, we are very uncertain about this result.\n- Clinic-based training may have little to no effect on enjoyment of life compared to training using an app. However, we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. There were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results. Many studies were very small. They also used different ways to deliver the training. Also, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have affected the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
