We are unsure if treatments like betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, or corticosteroids improve vertigo (a spinning sensation), and little information was collected on their potential unwanted effects.\n- To better understand these treatments, future studies need to be larger and better designed. It is important that researchers agree on the best ways to measure the symptoms of Ménière's disease, so that the results of different studies can be compared and combined.\n\nWhat is Ménière's disease and how is it treated?\nMénière's disease is a condition of the inner ear. It causes recurring, sudden attacks of vertigo (a spinning sensation or dizziness), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears). The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown. A number of different medicines that are taken by mouth are used to try and prevent these attacks, including betahistine, diuretics ('water pills'), antiviral medications and corticosteroids. However, it is not clear how effective these treatments are at preventing the attacks and their associated symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of these medicines for people with Ménière's disease. We compared the effects of the medicines against a placebo (a dummy treatment that contains no active medicine) or no treatment at all.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment for people with Ménière's disease. We then summarized the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 10 studies with a total of 848 adults diagnosed with definite or probable Ménière's disease. The studies evaluated drug treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids, comparing them against either a placebo or no treatment. No studies on antihistamines were found. The follow-up period for the included studies was at least 3 months, with outcomes reported at various time points ranging from 3 months to over 1 year.\n\nIt is very uncertain whether medicines taken by mouth (including betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids) have any effect on the symptoms of Ménière’s disease, such as vertigo. The available studies did not provide enough clear information to know if these treatments are helpful or harmful. Therefore, we do not know if these medicines improve vertigo or have an effect on other symptoms of Ménière's disease.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. The studies that have been done were very small, used different ways to measure the effects of the treatments, and did not all provide data (information collected from people in the study) about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
