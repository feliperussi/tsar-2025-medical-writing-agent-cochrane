The supplements may help to prevent bouts of diarrhea and slightly improve growth, but they may also cause vomiting (being sick). It is still unclear if zinc supplements can prevent deaths from specific illnesses like chest infections (such as pneumonia) or malaria. Future studies should focus on children in regions where not getting enough zinc is common.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency?\nZinc is a nutrient that is essential for staying healthy. When children do not get enough zinc from their food, it is called zinc deficiency. This is a common problem in many low- and middle-income countries. Zinc deficiency can be serious. It can increase a child's risk (chance) of illness and death, and it can also slow down their growth. This means they do not grow as tall as they should. Giving children zinc supplements (adding nutrients to the diet), such as in a syrup, is one way to prevent these problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years helps to keep them healthy. We looked at whether zinc supplements could prevent deaths, reduce how often children get sick, and help them grow taller.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving zinc supplements with no supplement or a dummy supplement (a placebo). The children in the studies were aged 6 months to 12 years. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand the effects on death, illness, and growth.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 96 studies with a total of 219,584 children. These studies were a type of study called a randomized controlled trial, where participants are randomly assigned to different groups to test a specific treatment. The studies took place in 34 countries, mostly in low- or middle-income countries. Most children in the studies were under 5 years old. Children who were in the hospital or had long-lasting (chronic) diseases were not included. The studies compared giving zinc supplements to prevent illness with giving a dummy treatment (a placebo) or no treatment. The zinc was usually given as a syrup at a dose of 10 mg to 15 mg daily. The studies followed the children for a median (middle value) of 26 weeks.\n\nOur review found that for children aged 6 months to 12 years, giving zinc supplements to prevent illness:\n- makes little to no difference to the number of deaths from any cause.\n- probably makes little to no difference to deaths from diarrhea.\n- probably reduces deaths from lung infections and malaria, but the evidence is not certain. It is possible that supplements could even increase the risk.\n- probably slightly reduces bouts of diarrhea.\n- probably slightly increases height.\n- makes little to no difference to illness from lung infections.\n- increases bouts of vomiting (being sick).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate (medium). For some results, there were not enough studies or cases of the events we were interested in to be certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
