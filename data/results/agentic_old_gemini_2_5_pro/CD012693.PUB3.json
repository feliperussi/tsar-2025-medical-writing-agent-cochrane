More research is needed.\n\nWhat is IVF and why is the hormone dose important?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a fertility treatment where women receive daily hormone injections to encourage their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The number of eggs collected is important, but getting the hormone dose right can be difficult. Too high a dose can lead to a serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), where the ovaries swell and become painful. Too low a dose may result in too few eggs, and the treatment cycle may be cancelled. To help choose the best dose for each woman, doctors can use 'ovarian reserve tests'. These tests, which include blood tests and ultrasound scans, help to predict how a woman's ovaries will respond to the hormone treatment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ovarian reserve tests to choose an individual hormone dose for women undergoing IVF improves their chances of having a baby and reduces their risk of developing severe OHSS, when compared with using a standard dose.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving women different doses of a fertility drug based on tests of their egg supply (ovarian reserve). We combined and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that included a total of 8520 women. These women were undergoing IVF or ICSI (a procedure where a single sperm is injected into an egg). The studies compared different doses of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a hormone that helps eggs grow. Women were grouped as likely low, normal, or high responders based on tests of their egg supply. Some studies compared a personalized dosing plan against giving everyone the same dose.\n\nMain results\nUsing tests of how a woman's ovaries might respond to stimulation (ovarian reserve tests) to guide the hormone dose for IVF may slightly increase the chance of having a baby. It may also reduce the risk of a complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- If the chance of a live birth with a standard hormone dose is 25 in 100, using these tests to guide the dose would result in between 25 and 31 live births for every 100 women.\n- If the chance of developing moderate or severe OHSS with a standard dose is 5 in 100, using the tests to guide the dose would result in between 2 and 5 women developing this complication.\n\nFor women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, it is unclear if adjusting the dose (giving more to low responders or less to high responders) affects the chance of having a baby or the risk of OHSS.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for several reasons:\n- People in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could influence the results.\n- There were not enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n- The studies used different methods to personalize the hormone dose.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
