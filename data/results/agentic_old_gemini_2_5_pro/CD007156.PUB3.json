They may also reduce the burning feeling in the mouth.\n- For most other treatments, the benefits and harms are unclear because of a lack of good-quality evidence. We are uncertain about the unwanted or harmful effects of any treatment. Some people taking antioxidants reported mild and temporary stomach problems.\n- We need larger, better-quality studies to compare different treatments. These studies should measure effects that matter to people, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWHAT IS ORAL SUBMUCOUS FIBROSIS?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to become stiff, making it hard to open the mouth fully. This can be painful and affect a person's quality of life (how they feel and function day to day). It can make it hard to eat, chew, and swallow. People with OSF also have a higher chance of developing mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing the areca nut (a seed from a type of palm tree). A key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWHAT DID WE WANT TO FIND OUT?\nWe wanted to find out how well different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis work and if they have any unwanted effects.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for this condition. The treatments were compared against each other, a placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medicine), or no treatment. We then compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe found 30 studies with a total of 2176 adults. All participants had oral submucous fibrosis that was confirmed with a biopsy (where a small tissue sample is taken for examination).\n\nThe studies looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines like antioxidants, steroids, and others, as well as physical therapy and surgery.\n\nOur findings focused on antioxidants.\n- Burning feeling: Antioxidants probably reduce the burning feeling in the mouth.\n- Mouth opening: Antioxidants may slightly increase how wide the mouth can open when measured at less than 3 months, and probably increase it slightly when measured between 3 and 6 months. They may make little to no difference when measured at 6 months or more.\n- Unwanted effects: There was not enough information to be certain about unwanted effects. A few studies reported mild stomach problems that did not last long.\n\nFor all other treatments we looked at, we do not know if they affect mouth opening or a burning feeling. No studies measured whether people could eat, chew, and speak normally again.\n\nWHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Most studies were not well designed. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Many studies were also very small. Because of these issues, we cannot be certain about the results for most of the treatments.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThis is an update of a previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
