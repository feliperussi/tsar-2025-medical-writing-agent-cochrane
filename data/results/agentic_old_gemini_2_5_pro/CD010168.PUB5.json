The evidence suggests that using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital and probably increases the risk (chance) of death.\n- The studies we found were not large or well-designed enough to provide a clear answer. We need larger, better studies to understand the true effects of using drains after this type of surgery, especially about the risk of death.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why is drainage used?\nAppendicitis is when the appendix (a small organ attached to the large intestine) becomes inflamed. Doctors usually treat it by surgically removing the appendix (an appendectomy). Sometimes, appendicitis is 'complicated'. This means the appendix is severely inflamed, has started to decay (become gangrenous), or has burst (perforated). People with complicated appendicitis have a higher risk of developing infections inside their belly (abdomen) after surgery. One type of infection is an abscess (a collection of pus). To try and stop (prevent) this, surgeons sometimes place a small tube (an abdominal drain) into the belly to drain away any fluid. However, it is not clear if using a drain is helpful or harmful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We wanted to know if using a drain reduces the risk of an abscess forming inside the belly. We also wanted to compare the effects of different types of drains and find out the best time to remove a drain.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using a surgical drain versus no drain after an operation for complicated appendicitis. We also looked for studies that compared different types of drains or different timings for drain removal. We then combined the results from the studies and used a system called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 739 people, including children and adults. All had complicated appendicitis, where the appendix had started to decay or had burst. The main comparison was using a drain in the belly versus no drain after surgery. The effects of the treatment (outcomes) were measured at 30 days.\n\nMain results\nFor people having surgery for a complicated appendix, we do not know if using a drain affects the risk of developing an abscess in the belly, a wound infection, or overall harmful effects (complications). The evidence is very uncertain. However, using a drain after surgery probably causes a large increase in the risk of death within 30 days. In the studies, there were 7 deaths in the group with drains compared with 1 death in the group without drains. Using a drain may also increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this result. We found no studies that compared different types of drains or different timings for when to remove a drain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Our confidence is low because the studies were very small, which can lead to inexact results (imprecision). Also, it is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which can introduce flaws (bias) in the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
