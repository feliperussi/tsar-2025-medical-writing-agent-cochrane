  "text": "What is the best way to feed adults after surgery to remove the head of the pancreas (a Whipple procedure)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults getting better after surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, it may be better to feed them through a tube into their gut than through a drip into a vein.\n- One type of tube feeding, using a tube put into the small intestine through the belly during surgery (jejunostomy), likely cuts the time people spend in the hospital. We are not sure if this method changes the risk of unwanted effects.\n- Overall, we do not have enough good evidence to be certain about the best way to feed people after this major surgery. We need more studies that look at all the different feeding options to find out which is safest and works best.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure and why is feeding important after?\nA Whipple procedure is a major surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, an organ that helps you digest food. Doctors do this surgery most often to treat cancer. The surgery makes big changes to the digestive system (the organs that take in and break down food). This can make it hard for patients to eat normally and get the food they need to get better. This can lead to poor nutrition (malnutrition), which raises the risk of problems after surgery. To stop this, doctors feed patients in different ways after surgery. These include a normal diet (eating and drinking), tube feeding (enteral nutrition), and feeding through a drip in a vein (parenteral nutrition).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to look at the evidence from studies to find the best way to feed adults who are getting better after this surgery. We wanted to see how different feeding methods affected how well people recovered and their chance of having problems.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that randomly put people into different treatment groups to compare treatments. These studies looked at different ways to feed adults after surgery on their pancreas. We then put together the results from the studies and rated how certain the evidence made us.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies with 1897 adults who had this surgery. The studies looked at different ways to feed people after their surgery. They focused on how and when people were fed, not on the type of food.\n\nMain results\nAfter surgery, people can be fed in different ways:\n- through a tube put in the gut during the surgery (jejunostomy)\n- through a tube passed through the nose into the gut (nasojejunal tube)\n- through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition)\n- by eating and drinking normally (oral diet)\n\nTube feeding into the gut versus feeding into a vein\nCompared to feeding into a vein, feeding through a tube in the gut probably cuts the time people stay in the hospital. This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of a pancreatic fluid leak after surgery. We are very unsure if it affects the risk of the stomach emptying too slowly or heavy bleeding after the surgery.\n\nTube feeding through the nose versus feeding into a vein\nCompared to feeding into a vein, feeding through a tube in the nose may make little to no difference to hospital stay, the risk of the stomach emptying too slowly, or the risk of bleeding. But, feeding into a vein may slightly lower the risk of a pancreatic fluid leak. We are very unsure if this type of feeding affects the risk of other major or minor problems.\n\nTube feeding into the gut versus eating and drinking normally\nWhen we compared tube feeding into the gut to eating and drinking normally, there may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or the risk of problems, but we are very unsure about these results.\n\nAcross all groups, we are very unsure if the type of feeding after surgery affects the risk of death.\n\nHow good is the evidence?\nWe are not sure about the evidence because the studies were small and fed people in different ways. This means we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
