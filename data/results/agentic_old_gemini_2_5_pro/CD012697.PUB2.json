  "text": "Magnetic seizure therapy for schizophrenia\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia. Our findings are based on only 1 small study that compared it with electroconvulsive therapy (a treatment that uses electric currents to cause a seizure).\n- The single study suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer memory problems than electroconvulsive therapy. However, because of the study's limitations, this finding is very uncertain.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to properly understand the potential benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy are new treatments for schizophrenia needed?\nSchizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that can be disabling. The main treatment is antipsychotic medicines (medicines used to relieve the symptoms of psychosis), but these do not work for everyone. For this reason, researchers are looking for other treatment options. One of these is magnetic seizure therapy (MST), a newer treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well magnetic seizure therapy (MST) works to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia, and whether it has any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) with other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review is based on 1 study with 79 adults experiencing acute (sudden and short-term) schizophrenia. The study lasted for 4 weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care.\n\nBecause there is only 1 small study, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of MST compared with ECT for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWe do not know if MST improves the symptoms of schizophrenia or if it affects the number of people who leave treatment early when compared to ECT. It is also unclear if MST has an effect on cognitive problems (problems with thinking and memory).\n\nTherefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of MST for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is based on only 1 small study. There was also a high risk of bias (flaws in the study design that can lead to incorrect conclusions), as it is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
