  "text": "For people with cystic fibrosis, is it better to use samples from a lung camera (bronchoscopy) to guide how doctors treat lung infections, compared to standard ways like a throat swab?\n\nKey messages\n- For infants and children with cystic fibrosis, we found no good evidence that using samples from a lung camera (bronchoscopy) to guide how doctors treat lung infections with antibiotics is better than standard care (using throat swabs and symptoms). This method may lead to more hospital stays and can cause short-term unwanted effects, like a worse cough.\n- What we found is based on 2 studies in children, so we have no evidence for using this method in adults with cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why are lung infections a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs. This mucus can trap germs, which leads to frequent lung infections. To manage CF, it is key to treat these infections quickly and well. To choose the right antibiotic, doctors need to find out which germs are causing the infection. They usually do this by testing a sample of sputum (phlegm coughed up from the lungs). However, some people, especially young children, cannot produce sputum. In these cases, doctors often use samples from a throat swab, but they worry these swabs may not find the germs deep inside the lungs.\n\nHow do doctors use a bronchoscopy to guide treatment?\nDoctors can get samples directly from the lungs with a procedure called a bronchoscopy. During a bronchoscopy, a doctor passes a thin, flexible tube into the lungs. They can then collect a sample, often by washing a small area of the lung with a sterile fluid and collecting it (a procedure called a bronchoalveolar lavage, or BAL). The idea is that if doctors use these more accurate samples to choose an antibiotic, they could treat people better and improve their health. However, this procedure is more invasive than a simple throat swab.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a bronchoscopy to guide how doctors treat lung infections with antibiotics in adults and children with cystic fibrosis is better than standard care, where doctors use other methods like throat swabs and symptoms.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment against using standard ways (like throat or cough swabs) in people with cystic fibrosis. We put together the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 2 studies with 187 infants and children with cystic fibrosis in total. The studies compared guiding antibiotic treatment with a bronchoscopy against standard treatment that used throat swabs and symptoms.\n\nWe found no evidence to support routinely using a bronchoscopy to guide how doctors treat lung infections with antibiotics in preschool children with cystic fibrosis when compared to standard care.\n\nCompared with standard treatment, using a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment probably makes little to no difference to chest scores from CT scans (which take detailed pictures of areas inside the body) or to the overall cost of care. It may also make little to no difference to how well the lungs work (lung function), nutrition, quality of life (a person's overall enjoyment of life), or how often doctors find certain bacteria. However, it may lead to more hospital stays each year. The procedure had some unwanted effects; the most common was a cough that got worse for a short time. In a few cases, a person's condition got much worse.\n\nWe found no evidence for adults.\n\nWhat limits the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it comes from only 2 studies, and 1 was very small. The studies also measured the effects of the treatments in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their results. The evidence does not apply to adults because the studies only included children.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous one. The evidence is up to date to November 2023.",
