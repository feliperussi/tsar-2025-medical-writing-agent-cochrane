A life-threatening illness is a disease that cannot be cured. Anxiety involves feelings of fear and dread, and depression is a condition of ongoing sadness.\n- The therapy had some unwanted effects, but they were not serious. These effects did not last long and included higher blood pressure, feeling sick to the stomach (nausea), and anxiety.\n- However, we are not sure about these results. The studies were small, and the people in them may have known if they got the real drug or a fake one (a placebo). We need bigger and better studies to be sure about the benefits and harms.\n\nHow does a life-threatening illness affect mental health?\nWhen people find out they have a life-threatening illness like cancer, they can face big emotional challenges. They may feel very worried (anxiety), sad (depression), or hopeless about the meaning of life (existential distress).\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nResearchers are exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy to help with these feelings. In this therapy, a person takes a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin or LSD) in a safe setting with trained therapists. Psilocybin comes from 'magic mushrooms'. LSD is another powerful drug that can cause hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real). Researchers think this therapy might ease anxiety and depression. But these drugs are illegal in most countries and have possible harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to look at the research to understand the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for people with life-threatening illnesses. We compared it to a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other therapies to see if it could lower anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared this therapy with a placebo in people with life-threatening illnesses. We then put together the results from the studies and checked how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening illnesses. The studies tested therapy using either psilocybin and LSD, or MDMA (also known as Ecstasy). They compared these drugs to a placebo that had noticeable side effects or to a low dose of the same drug.\n\nFor people with life-threatening illnesses, therapy with psilocybin or LSD may reduce anxiety and depression. We are not sure if it helps with feelings of hopelessness. For therapy with MDMA, we are not sure if it helps with anxiety or depression.\n\nPeople seemed to handle the therapies well. The studies reported no serious unwanted effects. A serious unwanted effect is a harmful event that is life-threatening or requires a hospital stay. Common unwanted effects were mild and did not last long. They included higher blood pressure, feeling sick to the stomach (nausea), and anxiety.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies were very small. Also, the people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This can create bias (flaws in a study that lead to wrong results). Bias can happen when people are not 'blinded' (kept unaware of which treatment they got).\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",
