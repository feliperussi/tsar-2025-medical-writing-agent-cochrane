This is because there is not enough good-quality evidence. Bladder problems can include a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is when germs (bacteria) grow in the urinary system.\n- The studies we looked at were of poor quality and did not follow people for long enough. We need more and better research to find the best time to take out a urinary catheter after a kidney transplant.\n\nWhy are urinary catheters used after a kidney transplant?\nA kidney transplant is the best treatment for people with severe kidney disease, a condition where the kidneys stop working properly. After the transplant surgery (operation), doctors put a thin tube called a urinary catheter into the bladder (the organ that stores urine) to drain it. This helps the new surgical connection between the kidney and the bladder to heal. However, a catheter can also create a path for germs (bacteria) to enter the bladder, which can lead to a UTI. The longer the catheter stays in, the greater the chance (risk) of infection. Right now, doctors do not agree on the best time to remove the catheter after a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if the time when the catheter is removed after a kidney transplant changes the results for patients. We compared taking the catheter out 'early' (less than 5 days after surgery) with taking it out 'late' (5 days or more after surgery). We wanted to know if the timing made a difference to the number of people who got:\n- urinary tract infections with symptoms (signs of a condition);\n- bacteria in the urine without symptoms (called asymptomatic bacteriuria); and\n- other serious problems with the urinary system (urological complications) that needed treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared taking urinary catheters out from kidney transplant patients early (before 5 days) versus late (at or after 5 days). We put the results from the studies together and checked how sure we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review had 2 studies with a total of 197 people who had a kidney transplant. The studies compared taking the urinary catheter out early with taking it out later. The studies followed people for a short time; no one was followed for more than 1 month. We are not sure if taking a catheter out early versus later changes the chance of getting bacteria in the urine without symptoms. The review also found little information on other important results, like urinary tract infections with symptoms and serious medical problems (complications).\n\nWeaknesses of the evidence\nWe are not sure about the evidence. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and they did not give us information on all the results we wanted to know about.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to April 2023.",
