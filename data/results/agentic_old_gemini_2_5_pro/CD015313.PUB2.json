However, the evidence is not reliable. The study did not report on unwanted effects.\n- We need more and better studies to find out if these medicines are helpful and safe.\n\nWhat is a long-term wet cough in children?\n\nSome children have long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough. These include conditions like bronchiectasis, where the airways in the lungs widen permanently, and other long-lasting bacterial infections. In these conditions, the airways can become damaged and inflamed (swollen and red). This causes thick mucus to build up, which leads to a persistent wet cough. When mucus builds up, it can cause repeated infections (when germs grow in the body). This creates a cycle of infection and inflammation that is hard to break. Mucolytics are medicines that aim to thin the mucus, making it easier for children to cough it up and clear it from their lungs.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with these long-term lung conditions. We looked for studies that compared mucolytics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. We wanted to know if mucolytics could reduce flare-ups (when symptoms get worse), improve children's quality of life (how they feel and function day to day), and improve their lung function. We also wanted to know if the medicines caused any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared using mucolytics with a placebo or no treatment in children with a long-term wet cough. We found 1 study. We summarized its results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nOur review is based on 1 small study of 52 children (average age 9 years). The children had bronchiectasis not caused by cystic fibrosis (a disease passed down through families that causes thick mucus). The study compared inhaling salty water before chest physiotherapy (physical techniques to loosen mucus) with using physiotherapy alone for 8 weeks.\n\nThe study found that inhaling salty water may reduce how often children have flare-ups and may improve their lung function. However, we are very uncertain about these results because the study was small and had limitations. The study did not report on quality of life or unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. It comes from only 1 small study. In that study, the people involved may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. The study also did not provide all the information we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2024.",
