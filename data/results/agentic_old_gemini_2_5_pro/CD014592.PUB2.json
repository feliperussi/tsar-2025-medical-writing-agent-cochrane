This is because we did not find enough evidence, and no studies looked at oestrogen therapy by itself.\n- When used with other treatments, oestrogen put on the vagina may have some good effects. It may lead to fewer vaginal problems in women using pessaries (devices placed in the vagina to support the pelvic organs) and fewer urinary infections after surgery for prolapse.\n- We need larger studies to find out the effects of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse, both when used by itself and with other treatments.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that affects women after menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop). It happens when the pelvic floor muscles get weak and can no longer hold up the pelvic organs. This causes one or more organs like the womb, bladder, or bowel to slip down and bulge into the vagina.\n\nHow might oestrogen help?\nOestrogen is a hormone that goes down after menopause. Researchers think that treatment with oestrogen might help make prolapse symptoms better. It can be a cream put on the vagina (local oestrogen) or a pill or patch that affects the whole body (systemic oestrogen). It can be used alone or with other treatments like surgery or vaginal pessaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the good and bad effects of using oestrogen therapy to treat pelvic organ prolapse in women who have gone through menopause. We wanted to know if oestrogen, used by itself or with other treatments, helps improve symptoms and if it causes any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared oestrogen therapy (alone or with other treatments) against no treatment, a placebo (a dummy treatment), or other treatments. The studies included women with pelvic organ prolapse who had gone through menopause. We compared and put together their results and judged how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies with a total of 1002 women. However, we found no studies that looked at oestrogen therapy by itself. The studies only looked at oestrogen therapy used with other treatments. 3 studies compared oestrogen with vaginal pessaries versus pessaries alone. 11 studies compared oestrogen with surgery versus surgery alone. Because no studies looked at oestrogen therapy on its own, we do not know its effect on prolapse symptoms. When oestrogen was used with other treatments, we were very uncertain about the results. It might lead to fewer vaginal problems for women using pessaries and fewer urinary infections after surgery, but we are not confident in this evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very certain about the evidence. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. This can create bias (a flaw in the study that can lead to wrong results). Also, not all studies gave us information on the things we were interested in. The studies were also small and used different ways of giving the treatment. For these reasons, we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review includes evidence found up to June 2022.",
