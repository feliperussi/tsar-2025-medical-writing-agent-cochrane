We are unsure if it stops kidney disease from getting worse. The study suggested this treatment caused little or no difference in serious unwanted effects.\n- For adults and children who have protein in their urine (a sign of kidney damage), we are unsure if medicines called ACE inhibitors help. The studies did not report unwanted effects well.\n- We found no studies that used red blood cell transfusions to treat kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n- We need more and better-designed studies, especially in older children and adults.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and how does it affect the kidneys?\nSickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. It can cause severe pain and damage organs. The kidneys are often affected. Over time, this damage can lead to chronic kidney disease, a condition where the kidneys do not work properly. One of the first signs of kidney damage is when a protein called albumin leaks into the urine. If this gets worse, it can progress to serious kidney failure. This sometimes requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different treatments prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We looked at treatments like hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors (medicines often used to treat high blood pressure), and red blood cell transfusions.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). We looked for studies that tested treatments for kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with a total of 385 people with sickle cell disease.\n- One study involved 193 children aged 9 to 18 months. It compared hydroxyurea to a placebo (a dummy treatment). We are unsure if hydroxyurea affects overall kidney function, but it may help the kidneys to concentrate urine. It may cause little or no difference in the number of serious problems related to sickle cell disease, such as severe chest problems, pain, or hospital stays.\n- Two studies looked at ACE inhibitors. One study included 22 adults, and the other included 170 children. For both adults and children with early signs of kidney problems, we are unsure if an ACE inhibitor helps to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n- We found no studies that looked at red blood cell transfusions.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies were very small and did not include all the people or treatments we were interested in. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Finally, the studies did not provide data about everything we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The search date is not stated in the abstract.",
