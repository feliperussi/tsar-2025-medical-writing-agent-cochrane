There was not enough good-quality evidence to be certain about its effects on symptoms or blood flow.\n- We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the effects of physical exercise for this condition. Future research should compare different types of exercise programmes to find out which are most effective.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition (a medical problem) where the veins in the legs have trouble sending blood back up to the heart. This can cause symptoms like pain, swelling, and feelings of heaviness in the legs. These symptoms can lower a person's quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). If the condition gets worse, it can lead to open sores on the skin, known as venous leg ulcers (a deep open sore or break in the skin). Physical exercise has been suggested as a possible treatment (action or therapy) to help reduce the symptoms of CVI.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if physical exercise programmes are helpful for people with chronic venous insufficiency that has not yet developed into ulcers. We looked for studies that compared exercise programmes with no exercise to understand the benefits and any possible harms.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared physical exercise programmes with no exercise for people with chronic venous insufficiency. We summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies with a total of 146 people with chronic venous insufficiency that had not caused skin sores. The studies compared different physical exercise programs to a control group (people in a study who do not receive the study treatment).\n\nDue to a lack of strong evidence, we do not know if physical exercise programmes affect:\n- signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency\n- quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day)\n- muscle strength\n- ankle movement\n\nNo studies looked at whether exercise prevents leg ulcers. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence for two main reasons. First, the studies had a very small sample size (number of participants). Second, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. This can create bias (flaws in a study that can lead to unfair results).\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
