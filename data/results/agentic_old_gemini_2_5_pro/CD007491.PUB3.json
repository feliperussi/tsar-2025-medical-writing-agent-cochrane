We found little information on unwanted effects of treatment.\n- More research is needed to understand how 'hospital at home' services affect caregivers (family members or friends who help care for the person who is unwell).\n\nWhat is 'hospital at home'?\nSometimes, people have an illness that would normally mean they need to go into hospital. Another option is 'hospital at home'. This is when healthcare workers, like doctors and nurses, actively treat a person in their own home for a limited time. This care is for people who are sick enough to otherwise need a hospital bed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare 'hospital at home' with the usual care people get in a hospital. We wanted to find out how 'hospital at home' affects people's health and how satisfied they were with their care. We also looked at the costs of the 2 types of care.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared 'hospital at home' services with usual hospital care. We combined the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 20 randomized controlled trials with a total of 3100 people. The studies included adults, mainly older people, with different medical problems. These included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe, also called COPD), stroke (a condition caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain), or other acute (sudden and short-term) medical issues. The studies followed people for 3 to 12 months.\n\nThe studies compared 'hospital at home' care that helps people avoid a hospital stay with the usual care people get in a hospital.\n\nFor certain older people who need to go to the hospital, being treated at home instead probably makes little to no difference to their health. This includes their risk of dying or their chances of being readmitted to the hospital.\n\nHowever, being treated at home probably reduces their chance of needing to move into a care home. It also probably reduces costs to the health service and may make people more satisfied with their care.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are only moderately confident in the evidence. This is because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, some studies did not report on everything we were interested in. The studies included different types of people, and the 'hospital at home' service was different across the studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
