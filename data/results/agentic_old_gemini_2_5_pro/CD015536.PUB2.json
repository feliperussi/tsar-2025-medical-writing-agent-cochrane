We need better and larger studies to properly understand how it affects outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life, death, and serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B and how do we treat it?\nChronic hepatitis B is a long-term liver infection that a virus causes. It is a major health concern worldwide. We treat it with antiviral medicines (drugs used to treat infections caused by viruses). Many official guidelines recommend one such medicine, entecavir, as a main, or 'first-line', treatment. However, these guidelines did not rely on a review that directly compared entecavir against no treatment or a placebo.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of entecavir for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B when we compared it to no treatment or a placebo.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared entecavir against either no treatment or a placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. These studies were randomised clinical trials (research studies where people are put into treatment groups by chance). We then combined the findings from the studies and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 22 studies that involved 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. Most studies included only adults; 1 study focused on children and another included a mix of ages. The studies compared entecavir taken by mouth (orally) against either no treatment or a placebo. People in the studies were followed for 5 to 228 weeks.\n\nWhen we compared it with no treatment or a placebo, we do not know if entecavir changes the chance of death or serious unwanted effects. This is because no one died in the studies, and the evidence for serious unwanted effects is very uncertain. We found no evidence showing how entecavir affects people's quality of life (how they feel and function day to day).\n\nWhat limited the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could mean the way the studies were designed was flawed (this is called bias). Also, very few of the events we were interested in happened, which makes the evidence less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
