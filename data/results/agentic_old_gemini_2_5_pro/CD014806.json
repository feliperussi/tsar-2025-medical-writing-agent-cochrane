The review found only minor unwanted effects that did not need treatment.\n- Giving sugar solution appears to relieve pain about as well as giving a different sugar solution (glucose), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin contact (holding a baby against a parent's bare chest).\n- It is uncertain how giving sugar solution compares with other comfort measures, such as breastfeeding or using a pacifier, because there is not enough good-quality evidence. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of giving sugar solution to babies for pain.\n\nIntroduction\nWhy is it important to manage pain in newborn babies?\nNewborn babies sometimes have minor but painful procedures, such as a heel prick to get a blood sample for testing. Researchers have looked at simple ways to reduce this pain. One method is to give the baby a small amount of sugar water (sucrose) by mouth. This is thought to have calming and pain-relieving effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well giving sugar water works for relieving pain from heel pricks in newborn babies. We looked at both immediate and long-term effects.\n\nMethods\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving sugar water to newborn babies for pain relief from heel pricks against other treatments or no treatment. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 55 studies with a total of 6273 newborn babies. Some studies included babies born on time (term neonates), some included babies born early (preterm neonates, born before 37 weeks), and some included both.\n\nThe studies compared giving sugar water for pain relief with other methods, including:\n- no treatment or a placebo (a treatment that looks the same but has no active ingredient, like plain water);\n- non-nutritive sucking (letting a baby suck on something that doesn't provide food, like a pacifier);\n- a different sugar solution (glucose);\n- breastfeeding or expressed breast milk;\n- music;\n- laser acupuncture (using a low-level laser beam instead of a needle on the body's pressure points);\n- facilitated tucking (gently holding a baby's arms and legs close to their body); and\n- skin-to-skin care (holding a baby against a parent's bare chest).\n\nMain results\nFor newborn babies having a painful heel prick, giving a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably reduces their pain compared to giving plain water or no treatment.\n\nGiving sugar water may make little to no difference to pain scores when compared to giving a glucose solution, expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin contact.\n\nWe do not know if sugar water affects pain when compared to other comfort measures such as using a pacifier, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking. We also do not know if combining sugar water with a pacifier is any better than using a pacifier alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies included different groups of babies and used different ways of giving the treatments. There were also not enough studies to be certain about the results for all of our questions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\nAn editor meticulously refines a draft, incorporating feedback and adhering to strict style guidelines.
