These problems include infections at the surgery site and leaks where the bowel is rejoined. This is compared to using the physical clean-out alone. We found very few details about the unwanted effects of this method.\n- We are not sure if combining the methods is better or worse than using oral medicines alone, or having no bowel cleaning at all. This is because we did not find enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more research to learn about the effects of using oral medicines alone or having no bowel cleaning. Future studies should also report on the possible unwanted effects of these methods.\n\nWhy is cleaning the bowel before surgery important?\nPeople who have planned bowel surgery can have problems after the operation. The large bowel has many bacteria in it. These bacteria can cause infections in the surgery wound or leaks where surgeons re-join the bowel. To lower this chance, doctors may clean out the bowel before surgery.\n\nOne way is a physical clean-out using strong laxatives to empty the bowel. The other way is to take oral medicines to lower the number of bacteria. Doctors can use these methods alone or together. We are not sure which way is best to prevent problems after surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining a physical bowel clean-out with oral medicines is better than other options for preventing problems after planned bowel surgery. The other options were a physical clean-out alone, oral medicines alone, or no cleaning.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared combining a physical bowel clean-out and oral medicines before planned bowel surgery. The studies compared this combined method against a physical clean-out alone, oral medicines alone, or no cleaning. We compared and combined the results of the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults. They were having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous problems. The studies compared the combined method against 3 other options: a physical clean-out alone (17 studies), oral medicines alone (3 studies), or no cleaning (1 study). The exact ways the bowel was cleaned were not the same across the studies. Only 4 studies reported on unwanted effects. No studies recorded specific harmful effects like the body losing too much water (dehydration) or having imbalanced body salts (electrolytes).\n\nMain results\n\nCombined method versus physical bowel clean-out alone\nCompared with a physical clean-out alone, the combined method:\n- probably greatly reduces infections at the surgery site.\n- probably greatly reduces leakage from where the bowel was rejoined.\n- probably makes little to no difference in how long people stay in the hospital or their chance of death.\n- may make little to no difference in the bowel slowing down after surgery (a condition called ileus).\n\nCombined method versus oral medicines alone\nWe do not know if using the combined method is different from using oral medicines alone to prevent problems like infections or leakage. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nCombined method versus no cleaning\nWe are also not sure if the combined method is better than no bowel cleaning at all for preventing problems after surgery.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have medium confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different methods for the treatments. Also, not all studies gave us details about everything we were interested in, like unwanted effects. For some of the treatments, we did not find enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to December 2021.",
