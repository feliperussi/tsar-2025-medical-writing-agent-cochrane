However, it may cause more unwanted effects like hot flushes (a sudden feeling of intense warmth).\n- It is uncertain how GnRHas compare to other hormonal medicines for pain relief.\n- Treatment with GnRHas may decrease bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength). Taking other medicines alongside GnRHas may help reduce this bone loss.\n- We are not confident in the evidence, so the results are uncertain. We need better studies to understand the true benefits and harms of GnRHas for endometriosis pain.\n\nWhat is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the ovaries. This can cause pelvic pain (pain in the lower part of your tummy), painful periods, pain during sex, and difficulty getting pregnant.\n\nHow can endometriosis be treated?\nOne treatment to reduce pain is a type of medication called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). These are a type of hormone therapy. However, these drugs can have unwanted effects, including a loss of bone strength.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well GnRHas work and how safe they are for treating pain from endometriosis. We were interested in their effects on pain, bone strength, and a person's quality of life (their overall enjoyment of life).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are randomly put into different treatment groups to compare them. We looked for studies that compared GnRHas with a placebo, no treatment, or other treatments for women with endometriosis. We then compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 72 studies that included 7355 women with endometriosis. The studies compared GnRHas with a placebo, another medicine called danazol (a synthetic hormone), or GnRHas combined with other medicines to help protect the bones.\n\nCompared to a placebo, GnRHas may reduce overall pain. However, they may also cause more hot flushes. We are uncertain if there is any difference in pain relief when comparing GnRHas to danazol.\n\nTaking GnRHas alone may lead to a slight decrease in bone density. Taking them with medicines that help regulate calcium (a mineral needed for healthy bones) may reduce this effect, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Many studies were very small and did not provide data on all the outcomes we were interested in. Therefore, all these results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022.",
