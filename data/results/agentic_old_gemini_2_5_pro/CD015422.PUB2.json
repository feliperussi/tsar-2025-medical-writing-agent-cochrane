This is particularly true in places where people already use other methods to prevent malaria, like insecticide-treated bed nets.\n- Any unwanted effects from the repellents were rare and minor, such as mild skin reactions.\n- Repellents might help protect people from malaria in high-risk groups (people with a higher chance of getting the disease), such as refugees, who may not be able to use other prevention methods.\n\nWhy look for new ways to prevent malaria?\nMalaria is a serious disease that mosquito bites spread. The main ways to prevent it are by using insecticide-treated bed nets (bed nets treated with insecticide to kill mosquitoes) and by spraying the inside walls of homes with insecticide (indoor residual spraying). However, these methods mainly protect people when they are indoors at night. They do not stop mosquito bites that happen outdoors or at other times. Repellents are creams or sprays that people apply to the surface of their body (topical) to keep mosquitoes away. They could further protect people who may not be protected by nets or indoor spraying, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work or travel in forests.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents helps to prevent people from getting malaria. We looked at how well the repellents worked when people used them alone or with other ways to prevent malaria, like bed nets.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at whether people who used topical repellents had fewer cases of malaria. We then combined the findings from these studies and rated how confident we were in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 8 studies with a total of 61,651 people. The studies focused on high-risk groups as well as people living in regions where malaria is constantly present (endemic). The review examined how people used topical repellents, either alone or combined with other methods to prevent malaria.\n\nWhen we looked at new malaria infections and people with malaria symptoms together, we found that topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of cases. They may also slightly reduce the number of people who have malaria at a specific time (the prevalence). This seemed to benefit high-risk groups the most, like refugees, who may not be able to use other prevention methods. In places where people already use other tools like bed nets, there is not enough evidence to say that topical repellents protect people further. Using topical repellents is safe, and very few people had mild skin reactions.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because of flaws in how some studies were designed, which could lead to unfair results (bias). For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided all the information (data) we were interested in.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
