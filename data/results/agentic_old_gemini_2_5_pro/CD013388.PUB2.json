These benefits can last for several months after the therapy ends. The studies reported no harm.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- The main findings are based on good evidence, but they come mostly from 1 large study. We need more research to be sure of these results and to find ways for the therapy to help more with daily life and well-being.\n\nBACKGROUND\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for people with dementia?\nDementia (a condition where a person loses the ability to think, remember, or make decisions) causes problems with memory, thinking, and focus. These problems can make it harder for people with dementia to manage daily tasks and live on their own. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personal therapy that aims to help. A therapist works with the person with dementia to find practical ways to handle the daily tasks they find hardest. The goal is to help people with mild-to-moderate dementia keep their skills and stay independent for as long as possible.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild-to-moderate dementia manage their everyday activities. We also wanted to understand its effects on other parts of their lives, and on their care partners.\n\nSTUDY METHODS\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care or no treatment. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nSTUDY RESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe reviewed 6 studies where people were randomly assigned to different treatments (randomised controlled trials). In total, 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia took part. Most had Alzheimer's disease (a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills). Their average (mean) age was 76 to 80 years, and the number of men in the studies varied from 29.4% to 79.3%. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation to usual care or no treatment. Researchers checked on the people at the end of the treatment and again 3 to 12 months later.\n\nMain results\nFor people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive rehabilitation greatly helps them manage the daily activities they want to improve. This large benefit lasts for at least several months after the treatment ends.\n\nThe therapy also slightly boosts a person's confidence in their own abilities (self-efficacy) and their memory right after treatment. It probably slightly improves a person's ability to focus on specific sounds (auditory selective attention) and may slightly improve their ability to pay attention over time (sustained attention). However, it probably also slightly lowers their ability to function in general some months after treatment. For many other outcomes for the person with dementia, like quality of life (how they feel and function day to day), the therapy probably or may make little to no difference.\n\nFor care partners, cognitive rehabilitation slightly improves the social parts of their quality of life several months after treatment. It also probably slightly improves the psychological parts of their quality of life. For other outcomes for care partners, such as their physical health and stress levels, the therapy probably or may make little to no difference.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We have worries about how the studies were done. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they got. This is a research issue called a lack of 'blinding'. Also, there are not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results.\n\nCURRENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
