It looks at many different countries, types of healthcare workers, and ways of joining services. Because of this variety, we could not provide a single summary of healthcare workers' views.\n- People who do research can use this review as a map to guide future work. The next step is to carry out reviews that group similar studies together (a process known as qualitative evidence syntheses) to better understand how different situations affect what healthcare workers go through.\n\nBackground\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare is usually the first contact people have with the health system. In many places, services for different health problems are separate. For example, services for mental health, HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), or care for mothers (maternal care) and children are often in different programs. 'Primary healthcare integration' brings these separate services together. The goal is to make healthcare more efficient and easier for people to use, especially where resources are limited. Healthcare workers are key to making this work. Their views help us understand what is working well and what is not.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that a lot of research already existed about what healthcare workers go through with integrated care. However, this research was very varied. It covered different countries, types of healthcare workers, and health services. We wanted to create a map of all this existing qualitative research (research based on people's experiences and views). Our goal was to describe the types of studies that have been done and find any gaps in the research. This map can help guide future studies.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about what healthcare workers think of combining different primary healthcare services. We then summarized and mapped the details of these studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 countries. These included high-, middle-, and low-income countries (countries grouped by their average national income). The studies looked at the views and experiences of many types of healthcare workers. This ranged from people who make health policies to clinicians and community health workers. The studies covered combining different health services, like mental health, HIV, care for mothers and children, and services for long-term conditions.\n\nOur main finding is that the research in this area is very varied. The studies were different in terms of the countries, the health services being combined, the healthcare workers involved, and the research methods used. This review provides a map of this research to help guide future studies. It does not give conclusions about the effects of combining services.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies included different types of people and used different ways of delivering the new approach (the intervention). The evidence also did not cover all the people or types of approaches we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched for studies up to July 2020.",
