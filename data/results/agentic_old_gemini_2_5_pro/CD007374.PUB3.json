This is measured with a blood test called glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) that shows average blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months. These programmes may also improve people's knowledge about their condition. It is unclear if they affect other important health outcomes like kidney failure or death. We did not find information about unwanted effects.\n- We based these conclusions on only a few small studies. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to better understand the long-term benefits and potential harms of education programmes for this group of people.\n\nWhy are education programmes important for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\nPeople who have both long-term kidney damage (chronic kidney disease, or CKD) and diabetes often have complex treatment plans to follow. These plans can include changes to diet, multiple medicines, and checking blood sugar levels. Because these plans are complicated, people can find it difficult to stick to them. Education programmes aim to help by providing information, advice, and support to help people manage their health conditions better. However, it is not clear how effective or safe these programmes are.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of education programmes for adults with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes when compared with usual care.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared education programs with routine care for adults with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We then put together their results and rated how certain we were of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 840 adults who had both chronic kidney disease and diabetes. These studies compared education programmes with routine care. We found that education programmes probably reduce blood sugar levels (measured as HbA1c) slightly. The programmes may also reduce total cholesterol and 'bad' (LDL) cholesterol.\nPeople who take part in these programmes may improve their knowledge about diabetes, their belief that their treatment is effective, and their confidence in managing their condition. The programmes may help people to change how they manage their diet and monitor their blood sugar immediately after the programme, but these changes may not last over time.\nIt is unclear if education programmes affect the chance of death, serious low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), or kidney failure because the evidence is very uncertain.\nWhen education was combined with team-based care from different health professionals, it may make little to no difference to blood sugar levels, kidney failure, blood pressure, or cholesterol compared to routine care.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not very confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
