Future studies need to see if these treatments help people live longer and to look at newer drugs.\n\nWhat is ongoing treatment for this cancer?\nCLL is a blood cancer that mainly affects adults. First treatments can cause the cancer to go into remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone), but it often comes back or gets worse. After a person's first treatment works well, a doctor might offer 'maintenance therapy'. This is treatment that continues to keep the cancer under control. The alternative is for a doctor to observe the person's health and only treat them if things change. We are not sure about the benefits and harms of these ongoing treatments.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to learn about the benefits and harms of ongoing treatment for people with CLL. We looked at studies that compared different drugs with observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that randomly put people into different treatment groups. These studies compared ongoing treatment with a placebo or observation. We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with 2393 people with CLL. The middle age of the people was between 54 and 72 years, and about 60% were men. The cancer was at a different stage (how advanced it is) for different people. 5 studies included people with early-stage cancer who had signs of illness, and 3 included people with advanced-stage cancer. The studies compared different ongoing treatments against observation or a placebo. 7 studies looked at anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab), which are lab-made proteins. 3 studies looked at the drug lenalidomide, which affects the immune system. 1 study looked at the drug alemtuzumab. We found no studies on newer drugs like B-cell receptor inhibitors or B-cell leukaemia-2/lymphoma-2 inhibitors.\n\nAnti-CD20 drugs (such as rituximab or ofatumumab)\nCompared to observation, this type of ongoing treatment:\n- probably increases the time before the disease gets worse.\n- probably does not change how long people live.\n- may increase serious unwanted side effects and all unwanted side effects.\n- may not change a person's quality of life (their general well-being).\n\nLenalidomide therapy\nCompared to a placebo or observation, this type of ongoing treatment:\n- probably greatly increases the time before the disease gets worse.\n- probably does not change how long people live.\n- may increase serious unwanted side effects.\n- probably slightly increases all unwanted side effects.\n- We are not sure if it affects if people stop treatment.\n\nAlemtuzumab therapy\nWe found very little information about this treatment. We are not sure if it increases the time before the disease gets worse. We found no information about its other effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies included different types of people and used different treatments. Also, some studies were very small and did not give us data on all the results we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",
