The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects (side effects).\n- We need more and better studies that follow children for longer to find out if these medicines are helpful and safe. Future research should include babies born early and children with neurodisabilities (long-term conditions caused by a problem with the brain or nervous system).\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is when the contents of the stomach travel back up the food pipe (the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach, also known as the oesophagus). In babies, this is very common and is often called spitting up or regurgitation (the effortless spitting up of stomach contents). For most babies, GOR is a normal process that they grow out of. However, when the reflux causes troublesome symptoms (signs of sickness), such as pain, feeding problems, or poor growth, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD may be treated with medicines to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work for treating GOR and GORD in infants and children up to 16 years old.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines for reflux in children and infants against each other or a placebo (a dummy or sugar pill treatment). We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies with a total of 2251 infants and children up to 16 years old. The studies compared various pharmacological treatments (treatments using drugs or medications). These included strong medicines that reduce stomach acid called proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole) and another class of acid-reducing medicines called H2 antagonists (such as ranitidine). These were compared with a placebo or another medication.\nFor infants with reflux, it is unclear if medicines like omeprazole or esomeprazole have an effect on symptoms compared to a placebo. We also do not know if omeprazole has a different effect on symptoms compared to ranitidine.\nFor older children with reflux disease, using different doses of certain medicines (rabeprazole and pantoprazole) may lead to little or no difference in symptom improvement, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. The studies were very small and included different types of people. Also, not all of the studies provided the data we were interested in, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
