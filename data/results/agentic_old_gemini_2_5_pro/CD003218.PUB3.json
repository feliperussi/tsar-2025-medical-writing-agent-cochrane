  "text": "Are stimulant medicines helpful for excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with myotonic dystrophy, it is very uncertain if stimulant medicines (drugs that increase alertness) improve excessive daytime sleepiness when measured by tests of how long a person can stay awake.\n- People taking these medicines reported feeling less sleepy themselves, but they may also be more likely to experience unwanted effects.\n- The available evidence is only from short-term studies (up to 4 weeks), so longer and larger studies are needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of these medicines.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a long-term genetic condition that affects muscles and other parts of the body. A common and disabling symptom for people with myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness (also known as hypersomnia), which means feeling very sleepy during the day. To treat this sleepiness, doctors sometimes prescribe drugs called psychostimulants, which are intended to help people stay awake and alert.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective psychostimulants are for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We also wanted to know if these drugs cause any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychostimulants with a placebo (a dummy treatment) for adults with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness. We combined the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 6 studies with a total of 136 people. All participants were adults, aged 18 to 70, with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness. The studies were short-term, lasting up to 4 weeks, and compared psychostimulants against a placebo. No studies looked at the long-term effects of these treatments.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, it is very uncertain if psychostimulants have an effect on sleepiness when measured by objective tests, or on quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). Psychostimulants may improve sleepiness when people rate their own symptoms, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. The studies included were very small, and their results were inconsistent. This makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the treatment's true effects.\n\nEvidence currency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
