The studies did not report any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- We need more high-quality studies to understand the potential benefits of these support programs for both adults and children in different situations.\n\nWhy is mental health support important in humanitarian crises?\n\nWars, conflicts, and other disasters force millions of people to leave their homes. Most of these people live in low- and middle-income countries (countries with developing economies). People in these crises face many stressors (events or situations that cause stress) that can harm their mental health (a person's overall emotional and psychological condition) and well-being.\n\nPsychological (related to the mind and feelings) and social support may help. These are non-medical activities, often in groups, that aim to improve positive parts of mental health, like a person's well-being, ability to cope, and quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). This review focused on these supportive interventions (actions taken to improve health), not on treatments for specific mental illnesses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if these support programs help improve the mental health of adults and children in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We compared these programs to situations where people received no support, the usual available support, or were on a waiting list.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological and social support with no support for people in these settings. We combined the results of the studies to understand the effects on mental health and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 13 studies with 7917 people. 9 studies focused on children and adolescents, and 4 focused on adults. The studies took place in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania.\n\nFor children and adolescents, this support may make little to no difference to their helpful and co-operative behaviour or their mental well-being. It may slightly improve their daily functioning, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nFor adults, this support may slightly improve mental well-being in the short term. However, it may have little to no effect in the medium term, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWe found no studies that looked at daily functioning or helpful behaviour in adults.\n\nOverall, there is not enough information to be sure about the benefits of these programs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. Our confidence was also limited because it was possible for people in the studies to know which support they were getting, which can create bias (a flaw in study design that can lead to incorrect conclusions). Also, the studies included different types of people and used different support methods, making the results hard to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
