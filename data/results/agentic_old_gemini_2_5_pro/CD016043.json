  "text": "Title: What are the different ways to provide eye tests and glasses in local communities?\n\nKey messages\n- We found several ways to provide eye tests and glasses for vision problems (refractive errors) in local communities. These ways include services based in schools, pharmacies, local health clinics, or mobile outreach programmes. However, we found very little information about the benefits or harms of these different approaches.\n- More research is needed to find out how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help guide decisions on how best to strengthen eye care services in local communities.\n\nPlain language summary\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nA refractive error is a common eye condition that causes blurred vision because the eye cannot focus light correctly. It is a leading cause of vision problems worldwide. In most cases, glasses can easily correct this. However, many people do not have access to the basic eye care they need. The World Health Organization (WHO), a part of the United Nations that deals with major health issues around the world, has set a global goal to increase the number of people receiving treatment for refractive error. To help meet this goal, it is important to find ways that work well to provide eye tests and glasses in local settings, such as community health centers, schools, and mobile clinics, rather than just in hospitals.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find the different ways that eye care services, like vision tests and providing glasses, are delivered in community and primary care settings (health services that meet most basic health care needs). We also wanted to find out what methods have been used to evaluate these different approaches.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies and reports published in the last 20 years. These studies described different ways of providing eye care services in community and primary care settings (health services that meet most basic health care needs). We then summarized the different approaches we found.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 402 records describing different ways to provide eye tests and glasses in community and primary care settings. These included services in schools, pharmacies, outreach clinics, and health centres. School-based and outreach approaches were common in the WHO African region, while outreach was most common in the Americas. We highlighted that there is not enough research to know how well these different approaches work.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to November 2022.",
