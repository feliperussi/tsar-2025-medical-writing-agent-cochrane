  "text": "What are the benefits and harms of healthcare workers using their own mobile phones for work?\n\nKey messages\n- Using personal mobile phones can help healthcare workers be more adaptable and respond better to the needs of patients and colleagues. However, this informal practice has downsides. These include risks to patient privacy (protecting personal information), the chance of unfair care between patients, and extra costs for staff.\n- This informal phone use can weaken the healthcare system. It creates 'shadow' information systems, which are unofficial systems where important patient information is not recorded in official records. Future efforts should aim to keep the benefits of these informal solutions and lower their negative effects.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\nHealthcare workers sometimes use their personal mobile phones or other devices to help them do their jobs. This is often an informal solution, meaning it is not officially approved or managed by their workplace. This can help them talk to each other and find information, especially when the official systems at their workplace are not good enough. However, using personal devices for work can also create new problems for workers and their patients.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to explore the views, what people have gone through, and the practices of healthcare workers and managers who use their own mobile devices for work. We wanted to understand the reasons for this practice and its effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's views and experiences) about healthcare workers using their own mobile devices for work. We then combined the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies took place in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. They covered a range of healthcare settings and different types of healthcare workers. Most studies described the use of mobile phones rather than other mobile devices, such as tablets.\n\nWhen healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices for work, it probably increases their ability to be adaptable and responsive to patient needs. However, this informal practice also probably increases unfairness among healthcare workers, who have to pay the costs themselves. This approach may also create problems for patients. For example, it creates risks to the confidentiality of their information (protecting personal information from people who should not see it). It may also weaken the overall healthcare system.\n\nHow confident are we in our findings?\nWe are confident in the findings of this review. The findings are based on a group of studies from a range of different countries and healthcare settings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to August 2022.",
