For example, we do not know if it reduces deaths or the need for breathing support.\n- The medicine may increase the number of unwanted effects overall, but probably not serious ones.\n- The evidence we found is not strong enough to draw clear conclusions. We need better-designed studies to determine if favipiravir has a role in treating people with COVID-19.\n\nWhat is favipiravir?\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has presented a major challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. In the search for effective treatments, some experts suggested that an antiviral drug called favipiravir might be a safe and effective option. Although this drug has been tested in scientific studies, it is still not clear if it has a role in treating people with COVID-19.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of favipiravir for treating people with COVID-19. We compared it to no treatment, standard supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral drugs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. These are studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. The studies we looked for compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive care, or other antiviral drugs for people with COVID-19. We then compared and combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 trials with a total of 5750 adult participants. Most participants were under 60 years of age and were hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 (89%). The studies took place in 13 countries.\nMost trials compared favipiravir to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or standard care. 2 trials used a different drug (lopinavir/ritonavir) as a comparison, and 1 trial used another drug (umifenovir). The treatment with favipiravir lasted from 5 to 14 days.\nFor people with COVID-19, we do not know if favipiravir affects the number of people who died. We also don't know if it affects the number of people who needed a machine to help them breathe (invasive mechanical ventilation) or the time it takes for symptoms to get better.\nFor people treated outside the hospital, favipiravir may make little to no difference to their need for hospital admission. It may also make little to no difference to the number of people who needed oxygen therapy.\nFavipiravir may increase the number of unwanted effects. However, it may make little to no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects (harmful medical issues that result in death, are life-threatening, or require hospitalization).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",
