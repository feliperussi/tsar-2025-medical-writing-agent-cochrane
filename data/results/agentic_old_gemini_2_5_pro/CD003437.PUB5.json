However, medicines may cause unwanted effects on the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and stomach. Brain stimulation appeared to have little to no effect on depression. We need more and better-quality research to be sure about the benefits and harms of these treatments.\n\nWhy is depression a problem after a stroke?\nMany people feel depressed after a stroke (a loss of blood flow to the brain that damages brain tissue). This can make it harder for them to recover. Often, this depression is not noticed or treated well. Several treatments may help. These include medicines, talking therapies (like counselling), and brain stimulation. Brain stimulation uses magnetic fields or electrical currents on the head to affect parts of the brain. These treatments can be used alone or together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and any unwanted effects of these treatments for people with depression after a stroke. We looked at medicines, brain stimulation, and talking therapies, used alone and together.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for depression after a stroke. We combined the results from the studies. Then, we rated how sure we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with 5831 people who had depression after a stroke. The studies randomly put people into different groups. This was to compare a treatment against a dummy treatment to see if it worked.\n\nThe studies compared different treatments against:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n- sham stimulation (a fake treatment that feels real);\n- usual care (the care a provider would normally give); or\n- a control group that got the same amount of attention from researchers but not the therapy.\n\nFor people with depression after a stroke:\n- Medicines may help reduce the number of people with depression, but we are very unsure about this result. They may also cause more unwanted effects on the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the stomach, but we are very unsure about this.\n- Brain stimulation on its own may have little to no effect on the number of people with depression, but we are very unsure about this result.\n- Talking therapies may help reduce the number of people with depression, but we are very unsure about this result.\n- Adding brain stimulation to medicine may reduce the number of people with depression. However, this combination may not help people who still have depression feel better. We are very unsure about this result.\n\nWe did not find studies to tell us if combining medicine with talking therapies, or brain stimulation with talking therapies, worked well.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not sure about the evidence. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results. Also, the studies did not give us information about everything we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
