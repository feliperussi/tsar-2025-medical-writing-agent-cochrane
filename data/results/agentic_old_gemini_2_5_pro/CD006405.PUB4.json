However, this does not seem to mean more babies need a breathing machine.\n- High-flow treatment likely causes fewer nose injuries and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n\nWhat are breathing problems in premature babies?\nBabies born too early (preterm) often have lungs that are not fully developed. This can cause a breathing problem called respiratory distress syndrome. These babies may need support to help them breathe. One type of support is nasal high flow (nHF) therapy. It delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the baby's nostrils. This is 'non-invasive' because it does not use a breathing tube down the baby's throat. Other non-invasive supports are continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gives a steady flow of air to keep lungs open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives breaths at a set rate and pressure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if nasal high flow (nHF) is a safe and effective first breathing support for preterm babies compared to other supports like CPAP and NIPPV. We looked at benefits, like preventing death or lung disease, and harms, like the treatment failing or injuring the baby's nose.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared nHF therapy to other types of breathing support for preterm babies. We compared and summarized the results from these studies and rated how certain we were of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies with 2540 preterm babies who had breathing problems. The babies were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Very few babies in the studies were born extremely early (before 28 weeks). The studies compared nHF therapy to other non-invasive supports like CPAP or NIPPV.\n\nMain results\nWhen we compared nHF to CPAP, we found it may make little to no difference to the combined risk of death or developing a long-term lung condition. It also probably makes little to no difference in how many babies need a breathing tube.\n\nHowever, nHF is more likely to fail as a first treatment. For every 100 babies treated, the treatment fails for about 9 more babies who get nHF than for those who get CPAP.\n\nOn the other hand, nHF probably reduces the risk of nose injuries and a collapsed lung.\n\nWhen we compared nHF to NIPPV, we found it probably makes little to no difference for most major outcomes, like death or needing a breathing tube. It does, however, probably reduce the risk of nose injury. We are very uncertain how it affects the combined risk of death or a long-term lung condition.\n\nWe do not have enough information to make conclusions about using nHF for the most fragile babies, those born before 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWhat limits the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies delivered the treatment in different ways and did not include many very premature babies. Also, the hospital staff knew which treatment each baby received. This knowledge could have affected the results, creating a risk of bias (flaws in the study design). Finally, for some outcomes, we did not have enough studies to be certain of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis is an update of our previous review. The evidence is current to March 2022.",
