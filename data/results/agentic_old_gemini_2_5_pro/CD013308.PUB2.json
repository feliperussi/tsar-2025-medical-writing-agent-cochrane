For example, using a skin patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge is more effective.\n- Higher-dose NRT products may help more people quit than lower-dose ones. We found limited information on unwanted effects, but they were generally uncommon.\n- Starting NRT before a planned quit day may help more people to quit than starting it on the day itself. However, we need more research to be certain.\n- It is still unclear how long people should use NRT, or if 1 type of fast-acting NRT (like gum or lozenges) is better than another.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)?\nQuitting smoking is difficult because cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that gives people nicotine in a 'cleaner' form, without the other harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms (the unpleasant feelings people get when they stop smoking), making it easier to quit completely. NRT is available in different forms, such as patches, gum, lozenges, and sprays. While we know NRT helps people quit, it is not clear which ways of using it are most effective.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the best ways to use NRT to help people stop smoking for at least 6 months. We looked at the evidence to compare the effectiveness and safety of:\n- different forms of NRT (e.g. patches versus gum);\n- using a combination of NRT products versus a single product;\n- different doses of NRT (higher strength versus lower strength);\n- using NRT for different lengths of time;\n- different schedules for using NRT (e.g. starting it before the quit day versus on the quit day).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different forms, doses, and ways of using NRT for people trying to quit smoking. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies with 43,327 adults who wanted to quit smoking. The studies recruited most participants from the community or from healthcare clinics. All studies followed participants for at least 6 months.\n\nMain results\nUsing a combination of NRT, such as a patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge, increases the chances of quitting for good compared to using only 1 type of product.\nWhen using a single product, a fast-acting therapy like gum or a lozenge makes little to no difference to quit rates compared to using a nicotine patch.\nFor people using patches, a standard-dose patch probably increases the chances of quitting compared to a lower-dose patch. However, using an even higher-dose patch probably makes little to no difference compared to a standard-dose patch.\nStarting NRT before the planned quit day probably increases the chances of successfully quitting compared to starting on the quit day itself.\nIt is unclear if the length of time someone uses NRT affects their success in quitting. We also do not know if 1 type of fast-acting therapy is better than another.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because in some studies, people may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, for some questions, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
