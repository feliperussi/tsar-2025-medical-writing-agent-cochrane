  "text": "Can personal programs help lower job stress for healthcare workers?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs for individuals may help lower job stress for healthcare workers. This was true for programs that help people focus on their stress, and for programs that help them focus away from it (like relaxation or exercise).\n- These effects may last for up to 1 year. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects from these programs.\n- We do not know the long-term effects of these programs. We are also not sure how well programs that change job-related factors work. Future studies need better design to give us more certain results.\n\nWhy is job stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nWorking in healthcare can be stressful. When job demands are high and support is low, healthcare workers can suffer from job stress. This can lead to burnout (a state of complete mental, physical, and emotional exhaustion from long-term job stress), anxiety, and physical health problems. It can also affect the quality of care they give to patients. This review looked at programs made to help single healthcare workers manage their stress.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well different programs to lower stress work for healthcare workers. We compared these programs to no program or to other types of support to see if they helped lower signs of stress.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested different kinds of support to lower stress for healthcare workers. We combined their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 117 studies with 11,119 healthcare workers. The studies measured the effects of programs at short-term (up to 3 months), medium-term (3 to 12 months), and long-term (more than 12 months) after the programs ended.\n\nThe programs were for single healthcare workers and fell into 4 types:\n- focusing on the feeling of stress;\n- focusing away from the feeling of stress;\n- changing job-related factors for a person; and\n- mixing these methods.\n\nWe compared these programs to no program, a wait list (a group who got the program later), a placebo (a 'dummy' program not expected to have any effect), or another program to lower stress.\n\n- Programs that focus on the feeling of stress may lower signs of stress for up to 1 year. Examples are mindfulness, which teaches people to focus on the present moment. Another is cognitive-behavioural therapy. This is a talking therapy that helps people manage problems by changing how they think and act. We do not know if these programs affect stress in the longer term.\n- Programs that focus away from the feeling of stress (like relaxation or exercise) may also lower signs of stress for up to 1 year. No studies reported on the long-term effects of these programs.\n- Mixing different program types may lower stress for up to 3 months. However, they may make little to no difference in the medium term (up to 1 year). We do not know if mixing programs affects stress in the longer term.\n- We are not sure if programs that change job-related factors for a person affect signs of stress. It is also not clear if one type of program is better than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
