This is because we found no completed studies.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits, risks, and long-term effects of using dexmedetomidine for these babies.\n\nWhy do newborn babies on breathing machines need pain relief and sedation?\nVery ill newborn babies may need a machine to help them breathe. This can be uncomfortable or painful. Doctors often give these babies medicines for pain relief and to keep them calm and comfortable. The most common medicines are strong painkillers like morphine, which is a type of opioid (a class of strong pain-relieving drugs). However, these can have serious side effects. Some researchers think a different medicine, dexmedetomidine, may be a safer option because it might have less effect on the baby's heart rate and blood pressure. Although it is being used more often for babies, it is not officially approved for this use.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well dexmedetomidine works and how safe it is for newborn babies on breathing machines. We wanted to compare it with other medicines for pain relief and sedation, or a dummy treatment (a placebo, which has no medicine in it).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other drugs or a placebo in newborn babies on breathing machines. We planned to combine and summarize the results of the studies and rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no completed studies that met our criteria. However, we found 4 ongoing studies that may be included in future updates of this review.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe cannot be confident in the evidence because we found no completed studies.\n\nDate of the search\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
