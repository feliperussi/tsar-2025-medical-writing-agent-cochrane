This is because of weaknesses in the studies we found. The studies did not report on other unwanted effects (adverse events).\n- We need future, better-designed studies to give us more reliable information about the benefits and harms of using these glues in blood vessel surgery.\n\nWhat is the problem?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons sometimes create a join between blood vessels, or between a blood vessel and a man-made tube (a graft). Surgeons call this join an 'anastomosis'. The needle holes from sewing the join can sometimes bleed. Doctors call the process of stopping this bleeding 'hemostasis'. To help stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply special materials called 'sealants' directly to the join. These act like a glue or patch. Surgeons use them with standard methods when those methods do not work well enough. However, we are not sure how well these sealants work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding from these joins in people having blood vessel surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers assign people by chance to one of two or more treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared using surgical sealants with other methods to stop bleeding during blood vessel surgery. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies with a total of 2376 people having blood vessel surgery. The studies compared using sealants made from fibrin (a protein that helps blood clot) or synthetic (man-made) materials with standard methods. These methods included manual compression (applying pressure), oxidized cellulose (a plant-based material), and gelatin sponges.\n\nWhen surgeons use sealants to stop bleeding from joins made during blood vessel surgery, we found that:\n- sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop the bleeding.\n- we are not sure if using sealants affects whether the attempt to stop bleeding is successful.\n- sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the surgery takes, bleeding after the surgery (postoperative bleeding), or the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\n\nWe could not assess the effects of sealants on death from bleeding or on quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). This was because none of the studies reported on these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons.\n- People in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have influenced the results (a flaw in study design called bias).\n- The studies included different types of people and procedures.\n- We did not find enough studies to be certain about the results.\n- The available studies may show bigger benefits than actually exist. This is because studies with positive results are more likely to be published (a problem called publication bias).\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review includes evidence up to March 2023.",
