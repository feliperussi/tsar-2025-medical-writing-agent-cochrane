The studies did not report on any unwanted effects of these therapies. We found no studies that looked at using medicines for this purpose.\n- More research is needed to understand how well talking therapies work and if they have any unwanted effects. Future studies should also look at whether medicines can safely help pregnant women who have problems with alcohol.\n\nWhy is it important to address alcohol use during pregnancy?\nDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can be harmful to the unborn baby. Despite this, many women continue to drink alcohol while pregnant. Globally, about 1 in 10 pregnant women drink alcohol, and in Europe, this number is as high as 1 in 4. Help can include talking therapies (also known as psychosocial interventions), such as counselling, or medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective talking therapies and medicines are at helping pregnant women to stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We also wanted to know if women stayed with the treatment and if there were any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared talking therapies or medicines with usual care or no treatment for pregnant women who drink alcohol. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with 1369 pregnant women who received an intervention to reduce or stop their alcohol use. The studies looked at brief talking therapies and compared them with usual care.\n\nThe evidence suggests that talking therapies may increase the number of women who stop drinking alcohol completely. For women who continue to drink, talking therapies may have little to no effect on the number of drinks they have per day, but we are very uncertain about this finding. Talking therapies probably make little to no difference to the number of women who complete the treatment. None of the studies looked at potential unwanted effects of the treatments. We found no studies that looked at using medicines to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, it is possible that women in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Second, not all studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. Finally, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
