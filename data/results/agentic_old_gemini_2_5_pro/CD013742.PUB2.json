However, they are better at correctly identifying people who do not have it.\n- We are not certain about these findings because the studies we found were not designed to check the accuracy of these tests. We need future studies designed for this purpose to give us more reliable results.\n\n**What is vitamin A deficiency?**\n\nVitamin A is a nutrient our bodies need to stay healthy. A shortage of vitamin A (deficiency) can lead to serious health problems. These include poor growth, a weakened immune system (the body's defense against infection), and eye problems that can cause blindness. It also increases the risk of death for mothers and children. Because of these dangers, it is important to have reliable tests to find out if a person has a vitamin A deficiency so they can get the right treatment.\n\n**What tests are used to check for vitamin A deficiency?**\n\nDoctors can use several lab tests to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body, usually with a blood sample. However, we are not sure how accurate these common tests are. To find out a test's accuracy, we compare its results to a 'reference standard'. A reference standard is the most accurate testing method available. In this review, we call the common tests 'index tests'.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how accurate different lab tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people who might have it. We wanted to know how well these tests correctly identify people who have the deficiency (a measure called sensitivity) and people who do not (a measure called specificity).\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared common tests for vitamin A deficiency against the most accurate tests available (the 'reference standard'). We then combined the results from these studies. We used a system called GRADE to rate how confident we are in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 40 studies that looked at how well certain lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nThe common lab tests, such as those measuring serum retinol (a form of vitamin A in the blood) and retinol-binding protein (a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood), often fail to detect vitamin A deficiency in people who have it.\n\nHowever, these tests are probably good at correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency.\n\n**How reliable is the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because the studies we included were not specifically designed to measure the accuracy of the tests. Also, some studies did not provide all the data we needed, and the evidence is based on very small studies with few people who had vitamin A deficiency.\n\n**How up to date is this review?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
