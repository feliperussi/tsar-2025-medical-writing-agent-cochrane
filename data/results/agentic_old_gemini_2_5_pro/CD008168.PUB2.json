Bilirubin is the substance in the blood that causes jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n- We found very little information about possible harmful effects on the brain.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to be certain that giving light therapy in cycles is as effective and safe as giving it without a break for both full-term and premature babies.\n\nWhat is jaundice in newborn babies and how is it treated?\nJaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that makes their skin and the whites of their eyes turn yellow. It is caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood. A widely used and effective treatment is phototherapy, which uses special lights to help the baby's body break down bilirubin. Traditionally, phototherapy is given continuously, meaning the baby stays under the lights without breaks. An alternative (another choice) is intermittent phototherapy, where the baby has breaks from being under the lights. This could have practical benefits, like making it easier for mothers to feed and bond with their babies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two types of phototherapy to find out if giving it in cycles is as safe and effective (works as well) as giving it continuously for treating jaundice in newborn babies.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared intermittent phototherapy (light therapy with breaks) to continuous phototherapy for newborn babies with jaundice. We then compared and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 12 studies with 1600 newborn infants with jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. Our main finding is that intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall compared with continuous phototherapy. It is unclear if either treatment affects the risk of brain dysfunction (a state where the brain does not function normally) caused by high bilirubin levels. There may also be little to no difference in treatment failure or the number of infant deaths, but the evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies included different types of babies and were very small. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results for important safety outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",
