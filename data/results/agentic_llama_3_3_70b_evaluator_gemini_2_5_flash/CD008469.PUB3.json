  "text": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma (a common lung condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath)?\nWe want to find out if educating children with asthma at home works better than usual care or education given in another place, like a clinic. We also want to know which parts of the education program are most helpful.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it hard to breathe. Asthma symptoms can be triggered by 'triggers' like allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions), exercise, and respiratory infections. We educate people about asthma to manage the condition, which includes understanding how the disease works and learning skills to manage it themselves, like avoiding triggers. Asthma affects 262.4 million people worldwide.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested home-based asthma education for children and their families. We only included 'randomized controlled trials', where researchers put people into treatment groups by chance. We compared the results of the studies, assessed their quality, and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The people in the studies differed in age and in the severity of their asthma (from mild to severe). Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but we have very low confidence in this finding. We are not sure if home-based education helps with other things, like reducing emergency visits or hospital stays, because the evidence is very uncertain. However, more-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited because the people and the education programs in the studies were very different from each other. In some studies, families and researchers knew which treatment group they were in, which could have influenced the results. Also, some studies did not report all of the results they collected.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may make little to no difference to the number of emergency visits for sudden asthma flare-ups compared to usual care. We have very low confidence in this evidence.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life for children with asthma, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\n- More-intensive education at home may reduce hospital stays compared to less-intensive education - we have low confidence in this finding.\n- Future researchers should study what the best educational programs are and where they should take place. This will help guide healthcare providers and families on the best ways to manage asthma in children.",
