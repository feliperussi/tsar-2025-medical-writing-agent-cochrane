  "text": "Do topical repellents help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nKey messages:\n- Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria.\n- However, the evidence is not strong, so we cannot be certain of this effect.\n- Topical repellents are more likely to help people who are at high risk of getting malaria, such as refugees or those who cannot use other prevention methods like bed nets or indoor sprays.\n\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high mosquito populations. Common treatments for malaria include medications like antimalarial drugs, as well as preventive measures like bed nets treated with insect-killer and spraying insect-killer on the inside walls of homes (called indoor residual spraying). However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as for people who spend a lot of time outdoors or in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether topical repellents can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. We looked at studies that compared the use of topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria. We wanted to know whether these repellents can reduce the number of malaria cases in different populations, including those at high risk of infection like refugees, military personnel, and forest workers.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of topical repellents in preventing malaria. We looked at randomized controlled trials and cluster-randomized controlled trials that compared topical repellents with no repellent or with other methods of preventing malaria. We also assessed the risk of bias in the included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 relevant trials. Our main results are based on combining the data from 6 of these trials, which included over 61,000 people. Based on low-certainty evidence, our analysis showed that using a topical repellent may slightly reduce a person's chance of getting sick with malaria. Topical repellents are considered safe. Very few people had side effects, and these were mostly mild skin reactions.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in some studies, participants knew they were using a repellent, which could have influenced their behavior. Second, some studies did not report all their results. Third, some trials were small. This means the results might not be as accurate, and we can't be sure they would apply to everyone.\n\nWhat are the implications of the findings?\nMore research is needed to confirm these findings. The review suggests that repellents might be most helpful for high-risk groups, like refugees, who may not have access to other protective measures like bed nets. In places where other methods are already used, the extra benefit of repellents is likely to be small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
