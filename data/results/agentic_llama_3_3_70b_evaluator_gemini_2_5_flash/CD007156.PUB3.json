  "text": "What Treatments Are Effective for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\n- We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and harms of different treatments for managing oral submucous fibrosis, including different types of drugs, surgery, and physiotherapy.\n- Future research should include well-designed studies that are large enough to provide reliable results. These studies should test treatments that make sense for this condition and measure effects that matter most to patients, such as pain reduction and ability to eat normally.\n\nWhat is Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting condition of the mouth. It causes the inside of the cheeks and mouth to slowly tighten, which can cause severe pain and make it hard to open your mouth fully. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing.\n\nWhat are the Common Treatments for Oral Submucous Fibrosis?\nThe main treatment is helping people stop habits, such as chewing areca nut. Other treatments include different types of drugs. These can be taken by mouth, injected into the cheek, or applied directly to the affected area. Surgical procedures and other therapies, like physiotherapy or ultrasound, may also be used.\n\nWhat did the Review Authors Want to Find Out?\nWe wanted to see how well different treatments improved symptoms like mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we Find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis. Researchers conducted these studies in various countries, and the studies lasted for different lengths of time, from less than three months to over six months. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants probably improve mouth opening slightly and reduce burning sensation. For all other treatments reviewed, the evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning we cannot be confident about their effects.\n\nWhat are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many studies were very small. In some, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. The studies also did not always include the range of people, treatments, or results that are most important. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow did we Conduct this Review?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis and summarized their results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of the treatments.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
