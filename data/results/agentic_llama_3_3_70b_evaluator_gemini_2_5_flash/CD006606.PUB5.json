It is a leading cause of infertility, with 50% of women with PCOS experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS often have trouble with ovulation, which can lead to irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and other hormonal imbalances.\n\nWhat are the challenges with current fertility treatments for women with PCOS?\nCurrent fertility treatments for women with PCOS, such as IVF, can be challenging due to the high risk of OHSS. OHSS occurs when the ovaries produce too many eggs in response to fertility medications, leading to swelling, pain, and other complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if IVM followed by IVF is a safe and effective treatment for women with PCOS. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of IVM with IVF in terms of live birth rates, miscarriage rates, and other pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing IVM with IVF in women with PCOS. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 women with PCOS who were having difficulty getting pregnant and were using fertility treatments. Two of the studies had flaws in their methods that could have produced unreliable results, which lowers our confidence in their findings. We are very uncertain about the effect of IVM on live birth compared to IVF. IVM increases miscarriage and reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included a small number of women, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Second, the women and the specific IVM treatments they received were different across the studies, which means the findings may not apply to everyone with PCOS.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nMore high-quality research is needed to be sure about the benefits and risks of IVM. Future studies should focus on how IVM affects live birth and miscarriage rates. This will give women with PCOS and their doctors clearer information to help them make decisions.",
