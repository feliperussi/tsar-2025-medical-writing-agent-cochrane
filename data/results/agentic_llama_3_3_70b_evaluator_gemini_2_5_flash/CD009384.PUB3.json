  "text": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years? \nWe found that giving children zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. \nIt's essential to weigh the good and bad effects, especially where children are at high risk of zinc deficiency. This means their bodies don't have enough zinc to grow well.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem? \nZinc deficiency is when a child's body doesn't have enough zinc, an important nutrient. \nThis is common in low- and middle-income countries and can cause children to get sick, die, or not grow properly. \nZinc is crucial for the body to work properly - it helps the immune system fight infections, heal wounds, and build and repair tissues.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements could prevent deaths, illness, and growth problems. \nWe also looked at how zinc supplements could help or harm children, for example, if they changed their risk of getting diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections (infections in the lungs), or malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes).\n\nHow did we search for studies? \nWe looked for studies in major medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as five other databases and one register of ongoing trials. \nOur search was up to February 2022, and we focused on studies called “randomized controlled trials”, as these provide the most reliable evidence.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data? \nTwo of us reviewed each study and collected information on how it was done, who the children were, the dose of zinc they took, and for how long. \nWe looked at the effects on death, illness, and growth. \nWe then grouped similar studies together to understand the overall results.\n\nHow did we rate the certainty of the evidence? \nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE. \nThis involved checking for things that could make the results less reliable, like flaws in the study designs.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. \nMost children in the studies took zinc as a syrup (zinc sulfate). \nThe usual dose was 10 mg to 15 mg per day. \nResearchers tracked the children's health for about 6 months (26 weeks).\n\nWhat were the main findings about zinc supplementation for children? \nGiving children zinc supplements probably reduces how often children get diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. \nHowever, it may make little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection (an infection in the lungs), or malaria. \nFor every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting. \nThe benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. \nThe studies included children of different ages and health backgrounds, and they used different doses of zinc. \nThis variety makes it hard to combine the results and draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence? \nThis review updates our previous review. \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Taking zinc supplements may help prevent diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, but it's essential to weigh the good and bad effects, especially where children are at high risk of zinc deficiency.\n- Zinc supplementation was found to have little to no effect on reducing illness and death due to other causes, such as lower respiratory tract infections or malaria, in this age group, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n- Future studies should look at the long-term effects of taking zinc. They should also study how zinc works with other nutrients and find out which groups of children it helps most. This will give better advice to parents and doctors.",
