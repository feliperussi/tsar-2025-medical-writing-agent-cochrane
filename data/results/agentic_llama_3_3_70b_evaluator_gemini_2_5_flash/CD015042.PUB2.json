  "text": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\n- Brief psychosocial interventions (treatments that focus on changing behaviors and thoughts through counseling or therapy) may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong.\n- More research is needed to understand how well these interventions work, especially for women with alcohol use disorder (a condition where someone has a strong desire to drink alcohol, even if it harms their health), and to find out if there are any unwanted effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the benefits and safety of different treatments, including medications, for pregnant women who drink alcohol, and should provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use and any other health conditions they may have.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a common issue worldwide, with estimated rates of 10% globally and up to 25% in Europe. This can lead to harmful effects on the unborn baby, making it essential to address this problem. Common treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychosocial interventions and medications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to see which treatments work best to help women stop drinking, drink less, and complete their treatment. We also looked for any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that tested treatments to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We then compared and summarized their results and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands, with six of them taking place in the USA. Most studies tested how well talking therapies worked. Women usually received the therapy near the end of their first trimester. Researchers then checked on their alcohol use 8 to 24 weeks later. The women in these studies were pregnant and had problems with alcohol use. In one study, nearly half the women had a current alcohol use disorder. In another, 40% had been diagnosed with it at some point in their lives. We did not find any studies that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy.\n\nThe main findings were:\n- Brief psychosocial interventions may help more women to stop drinking alcohol completely.\n- These interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day.\n- They probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed the treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies were small, and in most cases, the women knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced their responses, which might affect the reliability of the results (this issue is sometimes called a lack of 'blinding').\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
