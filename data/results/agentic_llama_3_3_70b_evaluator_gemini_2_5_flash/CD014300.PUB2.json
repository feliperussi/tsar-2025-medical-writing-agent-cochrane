The studies reported no harmful effects, but the lack of evidence means we cannot be certain about the potential benefits or harms.\n\n- These programs may have a slight positive effect on adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- It is also unclear whether these programs have any effect on children and adolescents.\n- We need more research to learn what works best to promote mental health in these situations. Future studies should follow people for longer and consider the unique needs of different groups.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health?\nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, affect millions of people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. These crises can lead to a range of stressors that threaten mental health, including displacement, violence, and loss of loved ones. As a result, people living in humanitarian settings are at risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event.\n\nWhat are support programs and how can they help?\nSupport programs are activities designed to promote mental health and well-being. These programs can include counseling, therapy, support groups, and other activities that help individuals cope with stress and trauma. In the context of humanitarian crises, these programs can help support people's wellbeing by improving how they function in their daily lives, their ability to cope with stress, and their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if these programs improved people's overall wellbeing. This included things like their quality of life, ability to cope with stress, and how they function in their daily lives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared support programs to no program. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. Researchers conducted the studies in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most programs lasted about 18 weeks and were run by trained local helpers.\n\nFor adults, these programs may slightly improve mental wellbeing. However, for children and adolescents, we are uncertain if the programs had any effect. For adults, the studies did not measure the effect on daily functioning or social behavior. For children and adolescents, there was not enough evidence to know if the programs improved these areas.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
