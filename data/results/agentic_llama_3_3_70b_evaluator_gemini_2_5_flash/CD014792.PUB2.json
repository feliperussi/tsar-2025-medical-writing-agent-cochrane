We found little to no difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or in the problems they had after surgery. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain because it is based on only a few small studies.\n\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is also called a Whipple procedure. During the surgery, doctors also remove the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and other nearby tissues. This surgery is usually performed to treat cancer or other conditions affecting the pancreas or surrounding areas. Patients are at risk of poor nutrition after this surgery because the operation is so large and complications are common. Receiving the right nutrition after surgery is crucial for helping patients recover and survive long-term.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out about postoperative nutritional support strategies?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding patients after this surgery affect their recovery and the problems they might have. We compared various methods of nutritional support to determine which approach might be most beneficial in reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications.\n\nWhat methods did we use to find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after this surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 17 studies with 1897 participants and found that the evidence is of low to very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- Patients may have known which treatment they were getting.\n- The studies did not all report on the same health problems.\n- The studies used different feeding methods, which makes them hard to compare.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nFurther high-quality research is needed to better understand the best ways to support nutrition after this surgery, including which methods are most effective and safe for patients, and to address the current uncertainty in the evidence.",
