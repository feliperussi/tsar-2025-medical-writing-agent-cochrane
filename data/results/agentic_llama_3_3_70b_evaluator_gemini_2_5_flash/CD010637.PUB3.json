  "text": "Can exercise help people with chronic venous insufficiency (a condition where veins have problems returning blood to the heart) manage their symptoms?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if exercise helps people with chronic venous insufficiency manage their symptoms due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show if exercise improves symptoms or quality of life for people with chronic venous insufficiency.\n- Future research should investigate how different types of exercise affect chronic venous insufficiency symptoms and quality of life.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not work properly. This can lead to symptoms like pain, swelling, and skin changes. CVI can increase the risk of developing venous leg ulcers and affects people of all ages, impacting their quality of life.\n\nWhy is it important to find effective treatments for chronic venous insufficiency?\nCVI significantly impacts a person's quality of life, causing pain, discomfort, and mobility problems. Current treatments include compression stockings, elevating the legs, and sometimes surgery. However, these may not work for everyone and can have side effects. So, finding effective and safe treatments for CVI is crucial to improve the quality of life for those with this condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if physical exercise programs reduce CVI symptoms and improve quality of life. We also aimed to assess the potential harms of these programs. The goal was to evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise compared to no exercise or standard treatment for people with non-ulcerated CVI.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing exercise programs with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies involving 146 people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. These studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise program. The exercise protocols differed, and the studies were conducted over various durations. The studies looked at whether exercise improved symptoms, quality of life, muscle strength, and how well veins pumped blood. For all of these outcomes, the evidence was not clear enough to show a benefit from exercise.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
