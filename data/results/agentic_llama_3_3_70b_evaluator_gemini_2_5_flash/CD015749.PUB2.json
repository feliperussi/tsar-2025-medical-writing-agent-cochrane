  "text": "Can combined treatments like medication, nutrition, and exercise help manage cachexia, a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness, better than usual care? \n\nWe looked at studies that combined two or more of these approaches to see if they could improve physical function, strength, and quality of life for people with cachexia. \n- Cachexia is a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness. Treatments that combine different approaches, like medication, nutrition, and exercise, might help manage it. However, we lack strong evidence to say if these combined treatments are better than usual care for people with chronic illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, or heart disease.\n- The current evidence does not show clear benefits or harms of multimodal interventions for cachexia management. We are very uncertain about the benefits and harms of these combined treatments. The studies did not show clear effects, either helpful or harmful.\n- We need more and better research to be sure if these combined treatments can help people with cachexia.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem? \nCachexia is a serious condition that causes the body to waste away. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses like cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia unintentionally lose weight and muscle, feel fatigued, lose their appetite, and have a reduced quality of life. Cachexia weakens physical function, strength, and overall health, making it difficult for people to perform daily activities and enjoy life.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia? \nMultimodal interventions combine two or more treatments, like medication, nutrition, and exercise. They aim to meet the complex needs of people with cachexia. These interventions might help ease the symptoms of cachexia or stop them from getting worse, improving physical function, strength, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, and quality of life, and reduce the symptoms of cachexia, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss. The authors also wanted to evaluate the certainty of the evidence for these interventions and identify areas for further research.\n\nHow did we do this review? \nWe searched for studies on multimodal interventions for cachexia management, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these interventions.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe included nine studies with 926 adults. The evidence for all outcomes was very uncertain. Compared to usual care, there was no clear evidence for an effect of multimodal interventions on physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, or biochemical markers. Quality of life was not reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding, as participants may have known which treatment they received.\n\nHow up to date is this review? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
