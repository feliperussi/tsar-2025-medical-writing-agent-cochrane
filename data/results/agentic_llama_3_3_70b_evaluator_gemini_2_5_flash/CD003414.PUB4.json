  "text": "What is the best way to prepare the womb for transferring a frozen embryo?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not know which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- The available evidence does not show a clear difference in effectiveness between natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle regimens.\n- We need more research to compare these methods and help people choose the best treatment for them.\n\nWhat is frozen embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen embryo transfer (FET) is a fertility treatment where a previously frozen embryo is placed into a woman's womb. FET is becoming more common because it can increase the chance of getting pregnant over time, costs less, and is a fairly simple procedure. We need to find the most effective and safest method to prepare the womb for FET.\n\nWhat are the different cycle regimens for FET and how do they work?\nThere are several cycle regimens used for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET. Natural cycle FET involves transferring the embryo during a woman's natural menstrual cycle. In a hormone therapy (HT) cycle, doctors use hormones to prepare the womb. In an ovulation induction cycle, they use drugs to help the ovaries release eggs (ovulation). Each regimen has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which method was best for having a baby, lowering the chance of miscarriage, and causing the fewest side effects. We compared the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different ways of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer. We looked at studies that compared natural cycle FET, HT FET, and ovulation induction FET.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different cycle regimens, including natural cycle, hormone therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. However, the evidence was often of low certainty. This means we cannot be confident in the results, and the true effect could be very different from what the studies found.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and many did not report important results, such as live birth or miscarriage rates. This means we cannot be certain about the best approach for frozen embryo transfer.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot be certain which method is best for preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer. The evidence we found was of low certainty, so it does not show a clear difference in the chance of a live birth between the different methods. We need more well-designed research that measures important outcomes, like live birth and miscarriage rates, to help people choose the best treatment for them.",
