  "text": "Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are unsure if favipiravir works for COVID-19 because the evidence is not strong enough, and it may cause more unwanted or harmful effects (side effects).\n- Researchers studied favipiravir in several randomized controlled trials to see how well it works for people with COVID-19. They found that favipiravir may not make a difference in whether people need to go to the hospital, need oxygen therapy, or recover from COVID-19.\n- We need more research to understand the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19 and to get high-quality evidence to inform decisions.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 (a type of coronavirus). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 include supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments.\n\nWhat is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?\nResearchers suggest favipiravir as a potential treatment for COVID-19. They studied it in several randomized controlled trials to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19. People usually take a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days. However, it is still unclear if favipiravir is a useful treatment for COVID-19.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see how well favipiravir worked for people with COVID-19 compared to no treatment, standard care (the usual care given to people with COVID-19), or other antiviral drugs. We wanted to find out if favipiravir, compared to other treatments, could reduce the risk of death, prevent people from needing to go to the hospital, stop the illness from getting worse and requiring a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), or help people get better faster.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing favipiravir to other treatments for COVID-19, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nResearchers conducted 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease and were under 60 years of age. These studies were conducted in 13 countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days.\n\nWhat are the main results of favipiravir for COVID-19?\nFavipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or the time to clinical improvement for people with COVID-19. However, it may cause more side effects. We are not sure if favipiravir reduces the risk of dying from any cause, needing a breathing machine, or having other serious side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. These factors can make the results less reliable. Not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",
