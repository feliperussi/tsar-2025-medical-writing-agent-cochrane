It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic'. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes swelling. \n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. We compared infliximab to a dummy treatment, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at how many people's symptoms came back and if people had any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. For every 100 people taking a dummy treatment, about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse. Infliximab combined with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing symptoms from coming back than purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of symptoms coming back between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons: \n- The studies included only a small number of people.\n- In some studies, people may have known if they were getting the real medicine or a dummy treatment. This can affect the results, because knowing you are on a real treatment can sometimes make you feel better.\n- The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
