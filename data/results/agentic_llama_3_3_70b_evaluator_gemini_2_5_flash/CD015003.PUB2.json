It may also increase the risk of diarrhea (loose, watery stools).\n- We do not know if colchicine can prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular events in people without a history of these problems. This is because the current evidence is not clear, and we need more research to understand its effects.\n- Future studies should look at the long-term effects of colchicine and its potential benefits and harms in preventing cardiovascular events. The current evidence is limited because the studies were small, and the participants may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nWhat is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is when fatty substances clog the arteries, leading to chronic inflammation and potentially life-threatening complications. It is a leading cause of death and disability around the world, putting a strain on healthcare systems and affecting the quality of life for millions of people. Common treatments for ACVD often focus on managing symptoms and reducing risk factors, but there is a need for effective preventive measures.\n\nWhat is colchicine and how might it help with ACVD prevention?\nColchicine is a cheap drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been used for centuries. It might help prevent ACVD because it can reduce inflammation, a key factor in the development of the disease. However, we still do not know if colchicine can prevent these heart and blood vessel problems for most people. We need more and better research to find out its true benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of using colchicine to prevent cardiovascular events in people who have not had any of these problems before. We compared colchicine to a placebo (a dummy pill), immunomodulating medications, or usual care to see if it could reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes like death from any cause, non-fatal heart attacks, stroke, and adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine to other treatments for preventing cardiovascular events. We summarized the results and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 1721 people. The studies lasted from 4 to 728 weeks. In these studies, researchers compared people taking colchicine by mouth to people taking a placebo, other anti-inflammatory drugs, or having usual care. Most of the studies focused on liver disease rather than the general population. Colchicine may reduce the risk of death from any cause, but we are very uncertain about the results. It may make little to no difference to the risk of non-fatal heart attacks, but we are very uncertain about the results. Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhea. For every 100 people taking colchicine, 10 may get diarrhea, compared to 3 out of 100 people not taking colchicine.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and the participants may have known which treatment they were getting. The evidence also does not cover all relevant populations, interventions, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",
