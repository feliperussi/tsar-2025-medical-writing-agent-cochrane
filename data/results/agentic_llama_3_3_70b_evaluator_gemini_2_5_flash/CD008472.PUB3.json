Future research should focus on results that matter most to patients, like their quality of life and recovery time.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked and then restored. This process has been shown to protect other parts of the body from damage caused by a lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery carries a significant risk of complications, including death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke. RIPC has the potential to reduce these risks by protecting the body's tissues from damage.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nWe wanted to find out if RIPC reduces the risk of complications (like death, heart attack, or stroke) for people having major vascular surgery. We also looked for any unwanted effects to understand the overall benefits and harms of the technique.\n\nMethods\nWhat studies did we look for?\nWe looked for studies that randomly assigned adults having planned surgery to either receive RIPC or no treatment. This type of study, called a randomised controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence.\nHow did we collect and analyze the data?\nWe collected data on the characteristics of the trials, the methods used, and the outcomes measured. We used a method called GRADE to judge how certain we could be about the evidence for each of these results.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nResearchers conducted these studies between 2003 and 2019. We found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The included studies compared RIPC with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has several limitations. The studies included very few participants. There were also differences in the types of people studied and how the treatment was given. Finally, only a small number of studies were included, which might overestimate the treatment's benefits.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
