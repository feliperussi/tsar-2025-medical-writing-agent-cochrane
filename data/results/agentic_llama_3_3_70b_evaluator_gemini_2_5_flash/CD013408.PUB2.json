  "text": "Do organised care services reduce deaths and hospital stays for people with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that organised care services for people with atrial fibrillation probably reduce deaths from any cause compared to usual care.\n- These services probably make little to no difference to the number of people hospitalized for any reason, but they do reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\n- The evidence was not strong enough to be certain about other benefits or harms, so more research is needed.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why is it a problem?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults where the heart beats irregularly (an irregular heartbeat). It requires careful management. If not managed properly, AF can lead to serious complications like stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related problems. Common treatments include medications to control heart rate and rhythm, and procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of different clinical service organisations for adults with atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. We aimed to find out if organised clinical services, like collaborative and virtual care models, can improve outcomes for people with AF, including reducing deaths and hospital stays.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing organised clinical service models for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies involving 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. Researchers compared organised care services—such as care led by a nurse-led team or provided through digital health apps—to usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nOrganised care services probably greatly reduce deaths from all causes. They probably make little to no difference to hospital stays for any reason, but they do reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems. We are not very certain about the effects on other outcomes, such as stroke or bleeding events, because the evidence is not strong enough.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022 and for ongoing trials up to April 2023.\n\nFuture studies should investigate the long-term effects of organised care services. They should also compare different types of organised care and measure the impact on people's quality of life. This will provide more reliable evidence to help people and their doctors decide on the best care.",
