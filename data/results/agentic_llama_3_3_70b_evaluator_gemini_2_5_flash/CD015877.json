  "text": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets?\n\nKey messages:\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. \n- We found only a few small studies, so we cannot be sure if personalized nutrition plans help or harm children and teenagers with obesity. \n- Future studies should be larger and better designed. Researchers should report on how these diets affect both the physical and mental health of children in different age groups.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem?\nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has too much body fat. It can lead to health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. Common treatments often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. However, these one-size-fits-all approaches may not work for everyone due to factors like genetics, eating habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhat are personalized nutrition plans, and how might they help?\nPersonalized nutrition plans are created specifically for an individual. They look at things like a person's genes, eating habits, and activity levels to create a diet plan that fits their unique needs. These plans aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to examine the impact of personalized nutrition plans on the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to investigate whether these tailored approaches are more effective than traditional one-size-fits-all interventions in improving physical and mental well-being.\n\nHow did the review authors conduct the study?\nThe review authors performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating personalized nutrition plans for managing obesity in children and adolescents. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, then extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. We are very uncertain if personalized nutrition plans affect weight or body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nThe evidence from these small studies is very uncertain. This means we don't know if personalized nutrition plans have an effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024. Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and that explore the effects of personalized nutrition plans in different age groups and populations.",
