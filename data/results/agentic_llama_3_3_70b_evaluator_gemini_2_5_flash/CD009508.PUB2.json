Harmful effects were rare and mostly linked to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT (squeezing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles on their own) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles). Supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference to improving quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine without meaning to. This can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women. It can happen for different reasons, for example when you leak urine when you cough or sneeze (stress incontinence), or when you feel a sudden, strong need to go to the toilet (urgency incontinence). Doctors recommend PFMT to help women who leak urine. It involves exercising the pelvic floor muscles to better control the bladder.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if some ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training work better than others for women who leak urine. We compared different ways of doing PFMT to see which worked best to improve quality of life for women with incontinence. We also looked for any harmful effects from PFMT and checked how certain the evidence was. This helps doctors and researchers make better decisions.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The women in the studies were typically middle-aged and had previously given birth. Most experienced stress-related urine leakage and had not had prior surgery for this issue. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing pelvic floor muscles at the same time) may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. The studies were also very small and involved different types of participants and methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
