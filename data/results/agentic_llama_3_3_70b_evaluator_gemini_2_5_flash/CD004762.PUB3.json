However, the quality of the evidence is not strong, meaning we are not very confident in the results.\n- Some people taking these medicines may experience unwanted effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (problems with the stomach and intestines), lethargy (feeling tired), and headache. But we did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\n- Future research should focus on finding better treatments for myotonic disorders, including studying the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness and quality of life, and exploring new treatment options for people who do not respond to current therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic condition that can also cause progressive muscle weakness and other systemic problems like arrhythmias and cataracts. Common treatments for myotonia include sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressive drugs, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to find out how well drug treatments work and what unwanted effects they might have for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. They wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing drug treatments for myotonia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 trials with 392 people. \nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, we found that:\n- Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- Lamotrigine may help muscles relax faster and may improve quality of life. Side effects can include headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
