It may improve day-to-day ear-related quality of life and may slightly reduce how often fluid remains behind the eardrum after about 3 months. We do not know if it helps more children return to normal hearing. Unwanted effects were not well measured; one study suggested ear pain might be more common with autoinflation, but pain was uncommon.\n- The studies compared autoinflation with no treatment (watchful waiting). We found no studies that compared autoinflation with surgery (ventilation tubes, also called grommets) or with other active treatments.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence. We need larger, longer studies that measure hearing, language and speech development, unwanted effects, and how easy it is for families to use the devices at home.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is glue ear and why does it matter?\nGlue ear (otitis media with effusion, OME) happens when fluid builds up behind the eardrum in the middle ear. The middle ear is the small air-filled space behind the eardrum that helps you hear. This fluid can cause hearing loss. In young children, ongoing hearing loss may affect speech and language, learning, and behaviour.\n\nGlue ear is very common in children and often gets better on its own. Some children have symptoms for months. Families and clinicians may choose to wait and watch, try medicines, or have procedures such as surgery.\n\nWhat is autoinflation?\nAutoinflation is a simple, self-help method. A child blows up a special nasal balloon or uses a small handheld device through the nose. This pushes air towards the back of the nose to help open the Eustachian tube (the small tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose). Opening this tube may let air into the middle ear and help the fluid drain. Many programs ask children to do this 2 to 3 times a day for several weeks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if autoinflation helps children with glue ear:\n- hear normally again\n- feel better in daily life (quality of life related to ear problems)\n- avoid harms, such as ear pain\nWe also looked at whether autoinflation changes how often the fluid remains in the ear over time.\n\n[Optional] How is glue ear treated?\nCommon options include:\n- watchful waiting (no active treatment for a period of time)\n- medicines, such as pain relief if needed\n- surgery to place ventilation tubes (grommets) in the eardrum\n- hearing aids in some cases\n- mechanical methods such as autoinflation\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies in children that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other options. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with 1036 children. Most children were 3 to 11 years old. The studies took place in Europe and North America, in hospitals and community clinics. All studies compared autoinflation with no treatment. Children usually used autoinflation 2 to 3 times a day for 2 to 12 weeks. Most studies checked outcomes right after the treatment period. The longest follow-up was about 11 weeks. Funding sources were not clearly reported. We did not find studies comparing autoinflation with ventilation tubes or with other active treatments.\n\nMain results:\n- Return to normal hearing: We do not know if autoinflation helps more children return to normal hearing. The evidence was based on few children and short follow-up, so we are not confident in this result.\n- Ear-related quality of life: Autoinflation may improve quality of life related to ear problems after about 3 months. Families might notice a small to moderate improvement in daily ear-related symptoms.\n- Ear pain or distress: It is unclear if autoinflation increases ear pain. One study suggested more children had ear pain with autoinflation, but pain was uncommon and the result is uncertain.\n- Fluid still present (persistence of glue ear): Autoinflation may slightly reduce the chance that fluid remains after about 3 months. For every 100 children, about 9 fewer may still have fluid if they use autoinflation compared with no treatment.\n\nWe found little or no information about longer-term outcomes such as language, speech, thinking skills, balance, listening skills, school performance, or parent stress. We also saw limited information about how well children kept up with the exercise at home.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the results because:\n- the studies were small and often short, so we cannot be sure the effects last\n- some results came from only one study\n- the studies used different devices and ways of doing autoinflation\n- all studies compared autoinflation with no treatment, so we do not know how it compares with surgery or other active treatments\n- unwanted effects were not well measured or reported\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
