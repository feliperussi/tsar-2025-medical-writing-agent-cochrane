It may improve quality of life slightly, but we are very uncertain about this. The studies did not report any harmful effects from education.\n- When home-based programs were longer or more intensive, they may reduce hospital stays caused by asthma attacks compared with shorter home programs. However, more intensive programs may still make little to no difference to emergency visits, days missed from school, or the need for steroid tablets or liquid.\n- We did not find enough good-quality, consistent evidence to be sure which type of education works best, or whether the home is the best place to deliver it. Future studies should use the same key outcomes and test which parts of an education program matter most to families.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is childhood asthma and why is education important?\nAsthma is a chronic condition, which means it lasts a long time. In asthma, the airways in the lungs are often swollen and narrow. This can cause wheeze, cough, tight chest, and shortness of breath. Asthma attacks (also called flare-ups) can be scary and may lead to hospital emergency care.\n\nTeaching families about asthma can help them learn to avoid triggers, use inhalers correctly, and follow an action plan. Education can be given in clinics, schools, or at home. Teaching at home may reach families who find it hard to get to clinics, for example due to travel or cost.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if asthma education delivered at home to children, their caregivers, or both:\n- reduces asthma attacks that need hospital emergency care\n- reduces the need for steroid tablets or liquid (oral corticosteroids) during an attack\n- improves quality of life, symptom-free days, days in school, and hospital stays\n\nHow is childhood asthma usually managed?\nChildren often use inhaled medicines to keep airways open and reduce swelling. Families learn to avoid triggers like smoke or dust, and to follow a written plan for flare-ups. Education programs aim to build these self-management skills.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies where families were placed into groups by chance (randomly), to keep groups similar. We combined and summarized the results, and we judged how much confidence we can have in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies with 5122 children and teenagers with asthma. Sixteen of these studies were similar enough for us to combine their results. The children’s ages ranged from about 1 to 18 years, and their asthma ranged from mild to severe. The home education programs were quite different. Some focused on inhaler technique and trigger control; others covered broader topics. Programs also varied in how many sessions they offered, how long they lasted, and who provided the teaching. The studies measured results at different times; the main time point was about 6 months. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nHome education versus usual care or less-intensive education done outside the home:\n- Asthma attacks needing hospital emergency care: We do not know if home education helps, because the results were very uncertain.\n- Asthma attacks needing steroid tablets or liquid: Home education may make little to no difference.\n- Quality of life: Home education may improve quality of life slightly, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Symptom-free days, days missed from school, and hospital stays: We do not know if home education helps, because the results were very uncertain.\n\nMore-intensive home education versus less-intensive home education:\n- Asthma attacks needing hospital emergency care: A more-intensive program may make little to no difference.\n- Asthma attacks needing steroid tablets or liquid: A more-intensive program may make little to no difference.\n- Hospital stays due to asthma attacks: A more-intensive program may reduce hospital stays.\n- Days missed from school: A more-intensive program may make little to no difference.\n- Quality of life and symptom-free days: It is unclear if there is any benefit; we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nNone of the studies reported unwanted or harmful effects from education programs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the findings. People in the studies likely knew which type of education they received, which can affect how they report symptoms and use care. The programs were very different from each other, and the children varied in age and asthma severity. Studies measured results at different times and in different ways, and some studies were small. Not all studies looked at the same outcomes, and few reported unwanted effects. These issues make it hard to be sure about how well home education works and which parts of programs matter most.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
