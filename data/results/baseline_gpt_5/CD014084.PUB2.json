  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery, which opens blocked sinuses) help people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if adding sinus surgery to medical treatment helps people with cystic fibrosis who have long-lasting nose and sinus problems with nasal polyps. The single, very small study did not show clear benefits for nose symptoms or lung health. It also did not show clear effects on infections, use of antibiotics, or lung flare-ups (sudden worsening). One person had bleeding during surgery, which was fixed during the operation. The study did not report other harms or survival.\n- The only study included young adults and compared salty water nose rinses alone with nose rinses plus surgery. We do not know if these results apply to children or older people.\n- We need larger, better studies in many hospitals. These studies should follow people for at least 12 months, include people of all ages, report both benefits and harms, and consider new cystic fibrosis medicines that improve the faulty protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, modulators).\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and what are nasal polyps?\nCystic fibrosis is a lifelong condition you are born with. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs. This can lead to infections and breathing problems. It can also affect the nose and sinuses.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis means long-lasting swelling inside the nose and sinus spaces. Nasal polyps are soft, painless growths inside the nose. They can block the nose, reduce smell, and make sinus problems worse.\n\nWhy might sinus surgery be used?\nDoctors sometimes use endoscopic sinus surgery for people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. Endoscopic sinus surgery uses a thin camera passed through the nose to open blocked sinus passages. The goal is to improve drainage so that medical treatments, like nose sprays and rinses, can work better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery, by itself or together with medical treatment, helps people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We looked for effects on:\n- Nose symptoms\n- Lung health and breathing tests (how well the lungs work)\n- Hospital stays, use of antibiotics, and lung flare-ups (sudden worsening that often needs extra treatment)\nWe also looked for unwanted effects from surgery and any effects on survival.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery plus medical treatment with medical treatment alone in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. We summarized the results and judged how confident we can be in the findings, based on study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 1 study with 28 young adults aged 19 to 28. People in the study had cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They were put at random into 2 groups. One group used nasal irrigation (rinsing with salty water). The other group used nasal irrigation plus surgery to remove polyps and open the sinuses. The study did not report where it took place or who funded it. We did not find studies in children or older adults. The study did not report how long people were followed after treatment.\n\nMain results\n- Nose symptoms: We do not know if adding sinus surgery improves nose symptoms compared with medical treatment alone. The evidence is too limited to be sure.\n- Lung health: We do not know if adding sinus surgery changes lung function (breathing test results). The study did not show a clear effect.\n- Infections and antibiotic use: We do not know if adding surgery reduces bacteria living in the nose and sinuses, reduces antibiotic use, or lowers the number of lung flare-ups. The results were unclear.\n- Unwanted effects: One person had bleeding during surgery, which the surgeons stopped during the operation. The study did not report other harms. It did not report survival.\n\nPutting these findings into plain language:\n- For nose symptoms, lung function, infections, antibiotic use, and flare-ups: We do not know if adding surgery has an effect, because the evidence comes from only one very small study with limited information.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there was only one very small study, and it did not report on all outcomes we care about, like survival and detailed harms. People and doctors likely knew who had surgery, which can affect how symptoms are reported. With so few people, we cannot be sure the results apply to all people with cystic fibrosis, especially children and older adults.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
