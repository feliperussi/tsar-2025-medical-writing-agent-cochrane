Reports of unwanted effects (side effects and complications) were limited and varied, so we do not know which option is safer.\n- Some small studies suggested that surgery might keep the access open at 30 days better than mechanical thrombectomy, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Future research should include larger, well-designed studies that compare the main options separately for fistulas and grafts, follow people for longer, and report outcomes that matter to people on dialysis, such as being able to use the access for dialysis, how long it stays open, need for a temporary catheter, infections, hospital stays, quality of life, and harms.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is a dialysis fistula or graft, and why can it clot?\nPeople with kidney failure often need haemodialysis. For this, they need a strong blood access in the arm. A fistula is a surgical link between an artery and a vein. A graft is a soft tube that joins an artery to a vein. Either one can become blocked by a blood clot. This is called a thrombosed access (clotted access). When this happens, the access cannot be used for dialysis.\n\nWhy does this matter for people on haemodialysis?\nIf the fistula or graft is clotted, people often need a temporary catheter (a thin tube in a large vein) for dialysis. Catheters can raise the risk of infection, vein damage, and hospital stays. Quickly clearing the clot and keeping the access open are very important. “Patency” means the access stays open and usable. “Primary patency” means it stays open without needing another procedure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which treatments work best and are safest for clearing clots in dialysis fistulas and grafts. We looked at surgery, mechanical clot removal, and clot-dissolving medicines. We focused on whether the access stayed open at 30 days, whether the procedure worked at the time (technical success), whether the access failed again, and any unwanted effects.\n\nHow are clotted fistulas and grafts treated?\n- Surgery: the surgeon opens, repairs, or reconnects the access to remove the clot and fix the cause of the blockage.\n- Mechanical thrombectomy: devices are used to break up and remove the clot through the blood vessel.\n- Thrombolysis: medicines are used to dissolve the clot, sometimes with a catheter placed into the clot.\n- Endovascular techniques: treatments done inside the blood vessel using thin tubes (catheters), often combined with angioplasty (stretching a narrow area).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways to clear clots from dialysis fistulas and grafts. We summarized and compared their results and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1176 people on haemodialysis with a clotted fistula or graft. The studies compared surgery, mechanical thrombectomy devices, and clot-dissolving medicines. Most studies were small, used different methods, and often followed people for a short time (commonly around 30 days). Some studies had support from medical device companies. Outcomes that matter to people—such as being able to complete dialysis, symptoms, quality of life, and death—were rarely reported.\n\nMain results\n- Keeping the access open at 30 days (primary patency): It is unclear whether surgery, mechanical thrombectomy, or clot-dissolving medicines are better than the others. Some small studies suggested surgery might keep the access open at 30 days better than mechanical thrombectomy, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Failure of the access: It is unclear whether any treatment lowers the chance of the access failing again soon after the procedure.\n- Technical success (whether the procedure opens the access at the time): It is unclear whether any treatment has higher technical success than the others.\n- Unwanted effects (serious and non-serious): Reports were limited and varied, so it is unclear which treatment is safer.\n- Other important outcomes: Death, problems using the access for dialysis, and outcomes important to people on dialysis (for example, symptoms and quality of life) were rarely reported, so we do not know the effects of the treatments on these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies were very small and had weaknesses in how they were done. The studies often used different techniques and measured different outcomes, which makes them hard to compare. Some studies had company funding, which can influence results. Important outcomes for people on dialysis were rarely reported, and follow-up was often short.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
