They may make little to no difference to unwanted effects compared with placebo or usual symptom care, but we are unsure if they reduce the chance of kidney failure because the studies were small and short. Many studies did not report harms clearly.\n- Tonsil removal (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein or blood in the urine goes away and may reduce relapses, but this finding comes from studies in Japanese people only. We do not know if it applies to people in other countries.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be sure about other options such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), fish oil, traditional Chinese medicines, or antimalarial medicines. Future research should include larger groups of people, follow them for longer, report harms clearly, and include people from different countries.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease where a protein made by the immune system (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This can cause blood and protein to leak into the urine. Over time, some people’s kidneys get worse and may fail. Kidney failure means the kidneys can no longer clean the blood well and people may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nWhat are non-immunosuppressive treatments?\nNon-immunosuppressive treatments are ways to manage IgAN that do not weaken the immune system. They include:\n- RAS blockers, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which are blood pressure medicines that also protect the kidneys\n- Blood thinners (anticoagulants), which help stop harmful blood clots\n- Fish oil (omega-3 supplements)\n- Dietary changes and vitamin or mineral supplements\n- Tonsil removal surgery (tonsillectomy)\n- Herbal or traditional medicines\n- Antimalarial medicines (medicines used to treat malaria that can also affect the immune system in other ways)\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which non-immune treatments help people with IgAN live well for longer. We looked for benefits such as protecting kidney function, reducing protein in the urine, and lowering blood pressure. We also looked for unwanted effects, such as side effects from medicines or problems after surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where people with IgAN were assigned to different treatments and compared outcomes (in some studies, people were assigned randomly to keep the groups similar). We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 people with IgAN. This update added 24 newer studies. Studies included adults and children. Many studies were small and did not last long enough to show long-term effects on kidney failure or heart problems. Not all studies reported harms. RAS blockers (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) were studied the most. Tonsillectomy studies were done in Japanese people. Other approaches included blood thinners, fish oil, antimalarial medicines, and traditional Chinese medicines.\n\nMain results\n- RAS blockers compared with placebo or no treatment: RAS blockers probably reduce protein in the urine. They may make little to no difference to the chance of kidney failure or protein going away completely. Unwanted effects may be similar to placebo or no treatment.\n- RAS blockers compared with usual symptom care: RAS blockers probably reduce protein in the urine and probably improve measures of kidney function. It is unclear if they reduce the risk of kidney failure because the evidence is based on very small and short studies. Unwanted effects may be similar to usual symptom care.\n- Tonsillectomy plus standard care compared with standard care alone: Tonsillectomy may increase the chance that protein or blood in the urine goes away and may reduce relapses. We have concerns about how well this applies outside Japan, and we do not know about effects on kidney failure or death because these were not reported.\n- Blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines: These may improve kidney function slightly when compared to no treatment or placebo. However, when compared to standard care, they may make little to no difference. The evidence is not strong enough to be sure.\n- Antimalarial medicines: In one small study, antimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine. We are not sure about unwanted effects because very few events were reported.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with IgAN?\n- RAS blockers (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) are likely to help reduce protein in the urine and may protect kidney function. We are unsure if they reduce the chance of kidney failure because studies were small and short.\n- Tonsillectomy may help some people, but the evidence comes from Japanese studies only and we do not know if the benefits apply to other groups.\n- For other treatments, we do not have enough reliable information to know if they help or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little to moderate confidence in most findings. Many studies were small and short, and often did not report important outcomes such as kidney failure, death, or harms. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they received. The tonsillectomy evidence is from Japanese people only, so it may not apply to other groups. Because of these issues, we cannot be certain about long-term benefits or risks for many treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",
