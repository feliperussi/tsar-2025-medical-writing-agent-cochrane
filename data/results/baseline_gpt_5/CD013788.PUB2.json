  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs taking out the urinary catheter early (within 5 days) after a kidney transplant better than taking it out later?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if removing the urinary catheter early or later after a kidney transplant changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). Information about painful urinary tract infections (UTIs) and serious urine flow problems that need treatment was missing or not well reported.\n- The studies were small, short, and gave limited details. Because of this, we cannot tell if early removal helps or harms people compared with later removal.\n- Future research should include larger, well-designed studies that follow people for longer and report outcomes that matter to patients, such as UTIs, problems at the join between the ureter and bladder, comfort, and time in hospital.\n\nWhat is a urinary catheter and why is it used after kidney transplant?\nA kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney into someone with severe kidney disease. During and after the surgery, doctors place a urinary catheter (a thin tube) into the bladder to drain urine. This helps protect the new connection between the ureter (the tube from the kidney) and the bladder, so the join can heal.\n\nKeeping a catheter for a long time can make it easier for bacteria to enter the bladder. This may lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI). A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system and can cause burning when peeing, pain, fever, and frequent urination.\n\nWhy does the timing of catheter removal matter?\nSome doctors remove the catheter early, within 5 days of the transplant. Others wait 5 days or more. Early removal might lower infection risk because the tube is in the bladder for fewer days. Later removal might protect the healing join for longer. We wanted to know which timing works better and is safer.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if removing the catheter early (within 5 days) compared with later (5 days or more) changes:\n- asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without symptoms),\n- symptomatic UTIs,\n- major urine flow problems that need treatment, such as a leak at the join between the ureter and bladder.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared early versus later catheter removal after kidney transplant, summarized their results, and rated how much confidence we could have in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that included 197 people who had a kidney transplant. One study was a full report, and one was a short conference summary with limited information. The studies compared taking out the catheter within 5 days versus at 5 days or later. They followed people for a short time, up to 1 month. The countries, ages, and funding sources were not clearly reported.\n\nMain results:\n- Asymptomatic bacteriuria: We do not know if removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms compared with removing it later. The evidence was too limited to be sure.\n- Symptomatic UTIs and major urine flow problems: The studies did not provide enough information about painful UTIs or serious problems that need treatment, such as leaks at the join between the ureter and bladder.\n- Other outcomes that matter to patients, such as comfort, pain, bladder healing, time in hospital, or quality of life, were not reported or were unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and only followed people for a short time. The studies used different methods and reported limited details, so results may not apply to all people who have a kidney transplant. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which timing they received, and not all studies provided data on the outcomes we cared about most.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
