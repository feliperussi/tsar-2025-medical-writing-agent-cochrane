  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo birth control pills that contain drospirenone help with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and what are the side effects?\n\nKey Messages\n– Birth control pills that contain drospirenone (a progestin hormone) and ethinylestradiol (a form of estrogen) may reduce premenstrual symptoms slightly to moderately in people with severe PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). They may also cause more side effects than a dummy pill (placebo). Serious side effects, like blood clots, were not reported in these studies.\n– We did not find any studies that compared drospirenone pills with other types of birth control pills. It is also unclear if these pills improve mood or help people with milder PMS.\n– We need more good-quality research that compares different pills directly, follows people for longer than about 3 menstrual cycles, and includes people with less severe symptoms. We did not find enough robust evidence to answer all these questions.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and PMDD?\nPMS is a set of physical and emotional symptoms that happen before a period and ease after it starts. Common symptoms include bloating, breast pain, tiredness, irritability, and low mood.\n\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS. PMDD causes strong mood symptoms that affect daily life, such as work, social activities, and relationships.\n\nWhat are birth control pills with drospirenone?\nCombined oral contraceptives, often called “the pill,” contain 2 hormones: estrogen and progestin. Drospirenone is a type of progestin. Ethinylestradiol is a form of estrogen. Some pills that contain drospirenone and a low dose of estrogen are approved to treat PMDD for people who also want contraception.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether birth control pills that contain drospirenone help reduce PMS and PMDD symptoms. We also wanted to know about unwanted effects, including how often people stop taking the pill because of side effects.\n\n[Optional] How is PMS treated?\nPeople may try:\n– lifestyle changes (such as sleep, exercise, and stress reduction)\n– antidepressant medicines (for example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)\n– pain relief medicines\n– birth control pills\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared drospirenone-containing birth control pills with a placebo or with other birth control pills. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that included 858 women, most diagnosed with PMDD. The studies mainly compared a drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol pill with a placebo. We did not find studies that compared drospirenone pills with other birth control pills.\n\nMain results\n– Overall premenstrual symptoms and daily functioning: Drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol may reduce overall premenstrual symptoms slightly to moderately. It may also reduce problems with daily life, such as productivity, social activities, and relationships. These findings mainly apply to people with PMDD.\n\n– Mood symptoms: We do not know whether drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol improves mood when mood is measured with tools not designed specifically for premenstrual problems.\n\n– Stopping the pill because of side effects: Drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol may lead more people to stop taking the pill due to side effects. For every 100 people, about 3 might stop when taking a placebo. About 6 to 16 might stop when taking drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol.\n\n– Side effects overall: Drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol may cause more side effects than placebo. For every 100 people, about 28 might have side effects with a placebo. About 40 to 54 might have side effects with drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol. It probably causes more breast pain. It may cause more nausea, spotting between periods, and irregular bleeding. Its effect on nervousness, headaches, tiredness, and general pain is unclear. No rare but serious side effects, such as blood clots, were reported in these studies.\n\n– Feeling better overall (response to treatment): Drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol may increase the chance that people feel better overall compared with placebo. For every 100 people, about 36 might feel better with placebo. About 39 to 58 might feel better with the drospirenone pill.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because several studies did not clearly describe how they were done. Results varied between studies, and some studies were small. Most people in the studies had PMDD, so we do not know if the findings apply to milder PMS. We did not find any direct comparisons with other birth control pills. We also do not know whether benefits continue after about 3 menstrual cycles.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
