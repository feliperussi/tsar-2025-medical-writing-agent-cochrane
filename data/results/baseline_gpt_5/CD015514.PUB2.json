  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs face-down head positioning after eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy with a gas bubble) better than other positions for macula-involving retinal detachment (when the central part of the retina comes off)?\n\nKey Messages\n– Face-down positioning after this eye surgery may reduce retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning (holding your head so the gas bubble presses on the tear). Retinal displacement means the retina shifts slightly after surgery and can cause wavy vision (metamorphopsia) and double vision (binocular diplopia). Face-down positioning may also reduce outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the outer layer of the retina), but may raise eye pressure. We are not confident in these findings because they come from few, small studies.\n\n– We did not find clear differences in vision, visual distortion, or quality of life when comparing face-down with face-up or support-the-break positioning. Non-eye side effects were not reported.\n\n– Future studies should include more people, compare positions clearly, measure outcomes that matter to patients (comfort, daily activities, and quality of life), and report harms. Two ongoing studies may add useful information.\n\nWhat is macula-involving retinal detachment?\nThe retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of your eye. The macula is the central part that lets you see fine detail. In a macula-involving retinal detachment, the retina peels away and the macula is affected. This is an urgent problem and can cause serious vision loss.\n\nWhat is the surgery and why might head position matter?\nA common treatment is pars plana vitrectomy, an eye surgery to reattach the retina. The surgeon removes the eye’s gel (vitreous), repairs the tear, and places a gas bubble to hold the retina in place. After surgery, some doctors ask people to stay face-down so the bubble presses on the right area. Others ask people to position their head to “support the break,” which means placing the bubble over the tear based on its location. Head positioning after surgery might change how the retina settles and how vision recovers.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if face-down positioning after this surgery reduces retinal displacement. We also looked at vision, visual distortion, quality of life, and harms such as eye pressure and retinal folds.\n\nHow is macula-involving retinal detachment treated?\n– Pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to reattach the retina)\n– A gas bubble in the eye to hold the retina in place\n– Head positioning after surgery, such as face-down, face-up, or support-the-break\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for randomized studies (studies where people were placed into groups by chance) that compared different head positions after surgery with a gas bubble. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 randomized studies involving 368 people (369 eyes). Most people were men. Only one study reported race and ethnicity and funding. The studies compared face-down positioning with support-the-break positioning, or face-down with face-up positioning. Outcomes were measured around 3 months and 6 months after surgery. No studies reported non-eye side effects.\n\nMain results\n– Retinal displacement: Face-down positioning may reduce retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at about 6 months. We are not confident in this result because it comes mainly from one study.\n\n– Vision: It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on vision at about 3 months.\n\n– Visual distortion and quality of life: It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on visual distortion or quality of life at about 6 months.\n\n– Harms: Face-down positioning may reduce outer retinal folds and double vision compared with support-the-break positioning at about 6 months, but may increase raised eye pressure. Another small study did not find differences in retinal folds when comparing face-down and face-up at 1 to 3 months. Non-eye side effects were not reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there were only a few small studies and many results came from single studies. The studies did not report all outcomes we care about, such as non-eye side effects. Most people in the studies were men, and only one study reported race, ethnicity, and funding, which limits how well the findings apply to everyone. Studies used different head positions and follow-up times, which makes it harder to compare results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",
