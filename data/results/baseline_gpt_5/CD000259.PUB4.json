  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes audit and feedback (performance reports for healthcare professionals) help improve how care is delivered?\n\nKey Messages\n- Audit and feedback probably improves desired professional practices slightly, such as prescribing medicines and ordering tests the right way. Unwanted or harmful effects were not reported. The size of the benefit varies, and feedback is often given together with other supports, so it can be hard to tell how much of the change comes from feedback alone.\n- Feedback may work better when it shows each person’s own results (not just the team’s), compares care to top peers or a target (a “benchmark”), involves a trusted local champion (a colleague who supports the change), uses interactive formats (for example, written plus conversation), and includes help to engage with the feedback and a clear action plan.\n- We need more good‑quality studies to confirm which feedback designs work best, to measure possible unwanted effects and costs, and to study feedback in different healthcare settings, including low‑ and middle‑income countries.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback?\nAudit and feedback is a way to improve care. The “audit” part means measuring how healthcare professionals deliver care over a set time. The “feedback” part means giving them a report that shows how their care compares with a target or good practice.\n\nWhy might audit and feedback be used?\nHealthcare professionals are busy and may not notice small gaps in their day‑to‑day practice. Seeing clear results can prompt them to adjust how they prescribe medicines, order tests, or follow guidelines. Feedback can also point out high‑priority issues and help teams decide what to improve first.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if audit and feedback improves how healthcare professionals deliver care. We also wanted to learn which features of feedback make it more effective, such as how results are shown, who delivers the message, and whether action plans are included.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that measured the effects of audit and feedback on professional practice, compared with usual practice or other ways to support improvement. We summarized the results across studies and judged how much trust we can place in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 292 studies that included many types of healthcare professionals, most often physicians. The studies targeted a wide range of day‑to‑day practices. Prescribing medicines and ordering tests were the most common areas. Most studies gave feedback alongside other supports, such as education sessions and reminders.\n\nOnly a small share of studies took place in low‑ or middle‑income countries; most were in high‑income settings. Many interventions used several behavior change techniques. The feedback reports were delivered in different ways: written, verbal, or both; to individuals or to teams; and with different kinds of comparisons, such as to top peers or to average performance.\n\nAcross studies, audit and feedback probably increases the number of desired care actions slightly. In practical terms, for every 100 care actions, feedback may lead to a few more being done as intended. This small improvement was seen for both prescribing and test‑ordering.\n\nSome features were linked to bigger improvements. These include:\n- showing results for the individual professional rather than only for a team or organization;\n- comparing performance to top peers or a clear benchmark (a target level of performance);\n- involving a local champion who already has a relationship with the person receiving feedback;\n- using interactive formats (for example, combining written reports with a conversation);\n- providing help to engage with the feedback (facilitation);\n- including a specific action plan with steps to improve.\n\nFeatures that did not appear to help include comparing to the average of all peers and adding more indicators just for the sake of numbers. In this analysis, repeated feedback was linked to smaller improvements, which was unexpected. Direct comparisons in some studies supported using peer comparisons and designing feedback to highlight high‑priority items that need action.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were well done, but we have some concerns. Some studies had weaknesses in their methods, which could affect the results. Feedback was delivered in many different ways, making it hard to be sure which parts work best in all settings. Most studies took place in high‑income countries, so the results may not apply everywhere. Few studies reported unwanted effects, patient outcomes, or costs, so we cannot judge these important points.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2020.",
