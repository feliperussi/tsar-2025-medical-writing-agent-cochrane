  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhich treatments help with depression after stroke: medicines, brain stimulation, talking therapy, or combinations?\n\nKey Messages\n- We looked at medicines, non-invasive brain stimulation (gentle magnetic or electrical currents on the scalp), talking therapy (psychological therapy), and combinations of these. We are not confident about the results. Medicines may help with depression after stroke, but they were linked with more problems affecting the brain and nerves and the stomach and gut. Non-invasive brain stimulation alone may make little to no difference. Talking therapy may help, and adding brain stimulation to medicines may help, but we are very uncertain about all of these findings.\n- Many studies did not report all important outcomes. For example, some did not report whether people’s depression failed to improve enough, and some did not report unwanted effects. Some combinations had no studies that measured our main outcomes.\n- Future research needs to include larger groups of people, clear and consistent ways of measuring depression, good reporting of unwanted effects, and direct comparisons between treatments and combinations that matter to people after stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nA stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain stops. This can lead to long-term problems with movement, speech, thinking, and mood. Many people develop depression after stroke. Depression is a long-lasting low mood that makes daily life harder. It can slow recovery and reduce quality of life.\n\nWhy is treating depression after stroke important?\nDepression can make it harder to take part in rehabilitation and daily activities. Treating depression may help people feel better, take part in therapy, and recover more of their abilities.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of:\n- medicines for depression (often called antidepressants)\n- non-invasive brain stimulation (a treatment that uses weak magnetic or electrical currents on the scalp without surgery)\n- talking therapy (psychological therapy, such as structured counselling)\n- combinations of these treatments\n\nHow is depression after stroke treated?\nCommon options include:\n- medicines (antidepressants): medicines that change brain chemicals linked to mood\n- non-invasive brain stimulation: gentle magnetic or electrical currents on the scalp to influence brain activity\n- talking therapy (psychological therapy): structured sessions to learn skills and coping strategies\n- combinations of these treatments\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested these treatments in people after stroke, comparing them with look-alike pills with no active medicine (placebo), fake brain stimulation (sham), or usual care. We summarized the results and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that included 5831 people after stroke. The studies tested medicines, non-invasive brain stimulation, talking therapy, and some combinations. Some treatments were compared with placebo, sham stimulation, or usual care. For some combinations, we did not find studies that measured our main outcomes, and several studies did not report unwanted effects.\n\nMedicines versus placebo:\n- It is unclear if medicines reduce depression after stroke or increase the chance that treatment works well. The results suggest possible benefits, but we are not confident.\n- Medicines may increase problems affecting the brain and nerves, and the stomach and gut, compared with placebo. We are very uncertain about these results, but they suggest more unwanted effects with medicines.\n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation versus sham (fake) stimulation:\n- It may make little to no difference to depression after stroke. We are very uncertain about these results.\n- No deaths were reported in the studies we found.\n\nTalking therapy versus usual care or extra attention:\n- It is unclear if talking therapy reduces depression after stroke. The results suggest possible benefits, but we are not confident.\n- Studies did not report whether people’s depression failed to improve enough. Unwanted effects and deaths were similar to usual care in the studies that reported them.\n\nMedicines plus talking therapy:\n- We do not know if this combination helps with depression after stroke, because studies did not report our main outcomes. No deaths were reported.\n\nMedicines plus non-invasive brain stimulation versus medicines alone:\n- Adding brain stimulation to medicines may reduce depression at the end of treatment, compared with medicines alone. We are only a little confident in this result.\n- It is unclear if adding brain stimulation changes how many people fail to improve enough. Deaths did not seem different, but we are very uncertain about this.\n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation plus talking therapy:\n- We did not find studies that reported our main outcomes for this combination.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many findings because:\n- Some treatments were tested in only a few, small studies.\n- The studies used different types of treatments and measured depression in different ways.\n- Many studies did not report important outcomes, such as unwanted effects or whether depression failed to improve enough.\nBecause of these problems, the true effects could be bigger or smaller than the results suggest.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
