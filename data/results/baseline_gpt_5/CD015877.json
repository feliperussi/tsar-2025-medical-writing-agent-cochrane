  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo personalized diet plans (precision nutrition) help children and teens with overweight or obesity manage their weight?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if personalized diet plans (precision nutrition: diet advice tailored to a person’s body, habits, and health data) help children and teens with overweight or obesity lose weight compared with general, one-size-fits-all advice. The studies did not report any unwanted effects (harms), so we do not know if there are risks.\n- The available evidence is very limited. Only 2 small studies used a computer program to give personalized diet advice. These studies did not report results for well-being, mood, daily functioning, or physical activity.\n- Future research needs to include many more children and teens, follow them for longer, clearly report methods, and measure outcomes that matter to families, such as weight, health-related quality of life, mental and emotional health, physical activity, and any unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are overweight and obesity in children and teens, and why do they matter?\nOverweight and obesity mean a child has more body fat than is healthy for their age and height. This can affect health now and in the future. It can raise the chance of problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep problems, joint pain, and low mood. Many families want safe and effective ways to support healthy weight.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition?\nPrecision nutrition means giving diet advice that is tailored to each person. It looks at things like usual eating habits, health status, sleep and body clocks (circadian rhythms), physical activity, and sometimes personal biology, such as genes (information you inherit from your parents) or gut microbiome (the helpful bacteria in your gut). A computer program can combine these data and suggest a diet plan that fits the person, rather than giving the same advice to everyone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if precision nutrition helps children and teens with overweight or obesity manage their weight better than general advice or usual care. We also wanted to know how it affects well-being (mental and physical), daily functioning, physical activity, and any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared personalized diet approaches with general, one-size-fits-all advice or no program in children and teens with overweight or obesity. We summarized the results and judged how much we can trust the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 2 studies with a total of 105 children and teens. The studies took place in Ukraine and Greece. One study said it was funded by a nonprofit group; the other did not say how it was funded. Both studies used a computer-based decision support tool. This is a computer program that uses personal information to suggest a diet plan tailored to each child. The comparison group received general diet advice or standard care.\n\nThe studies included children aged 0 to 9 years and children and adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. Only 1 of the 2 studies reported results for our main outcomes. Results were reported at the end of the programs. The studies did not report results on well-being, physical activity, or disability. They also did not report any unwanted effects.\n\nMain results\n- Personalized diet plans versus general advice in children under 10:\nIt is unclear if personalized diet plans reduce body mass index (BMI; a measure that relates weight to height) or weight compared with general advice. We are very uncertain about these results.\n\n- Personalized diet plans versus general advice in children and teens aged 10 to 19:\nIt is unclear if personalized diet plans reduce or increase BMI or weight compared with general advice. We are very uncertain about these results.\n\n- Unwanted effects (harms):\nThe studies did not report unwanted effects, so we do not know if there are risks linked to personalized diet plans.\n\nBecause the studies were small and few, and because key information was missing, we cannot tell whether precision nutrition helps children and teens manage weight better than usual advice.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there were only 2 small studies, and one study did not report results for the main outcomes we cared about. The study methods were not always fully described, so it is hard to tell how well the studies were done. The studies took place in only two countries, and many important outcomes, such as mental and emotional well-being, quality of life, physical activity, and unwanted effects, were not reported. These limits mean the results may not apply to all children and teens, and we cannot be sure about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
