  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL, keyhole surgery through the skin) or retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS, a small camera passed up the urine tube to the kidney): which works better for kidney stones in adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- PCNL may remove all stones more often than RIRS and may reduce the need for a second procedure. PCNL probably makes little to no difference to serious medical problems compared with RIRS. PCNL may lead to a slightly longer stay in hospital. The studies did not report unplanned medical visits or how people felt and functioned after treatment (quality of life).\n- The results mostly come from small studies, and many gave limited details. This means we cannot be fully sure about the size of the benefits and harms, or who they apply to best (for example, different stone sizes).\n- Future research should include larger, well-reported studies that track outcomes people care about, such as pain, recovery time, unplanned medical visits, quality of life, and the need for further procedures. Studies should also report funding and compare different sizes of PCNL instruments.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why do they matter?\nKidney stones are hard lumps that form in the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infection. Some small stones pass on their own. Larger or hard-to-reach stones often need treatment to remove or break them.\n\nWhat are PCNL and RIRS?\nPCNL is “keyhole” surgery done through a small cut in the skin of the back to reach the kidney and remove stones. RIRS uses a thin scope with a camera passed through the body’s urine pathway (through the urethra and bladder, up the ureter to the kidney) to see and treat stones from inside. Doctors may use laser to break stones during RIRS.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which procedure works better for adults with kidney stones: PCNL or RIRS. We compared:\n- How many people had no stones left after treatment (stone-free rate).\n- Serious medical problems (major complications).\n- The need for another procedure.\nWe also looked for unplanned medical visits, length of hospital stay, injury or narrowing of the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder), and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that directly compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. We summarized what the studies found and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 adults with kidney stones. The average stone size across studies ranged from about 10 mm to about 39 mm. Twenty-two studies were full papers, and 20 were conference abstracts. Most studies did not say who funded them or whether there were conflicts of interest. Many PCNL procedures used smaller-sized instruments rather than standard larger ones. The studies rarely reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nMain results\n- Stone-free rate (no stones left after treatment): PCNL may improve stone-free rates compared with RIRS. For example, if 77 out of 100 people are stone-free after RIRS, then about 87 out of 100 may be stone-free after PCNL.\n- Major complications (serious medical problems): PCNL probably makes little to no difference to major complications compared with RIRS. The chance of a serious problem appears about the same with both procedures.\n- Need for a second procedure: PCNL may reduce the need for a second procedure compared with RIRS. For every 100 people, about 22 may need a second procedure after RIRS. With PCNL, about 15 fewer out of 100 may need a second procedure.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may lead to a slightly longer stay in hospital than RIRS, by about 1 extra day on average.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury (narrowing or damage to the urine tube): PCNL may make little to no difference compared with RIRS. These events were uncommon and rates were similar between groups.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No studies reported these outcomes, so we do not know how PCNL and RIRS compare for these aspects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in most of these findings because many studies were small and gave limited details. Results varied across studies, and many did not report all outcomes we care about, such as unplanned medical visits and quality of life. Most studies did not report who funded the research or any conflicts of interest. In addition, people and their doctors likely knew which procedure they received, which can affect how outcomes are reported.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
