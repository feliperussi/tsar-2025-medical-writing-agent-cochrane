  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo brief counseling and support (psychosocial interventions) or medicines help people stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\nKey Messages\n- Brief counseling and support may help more pregnant women stop drinking alcohol completely during pregnancy, compared with usual care (such as an alcohol check and advice to stop). It is unclear whether these sessions change how much people drink if they continue to drink. The studies did not report any unwanted effects or harms from the counseling.\n- We did not find any studies that tested medicines to help people stop or reduce alcohol use during pregnancy.\n- Future research should test both counseling and medicines, report any harms, and use clear, consistent ways to measure alcohol use. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to answer all important questions, especially for women with alcohol use disorder (serious, hard-to-control drinking).\n\nWhy is alcohol use in pregnancy a concern?\nAlcohol use in pregnancy can harm a developing baby. It can lead to health and learning problems for the child. Alcohol use during pregnancy happens in many countries. This review looked at ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce alcohol use.\n\nWhat support or treatments might help?\nSupport can include brief counseling and motivational conversations. These are short, focused talks that help people think about their drinking and plan changes. These are called psychosocial interventions. Some people also ask about medicines that might help, but the safety of medicines in pregnancy needs careful study.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out:\n- If brief counseling and support help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol or drink less\n- If medicines help, and whether counseling or medicines cause any harms\n- Whether people stay in treatment\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to January 2024 that compared counseling or medicines with usual care, no extra help, a placebo (a dummy treatment), or another type of counseling. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with 1369 pregnant women. Six studies took place in the USA, 1 in Spain, and 1 in the Netherlands. In one study, almost half of the women had alcohol use disorder (AUD), which means serious drinking that is hard to control and causes problems. In another study, many had a past history of AUD.\n\nAll 8 studies tested brief counseling and support. Most programs were short. Some were a single session lasting 10 to 60 minutes. Others had up to five sessions of about 10 minutes each. Most women received the counseling near the end of the first trimester (the first 3 months of pregnancy). The studies checked drinking again 8 to 24 weeks later. The comparison groups usually received usual care, such as an alcohol assessment and advice to stop drinking during pregnancy.\n\nWe did not find any studies that tested medicines to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking.\n\nMain results\n- Stopping alcohol completely: Brief counseling and support may increase the number of people who stop drinking throughout pregnancy, compared with usual care.\n- How much people drink if they continue: It is unclear if brief counseling and support change the number of drinks per day among those who keep drinking. The results vary and we are very uncertain.\n- Staying in treatment: Brief counseling and support probably make little to no difference to whether people finish the treatment program, compared with usual care.\n- Unwanted effects (harms): The studies did not report harms from the counseling. We do not know if there are any unwanted effects because they were not measured or reported.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for you?\nShort counseling sessions may help more pregnant women stop alcohol completely, compared with usual care. We do not know if these sessions change how much people drink if they continue to drink. No studies tested medicines during pregnancy, so we do not know if any medicines help or are safe for this purpose. The studies did not report harms from counseling.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some findings and only moderate confidence in others because:\n- People in the studies likely knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect results.\n- Many studies were small, and there were not enough studies to be sure about some outcomes.\n- The counseling sessions and the people taking part differed across studies, which can lead to mixed results.\n- The studies did not report harms, so we cannot judge safety.\n- Measures of alcohol use were not always consistent, making studies hard to compare.\n\nWhat research is still needed?\nFuture studies should:\n- Test both brief counseling and medicines during pregnancy, and carefully report any harms\n- Include women with alcohol use disorder and report results for them\n- Use clear, consistent measures of alcohol use, such as drinks per drinking day\n- Report important related conditions, like anxiety, depression, and use of other substances\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
