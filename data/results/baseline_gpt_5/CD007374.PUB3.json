They may also improve knowledge about diabetes and some self‑care in the short term, and may reduce “bad” cholesterol (LDL). We do not know if education programs affect deaths, severe low blood sugar (serious hypoglycaemia), or kidney failure because these results were too limited. Harms were not well reported.\n- In people with more advanced kidney damage from type 2 diabetes who also received coordinated team care (a team of different health professionals working together), adding an education program may make little to no difference to blood sugar, kidney measures, blood pressure, or cholesterol. These results are uncertain.\n- The studies were small and measured different things. We need larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer and report results that matter to patients, such as kidney function, very low blood sugar events, quality of life, and any unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why does education matter?\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long‑lasting condition where the kidneys are damaged and do not filter blood well. Diabetes is a long‑lasting condition where the body cannot control blood sugar. Many people have both conditions. Managing both is hard and often involves many daily tasks, such as taking medicines, checking blood sugar, following a diet, and being active.\n\nEducation programs are sessions where a trained health worker (for example, a nurse, pharmacist, diabetes educator, or doctor) teaches people about their condition and how to care for themselves. Teaching can be in person, on paper, by audio, or using a computer. The goal is to help people understand their health and build skills and confidence to manage it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education programs help adults with CKD and diabetes. We looked for benefits (such as better blood sugar, cholesterol, kidney health, and knowledge) and harms (such as severe low blood sugar). We also wanted to know if any effects last over time.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared education programs with routine care. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in them, based on how the studies were done and how big they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with 840 adults who had both CKD and diabetes. People received education from health professionals in different ways. Most comparisons were education programs plus routine care versus routine care alone. One study looked at education added to coordinated team care. Follow‑up times ranged from 5 weeks to about 18 months. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Blood sugar: Education programs probably reduce HbA1c (a blood test that shows average blood sugar over 2 to 3 months). This means education likely helps people lower their long‑term blood sugar.\n- Cholesterol: Education programs may reduce total cholesterol and “bad” cholesterol (LDL). We are not sure about the size of these effects.\n- Knowledge and confidence: In people on dialysis (a treatment that filters the blood when kidneys fail), an education program may improve knowledge about diabetes, including diet, medicines like insulin, low and high blood sugar, exercise, long‑term complications, and coping with stress. In people with diabetes and a moderate amount of protein in the urine (albuminuria, which means protein leaking into urine), education may improve general diabetes knowledge and confidence (self‑efficacy, meaning how sure you feel about managing your health), at least in the short term.\n- Self‑care behaviors: One study found that education may improve healthy eating and home blood sugar checks at the end of the program. However, by 3 months later, there may be no difference.\n- Kidney and heart‑related outcomes: We do not know if education changes kidney failure, because the evidence was too limited. There were no data on many kidney measures (such as creatinine clearance or protein in the urine) in most studies. We also lack results for quality of life and heart disease events.\n- Harms and serious events: We do not know if education changes deaths or severe low blood sugar. These outcomes were reported too little to draw conclusions.\n- Education added to coordinated team care: In people with advanced kidney damage from type 2 diabetes, adding education to coordinated team care may make little to no difference to HbA1c, kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate), blood pressure, or cholesterol. We are uncertain about these findings. There were no results for deaths, quality of life, many kidney measures, heart problems, or unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that education lowers HbA1c, but our confidence for most other outcomes is limited. Many studies were small and followed people for a short time. Some results came from questionnaires, which can be influenced by what people expect. In several studies, people likely knew which program they received, which can affect answers. Not all studies reported the outcomes we care about, such as kidney failure, severe low blood sugar, or quality of life. Because of these issues, we are not sure about the effects on many important outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
