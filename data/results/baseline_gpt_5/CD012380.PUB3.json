Hydroxyurea (a medicine used in sickle cell disease) may improve how well very young children can concentrate their urine, but its effects on kidney filtering function are unclear. ACE inhibitors (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors – blood pressure medicines that can protect kidneys) may or may not reduce protein in pee. Harmful effects were poorly reported. No deaths were reported in the studies we looked at.\n– The studies were small and focused on specific groups, such as infants, children, or adults with normal blood pressure and small amounts of protein in pee. No studies tested red blood cell transfusions or combinations of treatments. Quality of life was not reported.\n– We need more good‑quality, longer studies that include older children and adults. Future research should test hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, and should report outcomes that matter to people, including unwanted effects, hospital stays, and quality of life.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why can it affect the kidneys?\nSickle cell disease is an inherited blood condition. It happens when a person receives two changed haemoglobin genes. It can cause severe pain, lung problems, organ damage, and early death.\n\nKidney problems are common in people with sickle cell disease. Chronic kidney disease means the kidneys do not work normally for more than 3 months. In sickle cell disease, early kidney damage can show up as small amounts of protein in pee (called microalbuminuria). This can lead to larger amounts of protein in pee (proteinuria) and ongoing kidney problems over time.\n\nWhat treatments might help protect the kidneys?\nPossible options include:\n– hydroxyurea (a medicine that helps reduce pain episodes and may protect organs)\n– ACE inhibitors (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors – blood pressure medicines that can also protect kidneys), such as captopril or lisinopril\n– red blood cell transfusions\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or red blood cell transfusions can prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease. We also wanted to know about unwanted effects, hospital stays, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments with a dummy pill (placebo), with each other, or with no treatment. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with 385 people. One study included very young children (aged 9 to 18 months) and compared hydroxyurea with placebo. One study included adults with normal blood pressure and small amounts of protein in pee, and compared captopril (an ACE inhibitor) with placebo. One study included children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and small amounts of protein in pee, and compared lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) with vitamin C. One study lasted 6 months; the length of the others was not clear from the abstract. The abstract did not mention who funded the studies. No study tested red blood cell transfusions or combinations of treatments.\n\nMain results:\n– Hydroxyurea versus placebo in very young children: We do not know if hydroxyurea affects how well the kidneys filter blood (measured by glomerular filtration rate – how well the kidneys clean the blood). Hydroxyurea may improve the child’s ability to concentrate urine. Hydroxyurea may make little to no difference to serious sickle cell problems such as acute chest syndrome (a serious lung problem), painful crises (pain episodes), or hospital stays. No deaths occurred. The study did not report quality of life.\n– ACE inhibitor (captopril) versus placebo in adults: We do not know if captopril reduces protein in pee or protects kidney function (measured by creatinine clearance – how well the kidneys remove waste). The study did not report serious unwanted effects, deaths, or quality of life.\n– ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) versus vitamin C in children: The results were unclear and the study did not provide usable data. We do not know if lisinopril reduces protein in pee. Both groups showed a quick drop in small amounts of protein in pee, which may have been due to how baseline measurements were taken. The study did not report serious unwanted effects, deaths, or quality of life.\n\nNo studies assessed red blood cell transfusions or combined treatments to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because the studies were small, and they focused on specific groups rather than all people with sickle cell disease. Some results were unclear or not reported, including serious unwanted effects and quality of life. It is also possible that people knew which treatment they were getting. In one study, results may have been affected by how protein in pee was measured at the start. We also need longer follow‑up, because kidney problems develop over time.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2020.",
