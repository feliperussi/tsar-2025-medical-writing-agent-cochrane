  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhich dressings or securement devices work best to prevent problems with arterial lines (thin tubes in an artery)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find clear evidence that any one dressing or securement device works better than another to stop arterial lines failing or to prevent blood infections linked to the line. Infections were rare and sometimes not reported. Unwanted effects were few and not well described.\n- Dressings with a sticky border, and dressings with a built-in holder, may make little or no difference compared with standard clear film dressings. Adding medical glue (tissue adhesive) or using a sutureless holder may or may not help; the evidence is unclear.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence. Future studies should be larger, use the same outcome measures, and report infections and other unwanted effects clearly.\n\nWhat are arterial lines and why are they used?\nArterial lines (also called peripheral arterial catheters) are thin tubes placed in an artery. They are used in operating rooms during anaesthesia and in intensive care to take blood samples and to watch blood pressure beat by beat. These lines can stop working or come out, which means the line has to be put in again. Lines can also cause infections in the blood.\n\nWhy might dressings and securement devices matter?\nDressings are coverings placed over the line where it goes into the skin. Securement devices are holders that keep the line steady. These products aim to protect the site, keep the line working, and reduce problems like dislodgement (the line moves or comes out), blockage (occlusion), and bloodstream infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if certain dressings or securement devices reduce line failure, dislodgement, blockage, and infections, compared with other products used in hospital.\n\nWhat products are used to keep arterial lines in place?\n- Standard clear film dressing made of plastic (standard polyurethane or SPU)\n- Clear film dressing with a sticky border (bordered polyurethane or BPU)\n- Medical glue used under a clear film dressing (tissue adhesive)\n- Sutureless securement devices (holders that keep the line in place without stitches)\n- Integrated securement dressings (dressings that include a built-in holder)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different dressings and securement devices for arterial lines. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies with 1228 people who had arterial lines in hospital. The studies compared:\n- Standard clear film plus medical glue versus standard clear film alone\n- Clear film with a sticky border versus standard clear film\n- Standard clear film plus a sutureless holder versus standard clear film\n- Integrated securement dressings versus standard clear film\n\nPeople were in hospital settings such as anaesthesia and intensive care. The studies did not clearly describe how long people were followed or who funded the research.\n\nMain results\n- Standard clear film plus medical glue versus standard clear film: It is unclear if adding medical glue reduces line failure, dislodgement, or blockage. Blood infections linked to the line were not reported in these studies. Unwanted effects were rare and not well described.\n- Clear film with a sticky border versus standard clear film: This option may make little or no difference to blood infections, dislodgement, or blockage. It is unclear if it reduces line failure or unwanted effects.\n- Standard clear film plus a sutureless holder versus standard clear film: It is unclear if adding a sutureless holder reduces line failure, dislodgement, blockage, blood infections, or unwanted effects.\n- Integrated securement dressings versus standard clear film: These dressings may make little or no difference to line failure, dislodgement, blockage, blood infections, or unwanted effects.\n\nAcross all products, we did not see clear differences in how often lines failed or how often infections or other unwanted effects happened. Infections were rare or not reported. When infections did occur, there were too few events to be sure about any differences.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were small and there were few infections or other events to learn from. The studies also measured outcomes in different ways, which makes them hard to compare. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which product they received, and not all studies reported everything we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",
