When oestrogen was used with a vaginal pessary (a device placed in the vagina to support pelvic organs), it may lead to fewer vaginal problems compared with using a pessary alone. When oestrogen was used around the time of surgery, it may lower urinary tract infections (UTIs; infections of the bladder and nearby tubes) after surgery compared with surgery alone. Unwanted effects were not well reported.\n- No studies tested oestrogen therapy by itself against no treatment, placebo (dummy treatment), pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles), pessaries, or surgery. We also found very little information about costs or value for money.\n- Larger, better-designed studies are needed. Future research should test oestrogen therapy used alone and together with pelvic floor muscle training, pessaries, or surgery. Studies should follow people for longer, clearly measure benefits and harms, and report costs.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) happens when a woman’s uterus, bladder, or rectum drops down and bulges into the vagina. It can cause a feeling of pressure or heaviness, a vaginal bulge, and problems with passing urine or bowel movements.\n\nPOP is more common after menopause (when periods have stopped). Getting older, having had more births, and having a higher body weight can raise the risk.\n\nWhat treatments are used for POP?\nPeople may try:\n- pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the pelvic organs)\n- vaginal pessaries (devices placed in the vagina to support the organs)\n- surgery to repair and support the pelvic organs\nSome doctors also use oestrogen therapy. Oestrogen is a female hormone. It can be given as a cream, tablet, or ring placed in the vagina (topical oestrogen), or as pills or patches (systemic oestrogen) that affect the whole body.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy for POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. We looked at oestrogen used alone and oestrogen used together with other treatments. We also looked for information about costs and value for money.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies in postmenopausal women with POP that compared oestrogen therapy, alone or with other treatments, against no treatment, placebo, or other options. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that included 1002 women. Most studies tested oestrogen therapy used together with another treatment. Three studies compared topical oestrogen plus a vaginal pessary versus a pessary alone. Eleven studies compared topical oestrogen used around the time of surgery versus surgery alone. We did not find any studies that tested oestrogen therapy by itself against no treatment, placebo, pelvic floor muscle training, a pessary, or surgery.\n\nThe studies varied in how they were done. In many studies, people likely knew which treatment they were getting. Important outcomes were not always reported, and results were often short-term. The abstract did not report who funded the studies or where they were done.\n\nMain results\n- Oestrogen therapy on its own: It is unclear if oestrogen therapy has any effect on prolapse symptoms because no studies tested oestrogen alone against common alternatives.\n- Oestrogen plus a vaginal pessary: Topical oestrogen may reduce vaginal problems, such as irritation or discomfort, compared with using a pessary alone. We have limited confidence in this finding because the studies were small and used different methods.\n- Oestrogen plus surgery: Topical oestrogen used around the time of surgery may reduce UTIs after surgery compared with surgery alone. We have limited confidence in this finding for the same reasons.\n\nWe did not find enough reliable information about unwanted effects in general or about costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small and people may have known which treatment they were getting. Important outcomes were not always reported, and the studies used different methods and measures. We also lacked studies of oestrogen therapy used alone against common treatments, and most studies did not follow people for the medium or long term.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
