  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo routine antibiotics before uterine evacuation (removing pregnancy tissue from the womb) for miscarriage help prevent infection?\n\nKey Messages\n- Overall, giving antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections) before the procedure may reduce womb (uterus) infections, but we are not very confident in this. In the larger, better-run studies that included most people, antibiotics caused a big drop in infections. Side effects were uncommon: vomiting and diarrhea were about the same with or without antibiotics; allergies may be more likely but were rare, and no life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) were reported. These findings apply to people having a procedure for miscarriage who do not have signs of infection.\n- We are very uncertain whether antibiotics before the procedure reduce later hospital stays for infection or reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics to treat infection.\n- Future studies should report side effects carefully, follow people up well, check that people take the medicines as planned, and look at different antibiotics and doses. Research should also consider antibiotic resistance (when antibiotics no longer work well) and costs.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is miscarriage and how is it managed?\nMiscarriage (early pregnancy loss) is when a pregnancy ends on its own in the first months. Sometimes, a procedure is needed to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb. This is called uterine evacuation. It helps prevent heavy bleeding and infection and can help the body recover.\n\nWhat are prophylactic antibiotics and why might they be used?\nProphylactic antibiotics are antibiotics given to prevent infection, not to treat an infection that is already present. Some people who have clear signs of infection need antibiotics for treatment. But for people without signs of infection, it is less clear if giving antibiotics before the procedure helps prevent infection afterwards.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving prophylactic antibiotics before uterine evacuation for miscarriage prevents womb infections. We also wanted to learn about unwanted effects, like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and allergies, and whether antibiotics lower the need for later treatment or hospital care for infection.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving antibiotics before the procedure with giving a dummy tablet (placebo) or no antibiotics in people without signs of infection. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings, based on how the studies were done and how complete their data were.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 6 studies, including 4371 people having a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue after miscarriage. The studies compared routine antibiotics given before or around the time of the procedure with placebo or no antibiotics. People who already had signs of infection were not included. There was no limit on pregnancy age. Only one large study reported side effects in detail. The abstract did not report who funded the studies or how long they followed people after the procedure.\n\nMain results\n- Womb infection after the procedure: Looking at all 6 studies together, antibiotics may make little to no difference to womb infections, and the results were uncertain. However, when we looked only at the larger, better-run studies that included most of the people, antibiotics cause a large reduction in womb infections. In other words, in those better-quality studies, fewer people got infections when they received antibiotics before the procedure.\n\n- Side effects: Based on one large study, antibiotics probably make little to no difference to vomiting and diarrhea. Antibiotics may increase the chance of allergic reactions, but these were rare, and the evidence was limited. No cases of anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) were reported.\n\n- Later treatment and hospital care: Antibiotics before the procedure may reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics to treat infection, and may reduce hospital stays for infection, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the results because many people did not return for follow-up visits, and many did not take antibiotics exactly as planned. Only one study reported side effects in detail, so we may be missing important information about harms. For some outcomes, there were few studies, so the results could change if more good-quality studies become available.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
