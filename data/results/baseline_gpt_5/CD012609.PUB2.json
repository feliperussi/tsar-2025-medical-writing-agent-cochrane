Infliximab taken together with purine analogue medicines (such as azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine) probably prevents flare‑ups better than purine analogues alone. We do not know enough about side effects and serious harms because the evidence for these was very uncertain.\n- Infliximab and infliximab “biosimilars” (near‑copies of the original biologic checked to be very similar) may work about the same to prevent flare‑ups. Infliximab may lead to more people losing benefit over time and stopping treatment because of side effects, but the evidence for this is not strong.\n- Future studies should compare infliximab with other active medicines, include enough people to give clear answers, and report side effects and serious harms in a consistent way.\n\nWhat is Crohn’s disease and why does remission matter?\nCrohn’s disease is a long‑lasting condition where parts of the gut get inflamed. People can have belly pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and tiredness. Symptoms can come and go. When symptoms are under control, we call this “remission.” Keeping remission matters because flare‑ups can damage the gut and affect daily life.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how might it help?\nInfliximab is a biologic medicine. It is a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein) that blocks tumor necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑alpha), a body chemical that drives inflammation. By blocking TNF‑alpha, infliximab aims to calm gut inflammation and help keep remission.\n\nOther medicines used include:\n- purine analogues (azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine), tablets that help the immune system settle down\n- other anti‑TNF biologics, such as adalimumab\n- biosimilars of infliximab (near‑copies that work in the same way)\n- different ways to give these medicines, for example under the skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous)\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if infliximab keeps people with Crohn’s disease in remission and how it compares with:\n- placebo (a dummy treatment)\n- purine analogues alone\n- infliximab biosimilars\n- adalimumab\n- different ways of giving biosimilars (under the skin vs into a vein)\nWe also wanted to know about side effects, serious harms, and people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with the options above in adults with Crohn’s disease. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in them based on study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies with 1257 adults, done between 1999 and 2022. Ages ranged from 18 to 69 years. Some studies included people who had never used a biologic before; others included a mix. Some people were in remission when they started; others had low or mixed disease activity. One study focused on people with fistulas (abnormal tunnels) related to Crohn’s. Most studies were done across many hospitals. All studies allowed people to keep taking some other medicines. Four studies were funded by drug companies, two had mixed funding, and two had public funding.\n\nMain results\n- Infliximab versus placebo: Infliximab probably reduces the chance of flare‑ups compared with placebo in people with mixed levels of disease activity at the start. We do not know if infliximab changes how often people lose benefit over time, stop because of side effects, or have serious harms, because the evidence for these outcomes was very uncertain.\n\n- Infliximab plus purine analogues versus purine analogues alone: Taking infliximab together with a purine analogue probably reduces flare‑ups compared with taking a purine analogue alone in people who were in remission. It also probably reduces signs of relapse seen on a camera test of the bowel (endoscopy). We do not know if this combination changes stopping due to side effects or serious harms, because the evidence was very uncertain.\n\n- Infliximab versus infliximab biosimilars: In people with mixed or low disease activity at the start, infliximab and its biosimilars may make little to no difference to preventing flare‑ups. Infliximab may lead to more people losing benefit over time and more people stopping because of side effects. Serious harms may be similar. These findings are based on limited evidence, so they could change with better studies.\n\n- Subcutaneous (under the skin) biosimilar versus intravenous (into a vein) biosimilar: We do not know if there are differences in flare‑ups, losing benefit, or stopping because of side effects. The evidence was very uncertain.\n\n- Infliximab versus adalimumab: We do not know whether one is better than the other for keeping benefit, stopping due to side effects, or serious harms. The evidence was very uncertain, and there was no clear information about flare‑ups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident that infliximab, alone and with a purine analogue, helps prevent flare‑ups compared with placebo or a purine analogue alone. Our confidence is only moderate because some studies were small and their methods were not always fully reported. We have little confidence in the findings about side effects and about comparisons with biosimilars, adalimumab, and different ways of giving biosimilars. There were few studies, small numbers of people, missing information, and in some cases people and their doctors may have known which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
