IVM increases the chance of miscarriage after a heartbeat is seen on an early scan (clinical pregnancy). IVM also greatly reduces the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a dangerous reaction to fertility medicines.\n- IVM probably makes little to no difference to preterm birth (babies born before 37 weeks). We do not know if IVM changes the chance of birth defects because the evidence is limited.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to answer all important questions. Future research should compare IVM with standard IVF/ICSI using clear methods, follow people long enough to track birth outcomes, and report harms and other outcomes that matter to families.\n\nWhat is PCOS and why can it make pregnancy hard?\nPCOS means polycystic ovary syndrome. It is a long-lasting condition that affects hormones and ovulation (egg release). Many women with PCOS have irregular periods and may not release an egg each month. This can make it hard to get pregnant without help.\n\nHow is assisted reproduction used for PCOS?\nAssisted reproduction includes in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where eggs are collected and mixed with sperm in a lab, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), where a single sperm is injected into an egg. To collect eggs for IVF/ICSI, people take medicines to grow many follicles in the ovaries. These strong medicines can sometimes cause OHSS (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome), which can make you feel very unwell and, in rare cases, be dangerous.\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation (IVM)?\nWith IVM, doctors collect eggs earlier than usual, while they are still immature. The eggs then finish maturing in the lab. The aim is to use fewer strong fertility medicines. This may lower the risk of OHSS. Some studies used “capacitation IVM,” a newer 2-step lab method designed to improve egg development.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether IVM, followed by IVF or ICSI, works as well as standard IVF/ICSI for women with PCOS. We looked at benefits (live birth and pregnancy) and unwanted effects (miscarriage, OHSS, preterm birth, and birth defects).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared IVM with standard IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we can have in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that involved 810 women with PCOS using assisted reproduction. Two newer studies used careful methods; two older studies were conference abstracts with less detail. Most results focused on IVF using a medicine plan called a “GnRH antagonist protocol” (medicines that help stop eggs from releasing too early).\n\nMain results:\n- Live birth: It is unclear if IVM has an effect on live birth compared with standard IVF/ICSI.\n- Becoming pregnant (clinical pregnancy, meaning a heartbeat seen on early ultrasound): It is unclear if IVM has an effect on clinical pregnancy compared with standard IVF/ICSI.\n- Miscarriage after a clinical pregnancy: IVM increases miscarriage compared with standard IVF/ICSI. For every 100 clinical pregnancies with standard IVF, about 20 might end in miscarriage. With IVM, about 20 to 40 might end in miscarriage.\n- Moderate or severe OHSS: IVM causes a large reduction in moderate or severe OHSS compared with standard IVF/ICSI. For every 100 women having standard IVF, about 3 or 4 might get moderate or severe OHSS. With IVM, about 0 to 2 might get it.\n- Preterm birth: IVM probably makes little to no difference to preterm birth compared with standard IVF/ICSI.\n- Birth defects (congenital anomalies): It is unclear if IVM has an effect on birth defects because there were few events and limited data.\n\nThe studies did not report results for cycle cancellation or how well eggs fertilized. Funding information and how long people were followed were not detailed in the abstract.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies across outcomes. We are confident that IVM reduces moderate or severe OHSS and increases miscarriage after a clinical pregnancy. We have little confidence about the effect on live birth and clinical pregnancy because there are few well-reported studies, some studies were small or only conference abstracts, and the studies used different lab methods and medicine plans. Not all important outcomes were reported, and there were few cases of birth defects, which makes those results uncertain.\n\n[Optional] How is PCOS-related infertility treated?\nTreatment options may include:\n- lifestyle changes and weight management\n- medicines to trigger ovulation\n- standard IVF or ICSI (collecting mature eggs after fertility medicines)\n- IVM (collecting immature eggs early and maturing them in the lab to reduce medicine use)\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
