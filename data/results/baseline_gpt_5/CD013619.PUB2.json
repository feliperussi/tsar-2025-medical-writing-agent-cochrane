We did not find clear evidence of harms to patient care or to staff, but the studies were too few and small to be sure.\n- It is unclear whether family presence changes patient survival, causes medical problems, affects how long resuscitation lasts, or increases personal stress for healthcare staff. One study found no differences in these areas.\n- We need larger, well‑designed studies in different settings that measure what matters to families, patients, and staff, including benefits, unwanted effects, and how best to offer support to relatives at the scene.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is resuscitation and what does “family presence” mean?\nResuscitation is emergency, life‑saving care. It includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which means chest compressions, rescue breaths, and other actions to try to restart the heart or breathing. Family presence means that a relative is offered the choice to be nearby during this care.\n\nWhy might family presence matter?\nSome people feel that being present helps them understand what happened and say goodbye. It may help with grief and coping after a very frightening event. Staff sometimes worry that having family present could crowd the space, distract the team, or increase stress. Because this affects relatives, patients, and healthcare staff, it is important to understand the possible benefits and harms for everyone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation helps them cope after the event. We focused on symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a mental health problem that can happen after a very upsetting event. Symptoms can include strong fear, bad dreams, and upsetting memories. We also looked at anxiety, depression, and complicated grief (long‑lasting, intense grief that makes daily life hard). We wanted to see if family presence affects patient outcomes, such as survival, and whether it changes medical care or personal stress for healthcare staff.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared offering family presence during resuscitation with not offering it. We summarized the results across the studies and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 2 studies with a total of 595 people. One study took place in France in the ambulance service. The other was a smaller pilot study in an emergency department in the UK. People in the studies were 19 to 78 years old. Between 56% and 64% were women. The studies included relatives, patients, and healthcare staff. The larger study followed relatives for 3 and 12 months after the event. PTSD symptoms were measured with a questionnaire used for traumatic events. The studies also looked at anxiety, depression, complicated grief, how long the resuscitation lasted, and personal stress for healthcare staff. The abstract did not report who funded the studies.\n\nMain results\n- Relatives’ mental health after resuscitation: One larger study suggested that offering family presence may reduce PTSD‑related symptoms, and may also reduce anxiety, depression, and complicated grief after 1 year. However, across the 2 studies, it is unclear if offering family presence reduces these problems. The studies were few and small, and we are very uncertain about the results.\n- Patient outcomes: It is unclear if offering family presence changes patient survival or causes medical problems. The studies did not provide enough information to answer this.\n- Medical care and staff well‑being: It is unclear if family presence changes how long resuscitation lasts or increases personal stress for healthcare staff. One study found little to no difference between groups, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for real people?\nSome relatives may feel better supported if they can choose to be present during resuscitation. The available research hints at possible benefits for coping, but it is not strong enough to be sure. We did not see clear signs that family presence harms patient care or increases staff stress, but there is not enough reliable information to rule out harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there were only 2 studies, and one was very small. The methods used in the studies make the results less reliable. For example, people and staff likely knew whether family members were present, which could affect how they answered questions later. The studies were done in different settings (ambulance and hospital), and not all outcomes we cared about were measured or reported. Because of these issues, the results could change if better studies are done.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
