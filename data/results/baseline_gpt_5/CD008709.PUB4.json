Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably lead to less long‑term pain and a similar chance of mesh problems and trouble emptying the bladder. We do not know the long‑term safety or the need for repeat surgery. Some harmful effects were not reported for some comparisons (for example, painful sex and pain after 2 years with retropubic slings).\n- We found only a few studies about costs, so we cannot say which option costs less overall or gives better value for money.\n- Future research should follow people for longer, report all harms in the same way, compare single‑incision slings with non‑surgical care and other operations, and include outcomes that matter to women.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence?\nStress urinary incontinence means leaking urine during coughing, laughing, sneezing, lifting, or exercise. It is common and can affect daily life, work, and well‑being. Many countries now have rules that limit the use of mesh in women’s pelvic surgery.\n\nWhat are single‑incision slings?\nA single‑incision sling is a short tape made of synthetic mesh. The surgeon places it through one small cut in the front wall of the vagina to support the middle of the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). The aim is to stop leakage by giving the urethra extra support. Other sling types include retropubic slings (the tape goes behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (the tape goes through the groin). Another option is an autologous fascial sling, which uses a strip of your own tissue instead of mesh.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if single‑incision slings work to stop or improve urine leakage in women, and how safe they are. We also looked for studies that compared costs and value for money.\n\n[Optional] How is stress urinary incontinence treated?\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (regular exercises to strengthen the muscles)\n- Lifestyle changes (for example, weight loss, less caffeine)\n- Devices such as vaginal pessaries\n- Surgery, such as different types of slings, colposuspension (lifting the neck of the bladder), or injections around the urethra\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single‑incision slings with other treatments in women with stress urinary incontinence. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 62 studies with 8051 women. Most studies compared single‑incision slings with other sling types. We found no studies that compared single‑incision slings with no treatment, non‑surgical care such as pelvic floor muscle training, colposuspension, or keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery. Many studies measured results at about 12 months; some also reported outcomes 24 months or later. Sixteen studies used a product called TVT‑Secur, which has been withdrawn. We left these out of the main results; adding them did not change the overall message. We found 2 cost‑effectiveness studies and 1 cost‑minimization study.\n\nSingle‑incision sling versus autologous fascial sling (your own tissue)\n- We do not know if single‑incision slings change the risk of painful sex or mesh problems compared with autologous fascial slings. Many important outcomes, like leakage control after 1 year, quality of life, pain after 2 years, need for repeat surgery, and trouble emptying the bladder, were not reported.\n\nSingle‑incision sling versus retropubic sling\n- Leakage control after 1 year: Single‑incision slings may make little to no difference compared with retropubic slings.\n- Mesh problems (mesh showing through or wearing through tissue): It is unclear if there is any difference.\n- Trouble emptying the bladder after surgery (urinary retention): It is unclear if there is any difference.\n- Need for repeat surgery or sling revision: We do not know if there is any difference.\n- Quality of life: One study reported it in a way we could not use.\n- Pain after 2 years and painful sex were not reported for this comparison.\n\nSingle‑incision sling versus transobturator sling\n- Leakage control after 1 year: Single‑incision slings make little to no difference compared with transobturator slings.\n- Long‑term pain (around 2 years): Single‑incision slings probably reduce pain compared with transobturator slings.\n- Painful sex: It is unclear whether single‑incision slings change the chance of painful sex.\n- Mesh problems: Single‑incision slings make little to no difference compared with transobturator slings.\n- Trouble emptying the bladder after surgery: Single‑incision slings probably result in a similar number or fewer cases than transobturator slings.\n- Quality of life after 1 year: People with single‑incision slings may have slightly lower quality of life than those with transobturator slings.\n- Need for repeat surgery or sling revision: It is unclear if there is any difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that single‑incision and transobturator slings control leakage similarly after 1 year. For many other results, we have less confidence. Some studies were small, and not all studies measured or reported all harms that matter to women. Results sometimes differed between studies, and the studies used different brands and ways of doing the surgery. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they received. Many studies did not follow people long enough to show long‑term safety, repeat surgery, or lasting quality of life.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
