Because of this, we cannot tell if it helps with pain or calming, or if it causes unwanted effects. Safety and long‑term effects are unknown.\n- Four studies are ongoing or awaiting assessment. Two will compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl (a strong pain medicine) in babies having surgery, and one will compare it with morphine during cooling after lack of oxygen at birth. Results are not available yet.\n- Future research needs to test dexmedetomidine carefully in newborn babies on breathing machines, measure outcomes that matter to families and clinicians, and track possible side effects and long‑term development.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are sedation and pain relief for newborns on breathing machines?\nSome sick newborn babies need a machine to help them breathe. This is called mechanical ventilation. Being on a breathing machine can be stressful and may be painful, for example after surgery or during procedures. Sedation means helping babies stay calm. Analgesia means pain relief.\n\nDoctors often use opioids (strong pain medicines) like morphine or fentanyl for calming and pain relief. These medicines can help, but they may slow breathing or lower blood pressure. Dexmedetomidine is another medicine used to calm and reduce pain. It works on certain nerve signals in the brain and may have less effect on heart rate and blood pressure. It is being used more often in babies and children, even though in many places it is not officially approved for pain relief in newborns.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine works well and is safe for calming and pain relief in newborn babies (under 4 weeks old) who are on breathing machines. We looked for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with opioids, with other non‑opioid medicines, or with placebo (a dummy treatment). We were most interested in levels of calming and pain relief. We also wanted to know about days on the breathing machine, the need for extra medicines, low blood pressure, death before discharge, and how babies develop over time.\n\nHow is this usually managed?\n- Opioids (strong pain medicines), such as morphine or fentanyl\n- Non‑opioid medicines, such as dexmedetomidine or ketamine\n- Comfort measures, such as gentle handling and swaddling, alongside medicines\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several medical databases and study registries in September 2023 for studies in newborns on breathing machines that compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines or placebo. We planned to summarize the results and judge how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe did not find any completed studies that met our criteria. This means we cannot say whether dexmedetomidine helps newborn babies on breathing machines feel less pain or stay calm, or how it compares with other medicines.\n\nWe found 4 studies that are ongoing or awaiting full assessment. Two appear eligible and will compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborn babies who need surgery. One will compare dexmedetomidine with morphine in babies who are being cooled after lack of oxygen at birth. Another study includes babies and children up to 3 years old and will look at dexmedetomidine versus ketamine plus dexmedetomidine during echocardiography (a heart ultrasound). These studies plan to include between small and moderate numbers of newborns. Their results may provide some information on dexmedetomidine’s benefits and safety in the future.\n\nMain results\nBecause there were no completed studies, we do not know if dexmedetomidine reduces pain or helps keep newborn babies calm on breathing machines. We also do not know if it affects:\n- how long babies stay on the breathing machine,\n- whether babies need extra medicines for calming or pain relief,\n- the chance of low blood pressure,\n- death before leaving the hospital,\n- how babies’ brains and development are affected over time.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there were no completed studies to answer our question. The studies that are underway are small and focus on specific groups of babies, such as those having surgery or cooling after lack of oxygen. One planned study includes older children as well as newborns. This means results may not apply to all newborn babies on breathing machines. We also do not have information on long‑term effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
