Direct pelvic floor muscle training (squeezing the pelvic floor muscles on purpose) may improve quality of life more than “indirect” exercises that do not use those muscles. Doing the exercises more days per week may lead to a large improvement. Unwanted effects were reported by some women, mostly when they used devices placed inside the vagina or rectum. Many studies did not report harms.\n- How training is delivered matters less than you might think. Training done one-to-one or in a group probably makes little to no difference for quality of life. Using e‑health (mobile app or online tools) to give instructions may help a little compared with written instructions.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence on some questions, such as the best exercise dose and body positions. Future studies should be larger, report harms clearly, and directly compare specific types, doses, and delivery of pelvic floor muscle training.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence in women?\nUrinary incontinence means leaking urine when you do not want to. This can happen with coughing, laughing, or exercise (called stress incontinence), with a sudden strong urge to wee (called urgency incontinence), or both (mixed incontinence). It can affect daily life, mood, and social activities.\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training?\nPelvic floor muscle training teaches you to squeeze and relax the muscles that support your bladder, womb, and bowel. These are the muscles at the bottom of your pelvis. Training can be “direct” (focused squeezes of these muscles) or it can be done with other body movements at the same time (“co‑ordinated” training). Some programs add devices that give resistance or feedback. Quality of life means how much symptoms affect your daily life and well-being.\n\nWhy compare different ways of doing these exercises?\nThere are many ways to teach and practice these exercises. Programs differ in the type of exercise, how often you do them (dose), and how they are delivered (at home, in a clinic, in a group, one‑to‑one, or by e‑health). Knowing which approaches help most can guide women and clinicians to choose options that fit their needs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which exercise types, doses, and delivery methods of pelvic floor muscle training work best to improve quality of life for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. We also looked for unwanted effects.\n\n[Optional] How is urinary incontinence treated?\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder)\n- Lifestyle changes (for example, reducing caffeine, weight management)\n- Medicines\n- Devices placed in the vagina\n- Surgery\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different types, doses, and delivery methods of pelvic floor muscle training in women with urinary incontinence. We summarized their results and rated how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies including 4920 women, mostly aged 45 to 65, who had stress incontinence or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. Studies took place in many countries, often in middle‑ or high‑income settings. All studies included direct pelvic floor muscle training in at least one group. Funding sources were not reported in the abstract. Some questions had no usable data.\n\nExercise type:\n- Co‑ordinated training (body movements with pelvic floor squeezes at the same time) compared with direct training: Co‑ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life.\n- Indirect training (exercises that do not use the pelvic floor muscles) compared with direct training: Direct training may improve quality of life more than indirect training.\n- Combining indirect training with direct training compared with direct training alone: Adding indirect training may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\nExercise dose:\n- Training with a resistance device compared with training without a device: Training without a device may slightly improve quality of life, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Doing the exercises more days per week compared with fewer days: Doing the exercises more days per week may cause a large improvement in quality of life. This finding comes from one small study.\n- Some dose comparisons, such as doing maximal versus submaximal squeezes, and doing exercises while upright versus lying down, had no data.\n\nExercise delivery:\n- Clinic‑supervised training compared with training at home: Clinic supervision may slightly improve quality of life, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Individual (one‑to‑one) supervision compared with group supervision: Individual supervision probably makes little to no difference to quality of life compared with group supervision.\n- Clinic supervision compared with e‑health supervision (mobile app contact with clinicians): Clinic supervision may make little to no difference, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- E‑health instruction compared with written instruction: E‑health delivery may slightly improve quality of life.\n\nUnwanted effects:\nNine studies reported harms. For every 100 women in these studies, about 6 had an unwanted effect. Almost all were linked to using devices placed inside the vagina or rectum. Reported effects included vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort. Many studies did not report harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because many studies were small, results varied across studies, and some groups had few or no studies. Not all studies measured the outcomes we cared about, or they did not report usable data. Some studies may have had problems with how people were assigned to treatments and how the treatments were given, which can affect the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
