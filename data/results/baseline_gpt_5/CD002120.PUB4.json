It also increases unwanted effects, especially irregular bleeding, and it probably increases headaches and nausea. Serious harms and long-term effects were not well studied, so we do not know enough about them.\n- Taking the pill continuously without a monthly break may reduce pain more than the standard monthly-break schedule, and may lead to fewer unwanted effects and fewer episodes of irregular bleeding. We do not know if the pill works better than anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen or naproxen, because there was very little research directly comparing them, and one study did not report harms.\n- Future research should follow people for longer, compare the pill with common pain medicines, and report all unwanted effects, including serious and long-term effects, so people can make more informed choices.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means period pain that happens without another known cause in the pelvis, such as endometriosis. It is very common and can be strong enough to affect school, work, and daily life. Many people use heat, rest, exercise, or pain medicines to cope. Doctors also often suggest the combined birth control pill, which contains two hormones (oestrogen and progestin) that prevent ovulation and thin the uterine lining. This can make periods lighter and less painful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if the combined birth control pill reduces period pain and improves daily life compared with a dummy pill, no treatment, other pill types or schedules, or anti-inflammatory painkillers. We also wanted to learn about unwanted effects, including irregular bleeding, headache, nausea, weight gain, serious harms, and time off work.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies in which people with painful periods took the combined birth control pill and were compared with a dummy pill, no treatment, other pill types or schedules, or anti-inflammatory painkillers. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we can place in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. Eleven studies compared the pill with a dummy pill or no treatment. Eight compared different doses or types of the pill. One compared two pill schedules with a dummy pill. One compared the pill with anti-inflammatory painkillers. The abstract did not report where the studies took place, how long they lasted, or who funded them.\n\nMain results\n\nCombined pill versus placebo or no treatment\n- Pain: The combined pill reduces period pain compared with a dummy pill or no treatment. We are confident about this finding. In simple terms, many people felt less pain while taking the pill.\n- Feeling better overall: The combined pill may increase the chance that pain improves. If 28 out of 100 people feel better with no treatment, then about 37 to 60 out of 100 may feel better with the pill.\n- Any unwanted effects: The pill probably increases the chance of having at least one unwanted effect.\n- Irregular bleeding: The pill increases irregular bleeding. For every 100 people not taking the pill, about 18 may have irregular bleeding. With the pill, about 39 to 60 out of 100 may have irregular bleeding.\n- Headache and nausea: The pill probably increases headaches and nausea.\n- Weight gain: We do not know if the pill increases weight gain.\n- Need for extra medicines and time off work: The pill may slightly reduce the need for extra pain medicines and may slightly reduce time off work or school.\n\nOne pill schedule or type versus another\n- Continuous use (no monthly break) versus the standard monthly-break schedule: Continuous use may reduce pain more. The standard schedule may slightly increase the chance of any unwanted effects and probably increases irregular bleeding compared with continuous use. We are uncertain about differences in serious harms, headaches, or nausea because there were too few and small studies.\n- Different oestrogen doses (20 micrograms versus 30 micrograms): We do not know if one dose improves pain more than the other.\n- Different generations (types) of pills: There is probably little to no difference in pain improvement between newer and older types.\n\nCombined pill versus anti-inflammatory painkillers\n- We do not know whether the pill reduces pain more than anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen or naproxen because there was only one small study. That study did not report unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident that the pill reduces pain and increases irregular bleeding when compared with a dummy pill or no treatment. Our confidence is only moderate that the pill increases headaches and nausea. For many other questions, we have little confidence because there were not enough studies, studies were small, some results varied between studies, and some studies did not report all outcomes we care about. Long-term effects and serious harms were rarely reported, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about them.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
