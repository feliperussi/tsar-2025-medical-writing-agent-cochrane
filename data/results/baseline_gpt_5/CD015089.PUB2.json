They may also correctly reassure many people whose dizziness comes from the inner ear. However, the tests can still miss some brain problems or wrongly suggest a brain problem in some people. We did not find reports of harms from doing these bedside checks themselves.\n- Most studies took place in hospital emergency care and many testers were specialists in brain or balance problems. We are less sure how well these checks work in primary care or when done by less‑specialized staff. Video versions of the tests (using goggles and recordings) did not clearly perform better and may label many people incorrectly.\n- We need more good-quality studies in different settings and with different types of clinicians. Future studies should test how well different users agree with each other, and compare care with and without HINTS, and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to see how these checks affect real‑world decisions.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is sudden severe dizziness (acute vestibular syndrome) and why does the cause matter?\nSudden severe dizziness can make the room feel like it is spinning (vertigo). People may feel sick, vomit, have jerking eye movements, or feel very unsteady. When these symptoms start suddenly and last for a while, doctors call it acute vestibular syndrome. This can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (peripheral cause) or a problem in the brain (central cause). A central cause can include a stroke. Treatments and urgency are very different, so finding the cause quickly matters.\n\nWhat are the HINTS and HINTS Plus checks?\nHINTS stands for head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew. These are quick bedside checks of eye and head movements:\n- Head impulse: the clinician gently and quickly turns your head to see how your eyes respond.\n- Nystagmus: the clinician looks for involuntary, jerking eye movements.\n- Test of skew: the clinician checks if the eyes are lined up correctly or slightly misaligned.\nHINTS Plus adds a simple hearing check, because sudden hearing loss can point to an inner ear cause. Some teams use video goggles to record eye movements (video‑assisted HINTS).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how accurate HINTS and HINTS Plus are at telling central (brain) causes from inner ear causes in people with sudden severe dizziness. We also wanted to know if doing the checks with video help changes accuracy, and whether accuracy differs by who does the test or where.\n\n[Optional] How is sudden severe dizziness checked?\nClinicians often use your medical history, risk factors (for example, for stroke), bedside exams like HINTS, and sometimes scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the brain.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies where clinicians used HINTS or HINTS Plus, with or without video, and compared the results with a final diagnosis based on scans or a specialist’s judgement. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 16 studies with 2024 people, on average about 60 years old. Most studies took place in hospital emergency care. About half the tests were done by neurologists or other brain/balance specialists. Twelve studies assessed HINTS, and five assessed HINTS Plus. Some used the tests at the bedside by visual inspection only. Others used video goggles. Most studies used MRI or a specialist’s final diagnosis as the reference. Time from symptom start varied. The abstract did not report how the studies were funded.\n\nMain results\n- Clinical HINTS (without video): Based on several studies, clinical HINTS may correctly flag most people who have a brain cause of dizziness, and may correctly reassure many people who do not. For example, out of 100 people who truly have a brain cause, clinical HINTS may pick up about 9 out of 10. Out of 100 people without a brain cause, it may correctly say “likely not brain” for about 9 out of 10. We have little confidence in the exact numbers because the studies had limits.\n- Video‑assisted HINTS (with goggles): Video HINTS may detect many people with a brain cause, but we are very uncertain about how well it avoids false alarms in people without a brain cause. The number of studies was small, and results varied a lot.\n- Clinical HINTS Plus (adds hearing check): Clinical HINTS Plus may correctly identify most people with a brain cause, but may be less good at avoiding false alarms than HINTS alone. For example, it may pick up about 9 to 10 out of 10 people with a brain cause, but out of 100 people without a brain cause, it may correctly say “likely not brain” for about 7 out of 10. We have little confidence in the exact numbers.\n- Video‑assisted HINTS Plus: Video HINTS Plus probably identifies many people with a brain cause, but probably labels many people without a brain cause as if they had one. For example, it may correctly pick up about 9 out of 10 with a brain cause, but may correctly reassure only about 3 to 4 out of 10 without a brain cause.\n\nOverall, in emergency care and in the hands of trained clinicians, HINTS and HINTS Plus may help find brain causes of sudden severe dizziness. But they can still miss some cases, and sometimes they point the wrong way. The bedside checks themselves were not reported to cause harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, and most were done in emergency care by highly trained specialists. This means the results may not apply to all settings or all clinicians. In some studies, the person doing the test may have known other clinical information, which could affect judgement. Not all studies reported everything we needed, and the time from symptom start differed across studies. There were few studies of video‑assisted testing, and results were mixed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
