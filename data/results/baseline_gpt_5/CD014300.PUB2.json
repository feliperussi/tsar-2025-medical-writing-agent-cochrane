For children and adolescents, we do not know if these programs improve mental well-being. These programs may make little to no difference to helpful behavior toward others (prosocial behavior) in children and adolescents. Programs may improve daily functioning for children, but we are very uncertain about this. The studies did not report unwanted effects, so we do not know about harms.\n- Most programs were given to groups by trained local helpers (paraprofessionals). We did not find adult results for functioning or prosocial behavior, and we do not know if any adult benefits last after the program ends.\n- We need more good-quality studies that measure what matters to people, report any unwanted effects, include both adults and children, and check if benefits last over time in different countries and crisis settings.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are humanitarian crises and why can they harm mental health?\nMany people around the world are forced to leave their homes because of wars, conflict, persecution, human rights violations, and other crises. Most of these people live in low- and middle-income countries (countries with lower average incomes). Life in these settings can be very stressful. People may face danger, loss, poor housing, and limited access to services. These stressors can harm mental health and daily life.\n\nWhat are psychosocial programs to promote mental health?\nPsychosocial means psychological and social. These programs try to build positive mental health, not only treat illness. They aim to improve mental well-being, daily functioning (how well people manage everyday life), coping (ways to handle stress), resilience (ability to bounce back after difficulties), quality of life, and prosocial behavior (helpful behavior toward others). Many programs use group activities, skills training, or social support. They are often led by trained local helpers who are not mental health professionals (paraprofessionals).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychosocial group programs that aim to promote positive mental health work better than no program, usual activities, or a waiting list for people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We looked at adults, children, and adolescents. We focused on mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope, and prosocial behavior. We also wanted to know if people stayed in the programs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies in many databases. We combined their results and judged how confident we could be in the findings. Many studies randomly placed people into different groups to keep the groups similar (a fair test of the programs).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies with 7917 people. Nine studies included children and adolescents, and 4 studies included adults. All programs were given to groups, mostly by paraprofessionals (trained local helpers who are the first point of contact for mental health care). Studies took place in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most studies lasted about 10 to 32 weeks from start to end of follow-up. Universities and non-governmental organizations funded most studies.\n\nMain results\n- Adults: Psychosocial group programs may improve mental well-being slightly by the end of the program. We do not know if this benefit lasts over time because follow-up results were unclear. No adult studies measured daily functioning or prosocial behavior.\n- Children and adolescents: We do not know if psychosocial group programs improve mental well-being. These programs may make little to no difference to prosocial behavior. Programs may improve daily functioning slightly, but we are very uncertain because this finding came from one small study. At follow-up for children and adolescents, we still do not know if the programs help mental well-being or prosocial behavior.\n- Unwanted effects and acceptability: The studies did not report unwanted effects. We also do not have clear information about how acceptable these programs were to people (for example, how many stopped taking part).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there were few studies for several outcomes, and some studies were small. In some studies, people may have known which program they were getting. The studies also used different types of people, programs, and ways to measure outcomes. Not all important outcomes were measured in all age groups, and few studies checked if any benefits lasted over time. These issues make it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
