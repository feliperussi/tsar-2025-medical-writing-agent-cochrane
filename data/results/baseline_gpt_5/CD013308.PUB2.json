Using stronger gum (4 mg) instead of weaker gum (2 mg) also helps more people quit. Information on unwanted effects (side effects) was limited, but serious heart problems were rare, and most studies found little to no difference in harms between options.\n- A nicotine patch alone and a fast‑acting product alone lead to similar quit rates. Higher‑dose patches sometimes help more than lower‑dose patches, while some higher‑dose patches led more people to stop treatment because of side effects in a small number of studies. Starting NRT before quit day (called preloading) probably helps more people quit than starting on the quit day.\n- Future studies should report unwanted effects clearly and consistently, compare how long people should use NRT, and test different NRT types and timing in ways that matter to people trying to quit.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) gives your body nicotine without the harmful smoke from cigarettes. It helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms when you stop smoking. NRT comes in several forms, such as patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, mouth spray, and nasal spray.\n\nWhy might the way you use NRT matter?\nPeople use NRT in different ways. For example, you can wear a patch all day, or you can use fast‑acting products when cravings hit. You can also use a patch and a fast‑acting product together. The dose (how much nicotine you get), how long you use it, and when you start it (before or on quit day) may change how well it works and how it feels to use.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which ways of using NRT help the most people stop smoking for at least 6 months. We also wanted to learn about unwanted effects, including serious health problems and people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\n[Optional] What kinds of NRT are available?\n- Patches (give a steady amount of nicotine through the skin; some are worn 24 hours, others 16 hours)\n- Fast‑acting products you use when you have a craving:\n  – gum\n  – lozenges\n  – inhalers\n  – mouth spray\n  – nasal spray\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of using NRT, summarized the results, and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 68 studies with 43,327 adults who wanted to quit smoking. Most studies took place in the community or in healthcare clinics. All studies measured quitting at 6 months or later. The studies compared different NRT forms, doses, and ways of using them, including starting before quit day.\n\nMain results\n- Patch plus fast‑acting NRT versus one product alone: Using a patch together with a fast‑acting product increases the chance of quitting slightly but importantly. We are confident about this finding.\n- Stronger gum versus weaker gum: Using 4 mg gum instead of 2 mg gum increases the chance of quitting. We are confident about this finding.\n- Patch versus fast‑acting NRT alone: Using a patch alone or a fast‑acting product alone makes little to no difference to quit rates. We are confident about this finding.\n- Higher‑dose versus lower‑dose patches:\n  – For some 24‑hour patches, higher doses probably make little to no difference compared with standard doses.\n  – A 21 mg (24‑hour) patch probably helps more than a 14 mg (24‑hour) patch.\n  – A 25 mg (16‑hour) patch probably helps slightly more than a 15 mg (16‑hour) patch.\n- Starting NRT before quitting (preloading): Starting NRT while still smoking, in the days or weeks before quit day, probably increases the chance of quitting compared with starting on quit day.\n- How long to use NRT: It is unclear whether using NRT for a longer time helps more than a shorter time. We do not know the best duration for patches or for combining products.\n- Which fast‑acting type works best: It is unclear whether any fast‑acting type (gum, lozenge, inhaler, mouth spray, nasal spray) works better than others.\n\nUnwanted effects and safety\nMost studies reported few serious heart problems. Across most comparisons, NRT options made little to no difference to serious harms, but the information was limited and measured in different ways. In one study, more people stopped treatment when using nasal spray than when using patches. In two studies, more people stopped treatment when using some higher‑dose patches than when using standard‑dose patches.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are confident about some main findings, like using a patch plus a fast‑acting product and using stronger gum. For other questions, our confidence is lower because many studies were small, people and staff often knew which product they were using, and not all studies reported unwanted effects in the same way or at all. For questions about how long to use NRT and which fast‑acting type works best, there were not enough good‑quality studies to be sure about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
