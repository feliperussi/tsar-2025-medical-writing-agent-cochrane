  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs nasal high flow therapy (high‑flow warm, humid air and oxygen through the nose) as good as CPAP or NIPPV (gentle air support) for preterm babies?\n\nKey Messages\n- Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference to death or long‑term lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a long‑lasting lung problem) compared with CPAP or NIPPV in babies born at 28 weeks or later. Compared with CPAP, it probably leads to more early treatment failure (needing stronger support in the first 3 days), but probably does not increase the need for a breathing machine (ventilator). It probably causes less nose injury and may reduce air leaking around the lung (pneumothorax). Harms were reported (more early treatment failure).\n- When compared with NIPPV, the differences in death or long‑term lung disease were unclear. Nasal high flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the need for a breathing machine and early treatment failure, and probably causes less nose injury.\n- We did not find enough good‑quality evidence for babies born before 28 weeks. Future studies should include more extremely preterm babies, use consistent methods and settings, and report benefits and unwanted effects that matter to families.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is nasal high flow therapy?\nNasal high flow therapy gives warm, moist air and oxygen through two small nose prongs at a high flow. It helps keep airways open and makes breathing easier. It is a type of non‑invasive support, which means it does not use a tube in the windpipe.\n\nWhy do preterm babies need breathing support?\nPreterm means a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Many preterm babies have breathing problems soon after birth. One common problem is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which happens because the lungs are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a natural substance that helps the lungs stay open). Breathing support can help babies get enough oxygen while their lungs grow.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to learn if nasal high flow therapy works as well as other non‑invasive supports, such as:\n- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): gentle air pressure through the nose to keep the lungs open.\n- Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV): gentle breaths through the nose given at regular times.\nWe looked at benefits and unwanted effects, including death, long‑term lung disease, early treatment failure, need for a breathing machine (ventilator through a tube in the windpipe), air leaks around the lungs (pneumothorax), and nose injury.\n\n[Optional] How is breathing support given without a breathing tube?\n- Nasal high flow therapy (warm, humid air and oxygen at high flow through small nose prongs)\n- CPAP (gentle air pressure through the nose to keep lungs open)\n- NIPPV (gentle breaths delivered through the nose at regular times)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with CPAP or NIPPV in preterm babies with early breathing problems. We summarized the results and judged how confident we are in them based on study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm babies. Most compared nasal high flow therapy with CPAP, and some compared it with NIPPV. The studies used different devices and air‑flow settings. Some studies allowed “rescue” CPAP if nasal high flow was not enough, before using a breathing machine. Some allowed surfactant to be given using the INSURE method (intubation, surfactant, extubation) without counting this as treatment failure. Very few babies were extremely preterm (born before 28 weeks). Several studies did not describe their methods clearly. We did not find any studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with room air or with low‑flow nasal tubes.\n\nMain results\nCompared with CPAP:\n- Death or long‑term lung disease: Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference.\n- Death: Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference.\n- Long‑term lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia): Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference.\n- Early treatment failure (within 3 days): Nasal high flow therapy probably increases early treatment failure.\n- Need for a breathing machine (within 3 days): Nasal high flow therapy probably makes little to no difference.\n- Air leaking around the lung (pneumothorax): Nasal high flow therapy probably reduces pneumothorax.\n- Nose injury: Nasal high flow therapy probably reduces nose injury.\n\nCompared with NIPPV:\n- Death or long‑term lung disease: It is unclear if nasal high flow therapy has an effect.\n- Death: Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference.\n- Early treatment failure and need for a breathing machine (within 3 days): Nasal high flow therapy probably makes little to no difference.\n- Nose injury: Nasal high flow therapy probably reduces nose injury.\n- Pneumothorax: Nasal high flow therapy probably makes little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in some findings, but have little confidence in others. Some studies were small, and hospital staff knew which support each baby received. Not all studies reported everything we needed. The studies used different devices and air‑flow settings. Most babies were born at 28 weeks or later, so the evidence does not cover babies born before 28 weeks well. These issues make it harder to be sure about the results, especially for the NIPPV comparison.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
