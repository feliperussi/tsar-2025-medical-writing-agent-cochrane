Diet changes on their own probably make little to no difference. Over longer follow-up (15 months or more), these programs may make little to no difference. Unwanted effects (harms) were rarely reported, so we cannot be sure about them.\n- Most programs took place in schools in wealthier countries. We found little information about programs run at home or in the community, and very little about children living with disabilities or about health inequalities.\n- Future research should test programs in homes and communities, include children with disabilities, report unwanted effects carefully, and follow children for longer to see if any benefits last.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why does prevention matter?\nChildhood obesity means a child has too much body fat for their height and age. This can affect health, development, and well-being now and later in life. Preventing obesity is important because it is easier to build healthy habits early than to reverse weight gain later.\n\nWhat kinds of programs try to prevent obesity?\nPrograms aim to help children eat in a healthier way, move more, sit less, and sleep well. Some focus on food choices at school or at home. Others increase physical activity during the school day or after school. Some combine healthy eating with activity changes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs that change diet, activity, or both can prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11. We looked at effects on:\n- Body mass index (BMI), a number that uses height and weight to check body size for age\n- zBMI, a way to compare a child’s BMI with other children of the same age and sex\n- Serious unwanted effects (for example, injuries or other health problems)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared healthy eating and/or activity programs with usual practice or no program in children aged 5 to 11. We combined the results and judged how much confidence to place in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 172 studies with 189,707 children. We combined results from 149 studies with 160,267 children. Most studies took place in wealthier countries. Schools were the most common setting (111 studies). Some programs took place in the community, at home, in clinics, by telehealth, or across more than one setting. Program length varied from a single visit to 4 years, with many lasting less than 9 months. Most studies excluded children with a mental or physical disability. Non-industry funders supported most studies; 24 studies had some industry funding.\n\nMain results\n\nDiet-only programs compared with no program or usual practice\n- Diet-only programs may make little to no difference to BMI or zBMI in the short term and medium term.\n- Diet-only programs probably make little to no difference to BMI or zBMI in the long term.\n- It is unclear if diet-only programs cause unwanted effects. Only a few studies reported harms, and results were mixed.\n\nActivity-only programs compared with no program or usual practice\n- Activity-only programs may make little to no difference to BMI or zBMI in the short term and long term.\n- Activity-only programs probably reduce BMI and zBMI slightly in the medium term.\n- Reports of unwanted effects were uncommon. A few studies noted minor issues (for example, ankle sprains). Many studies did not report harms clearly, so we cannot be sure.\n\nCombined diet and activity programs compared with no program or usual practice\n- Combined programs may reduce BMI and zBMI slightly in the short term.\n- Combined programs probably reduce BMI and zBMI slightly in the medium term.\n- Combined programs may make little to no difference to BMI and zBMI in the long term.\n- Reports of unwanted effects were uncommon and varied (for example, injuries or low levels of extreme dieting behavior). Many studies did not report harms clearly, so we cannot be sure.\n\nWhat do these results mean for children and families?\nSchool-based activity programs, and programs that combine activity with healthy eating, can help lower unhealthy weight slightly over about 9 to 15 months. Diet changes alone are less likely to help. We do not know if any small benefits last beyond 15 months. We also do not know enough about unwanted effects because many studies did not report them.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident about the small, medium-term benefits of school-based activity programs, with or without diet changes. We have less confidence in other results because:\n- Studies used different types of programs, lengths, and ways of measuring outcomes, so results varied.\n- Many studies were small, and not all reported everything we needed, especially unwanted effects.\n- Most studies were done in schools in wealthier countries and excluded children with disabilities. This means the results may not apply to programs at home or in the community, to all regions, or to all groups of children.\n- There were fewer studies that followed children for 15 months or longer, so we do not know if benefits last.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
