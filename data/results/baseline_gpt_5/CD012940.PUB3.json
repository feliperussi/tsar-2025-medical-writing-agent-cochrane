  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nRe-feeding or discarding gastric residuals (milk left in the stomach after a tube feed): which is better for preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Based on 1 small study, re-feeding the stomach milk that is drawn back before the next tube feed may make little to no difference to important outcomes such as serious gut illness (necrotising enterocolitis, a dangerous bowel problem), death before leaving the hospital, time to reach full tube feeds, days needing feeding through a vein, or weight gain in the hospital. The study did not report some unwanted effects, such as vomiting or blood infections.\n- It is unclear if re-feeding changes the number of times feeds need to be stopped for half a day or longer.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be sure which approach is better. Larger, well-designed studies should measure benefits and unwanted effects that matter to families and care teams, and follow babies for longer.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are gastric residuals and why do they matter for preterm babies?\nPreterm babies often need milk through a feeding tube because they are too small or weak to feed by mouth. Before the next feed, nurses sometimes gently pull back on the tube to see how much milk is left in the baby’s stomach. This leftover milk is called gastric residuals. Some neonatal units put this milk back into the baby’s stomach (re-feeding). Others throw it away (discarding).\n\nWhy might re-feeding help or harm?\nRe-feeding may help the gut learn to work by returning partially digested milk and natural stomach juices that contain enzymes and hormones. This might support gut movement and growth. However, if the residual looks abnormal (for example, green, bloody, or very large), putting it back might raise the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel problem called necrotising enterocolitis (a dangerous infection and injury of the bowel), or sepsis (a severe body-wide infection).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to learn if re-feeding the residuals, compared with discarding them, helps preterm babies grow and reach full feeds sooner, and whether it affects harms such as bowel problems, infections, or death before hospital discharge.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding versus discarding stomach residuals in preterm babies. We combined and summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 1 study with 72 preterm babies. The study compared putting the stomach milk back versus throwing it away. The care teams and families knew which approach the babies received. The study did not report its funding source. Babies were cared for in a hospital setting and received milk through feeding tubes. The study measured outcomes such as time to reach full feeds, days on feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition), time to regain birth weight, serious bowel problems (necrotising enterocolitis or a sudden hole in the bowel), death before leaving the hospital, growth by discharge, and feed interruptions. Some possible unwanted effects, like vomiting or blood infections, were not reported.\n\nMain results\n- Time to reach full tube feeds: Re-feeding may make little to no difference to how long it takes babies to reach full feeds.\n- Days on feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition): Re-feeding may make little to no difference to how many days babies need feeding through a vein.\n- Regaining birth weight and in-hospital growth: Re-feeding may make little to no difference to the time to regain birth weight or to growth by the time of discharge.\n- Serious bowel problems (necrotising enterocolitis or a sudden hole in the bowel): Re-feeding may make little to no difference to the chance of these bowel problems.\n- Death before leaving the hospital: Re-feeding may make little to no difference to the chance of dying before discharge.\n- Feed interruptions lasting 12 hours or more: We do not know if re-feeding has any effect on the number of long feed interruptions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there was only 1 small study, and the teams and families knew which approach each baby received. This makes the results less certain. The small number of babies means we cannot be sure about benefits or harms, especially for less common but serious problems. Also, the study did not report some unwanted effects, such as vomiting or blood infections, and did not report longer-term outcomes after discharge.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
