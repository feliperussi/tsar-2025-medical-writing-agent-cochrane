In the small studies we could use, omeprazole and esomeprazole did not show clear benefits over placebo (dummy treatment) in babies, and different doses of rabeprazole and pantoprazole in older children seemed to work about the same. Unwanted effects were not well reported.\n- We could not combine the study results because the studies measured symptoms in different ways and followed children for short times. There were not enough usable data to judge other medicines, such as H2 blockers (medicines that lower stomach acid in a different way) or alginates (medicines that form a protective layer on stomach contents).\n- Future research should include larger, longer studies that report symptoms and unwanted effects clearly. We especially need studies in preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is reflux in babies and children?\nReflux, also called gastro-oesophageal reflux, happens when stomach contents flow back into the food pipe (oesophagus). Many young babies spit up often, and this usually gets better with age. When reflux causes symptoms strong enough to need treatment, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\n\nWhy does reflux matter?\nFor some babies and children, reflux symptoms last longer and can be distressing. Families and health professionals may try nonmedical steps first, such as feeding changes or reassurance. If symptoms remain bothersome, some use medicines that reduce stomach acid or protect the stomach contents.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if medicines used to treat reflux help babies and children. We looked at symptom relief and other measures, such as tests of acid in the oesophagus or camera tests of the food pipe.\n\n[Optional] How is reflux treated?\nCommon medicine options include:\n– proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a type of medicine that lowers stomach acid (for example omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole)\n– H2 blockers (also called H2 antagonists), medicines that lower stomach acid in a different way (for example ranitidine)\n– alginates, medicines that form a protective gel on top of stomach contents to reduce reflux\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies in babies and children that compared reflux medicines with placebo or with another medicine. We summarized the results we could use and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 babies and children up to 16 years old. We were able to use summary results from 14 studies; many others did not provide enough data for us to use. Some studies followed children for short periods, from about 2 to 8 weeks. The studies took place in various settings, but the abstract did not list the countries or funding sources. We grouped the results by age: infants up to 12 months, and children aged 12 months to 16 years. The medicines studied included PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole), H2 blockers (such as ranitidine), and alginates. We could not combine the study results because they measured symptoms in different ways and included different types of people.\n\nMain results\nInfants (up to 12 months):\n- Omeprazole compared with placebo: It is unclear if omeprazole reduces reflux symptoms in babies. Both groups tended to improve over time, and we are not confident in these results.\n- Omeprazole compared with ranitidine: It is unclear whether omeprazole or ranitidine works better. Both may reduce symptoms to a similar degree, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n- Esomeprazole compared with placebo (in newborns): It is unclear if esomeprazole reduces reflux symptoms more than placebo. Both groups improved, and we are not confident in the findings.\n\nChildren (12 months to 16 years):\n- Rabeprazole at different doses: It is unclear if higher doses work better than lower doses. Both doses seemed to lead to similar symptom changes, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n- Pantoprazole at different doses: It is unclear if different doses improve symptoms. Dose differences appeared to make little to no difference, but we are very uncertain.\n- Other medicines: There were not enough usable data to judge H2 blockers or alginates in children in a reliable way.\n\nOther outcomes:\n- In infants, there were no usable summary data on camera tests of the food pipe (endoscopy). In older children, limited data suggested PPIs may or may not help these findings, but we are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies were small and short, and did not report results in the same way. Many studies did not share enough data for us to use. Because of these issues, we could not combine results to give clearer answers. We also found little information on unwanted effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
