  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs magnetic seizure therapy (MST: brain stimulation with magnetic pulses) as good and safe as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT: brain stimulation with a small electrical current) for people with schizophrenia (a long-lasting mental health condition that affects thoughts, feelings, and behavior)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found only 1 small, short study comparing MST with ECT in adults with active schizophrenia. MST may make little to no difference to symptoms compared with ECT. MST may lead to fewer memory and thinking problems after treatment and may improve thinking more than ECT. The study did not report many details about other unwanted effects. Overall, we are not sure if these findings are true.\n- The findings come from adults in the short term. We do not know if they apply to children, older adults, or long-term treatment.\n- We need larger, better-designed, and longer studies that compare MST with ECT and other options, and that report outcomes important to people, such as symptoms, thinking and memory, daily functioning, quality of life, and unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia?\nSchizophrenia is a chronic condition, which means it lasts for a long time. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, confused thinking, and low motivation. These symptoms can affect work, school, and relationships.\n\nHow is schizophrenia usually treated?\nMost people with schizophrenia take antipsychotic medicines. Some also have talking therapies and support with housing, work, and family life. About 1 in 5 people do not respond well to antipsychotic medicines and may look for other options. ECT is one option used for severe illness. MST is a newer type of brain stimulation being studied.\n\nWhat are MST and ECT?\nBoth MST and ECT aim to trigger a brief, controlled seizure to help reset brain activity. MST uses strong magnetic pulses placed on the head. ECT uses a small electrical current. People receive these treatments in hospital with careful monitoring and care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if MST works as well as ECT for improving symptoms of schizophrenia. We also wanted to know which treatment is better tolerated, including effects on thinking and memory, and other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared MST with ECT or other treatments in people with schizophrenia. We summarized the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 1 study that included 79 adults with active (acute) schizophrenia. The study lasted 4 weeks. People received MST plus standard care or ECT plus standard care. The abstract did not say where the study took place or who funded it.\n\nSymptoms\n- MST may make little to no difference to overall symptoms compared with ECT. This includes positive symptoms (such as hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (such as low motivation and social withdrawal).\n- Because this is based on one small, short study, we are not sure if this is the true effect.\n\nThinking and memory\n- MST may reduce delayed memory problems and may reduce overall thinking problems after treatment compared with ECT.\n- MST may improve thinking skills more than ECT.\n- These findings are promising but uncertain, because they come from limited data.\n\nLeaving treatment early and unwanted effects\n- MST may make little to no difference in the number of people who stop treatment early for any reason compared with ECT, including stopping due to unwanted effects or because the treatment does not help.\n- The study did not report many details about other unwanted effects. We are not sure about the safety profile of MST compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it comes from only one small study that lasted just 4 weeks. People in the study may have known which treatment they received. The study ended early and the groups may not have been fully similar at the start. Not all outcomes that matter to people were reported. These issues mean the results could be different from the truth.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
