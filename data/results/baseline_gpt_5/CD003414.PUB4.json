  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nNatural cycle, hormone therapy, or an HCG trigger: which works best to prepare the womb lining for frozen embryo transfer (FET, placing a frozen embryo into the womb)?\n\nKey messages\n- We did not find clear differences in benefits or harms between natural cycles, natural cycles with an HCG trigger (a hormone shot to time ovulation), and hormone therapy cycles (oestrogen and progesterone) for frozen embryo transfer. When hormone therapy was used with an extra medicine called a GnRHa (a medicine that temporarily switches off natural hormones), it probably made little to no difference for having a baby compared with hormone therapy without it. Side effects and other unwanted effects were often not reported, so we cannot fully judge safety.\n- For natural cycles with or without an HCG trigger, the chances of ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage were probably similar. For other outcomes, such as live birth and having twins or more, the results were uncertain or suggested little to no difference.\n- We need larger, well-designed studies that clearly report live births, miscarriages, multiple pregnancies, side effects for the mother, and practical issues such as timing and costs. Research should also report results for cycles that use medicines to induce ovulation, where data were not clearly presented.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is frozen embryo transfer and why prepare the womb lining?\nFrozen embryo transfer (FET) is when doctors place a frozen and then thawed embryo into the womb. Many people use FET after in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The embryo needs to meet a healthy womb lining (the endometrium, the soft layer inside the womb) at the right time to start a pregnancy. Doctors can prepare the womb lining in different ways to try to improve the chance of having a baby.\n\nWhat are the ways to prepare the womb lining for FET?\n- Natural cycle: you ovulate naturally (release an egg). The clinic times the transfer to match your own cycle.\n- Modified natural cycle with an HCG trigger: you have a shot of HCG (a hormone) to trigger ovulation at a known time.\n- Hormone therapy (HT) cycle: you take oestrogen and then progesterone to build and support the womb lining. Some clinics add a GnRHa (a medicine that temporarily switches off your natural hormones) to control timing.\nSome clinics also use medicines to induce ovulation. The abstract for this review did not present clear results for those cycles.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of preparing the womb lining works best and is safest for FET. We looked mainly at live birth and miscarriage. We also looked at ongoing pregnancy and multiple pregnancy (twins or more).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these methods for people having FET. We summarized their results and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 studies with 6352 women having frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared natural cycles, modified natural cycles with an HCG trigger, hormone therapy cycles, and hormone therapy with added GnRHa. Many studies did not report all the outcomes we were most interested in.\n\nMain results\nNatural cycle versus hormone therapy\n- It is unclear if natural cycles or hormone therapy cycles lead to different chances of live birth, miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, or multiple pregnancy. The evidence was limited and the results could go either way.\n\nNatural cycle versus hormone therapy with GnRHa\n- These approaches probably make little to no difference to the chance of having a baby. They also probably make little to no difference to multiple pregnancy. For miscarriage and ongoing pregnancy, it is unclear if there is any difference.\n\nNatural cycle versus modified natural cycle with an HCG trigger\n- For ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage, these approaches probably make little to no difference. For live birth and multiple pregnancy, they may make little to no difference, but we are uncertain.\n\nModified natural cycle with an HCG trigger versus hormone therapy\n- It is unclear if there is any difference between these two approaches for live birth, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, or multiple pregnancy. The available evidence was limited.\n\nModified natural cycle with an HCG trigger versus hormone therapy with GnRHa\n- It is unclear if there is any difference between these two approaches for live birth, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, or multiple pregnancy.\n\nHormone therapy versus hormone therapy with GnRHa\n- Adding a GnRHa probably makes little to no difference to the chance of having a baby. For miscarriage and ongoing pregnancy, adding a GnRHa may make little to no difference. For multiple pregnancy, it is unclear if there is any difference.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for you?\nAcross the most common ways to prepare the womb lining, results were very similar. Any differences in the chance of having a baby or having a miscarriage are likely small, and for several comparisons we do not know if there is any difference. Unwanted effects, such as side effects from medicines, were often not reported, so we cannot fully compare safety.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in many of the findings because:\n- Many studies did not report key outcomes, such as live birth or side effects for the mother.\n- The study methods were not always clearly described, so we cannot be sure the groups were treated in the same way apart from the cycle type.\n- There were few events, such as miscarriages or multiple pregnancies, and some studies were small. This makes the results uncertain.\nAlso, the abstract did not present clear results for cycles that use medicines to induce ovulation, so we cannot draw conclusions for those cycles.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
