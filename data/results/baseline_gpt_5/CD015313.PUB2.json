  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo medicines that thin mucus (mucolytics) help children with chronic wet lung disease (chronic suppurative lung disease)?\n\nKey Messages\n- Based on one small study, inhaled salty water (3% hypertonic saline) used during stable periods may reduce lung flare-ups and may improve breathing test results in children with bronchiectasis. However, we are not confident in these findings. The study did not clearly report side effects, but no child stopped the treatment because of them.\n- We found no studies of mucolytics used during a lung flare-up, and no studies that measured quality of life. We also did not find studies of oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, or mucolytics in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (a long-lasting wet cough due to bacterial infection).\n- Future research should include larger, longer, well-designed studies in different groups of children, and should report outcomes that matter to families, such as quality of life and unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is chronic wet lung disease (chronic suppurative lung disease)?\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a long-lasting lung condition where thick mucus and ongoing infection cause a wet or productive cough. Two common forms are:\n- bronchiectasis (widened, inflamed airways that trap mucus)\n- protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB; a wet cough caused by bacteria that lasts for weeks)\n\nChildren with CSLD often have repeated chest infections and trouble clearing mucus, which can affect daily life.\n\nWhy look at mucolytics?\nMucolytics are medicines that thin mucus (phlegm) so the lungs can clear it more easily. By helping mucus move out, they may break the cycle of infection and inflammation. One mucolytic is hypertonic saline, which is salty water inhaled as a fine mist (nebulized) before airway clearance exercises.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if mucolytics:\n- reduce the number of lung flare-ups (exacerbations)\n- improve breathing and quality of life\n- cause unwanted effects\n\n[Optional] How is CSLD treated?\nFamilies and clinicians may use a mix of care, such as:\n- airway clearance or chest physiotherapy (exercises to help move mucus)\n- antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections), especially during flare-ups\n- inhaled medicines, such as bronchodilators to open the airways\n- vaccinations and general health support\nMucolytics may be added to help thin and clear mucus.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared mucolytics with no mucolytic or placebo in children with CSLD. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we can have in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 1 study in 52 children with non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, seen in a hospital outpatient clinic. The children were about 9 years old. The study compared 3% hypertonic saline inhaled before chest physiotherapy with chest physiotherapy alone. Each phase lasted 8 weeks. Funding sources and the country of the study were not reported in the abstract.\n\nThis study looked at mucolytic use during a stable period, not during a flare-up. It did not measure quality of life. The study reported fewer lung flare-ups and better breathing test results (FEV1 and FVC) with hypertonic saline than with physiotherapy alone. However, we cannot be sure about these benefits because of concerns about the study methods. The study did not clearly report side effects, but there were no dropouts due to side effects.\n\nWe did not find any studies of oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, or mucolytics in children with PBB. We also did not find studies in settings other than hospital outpatients. Two ongoing studies (one inhaled hypertonic saline and one oral erdosteine) may add more information in the future.\n\nMain results in plain language\n- Hypertonic saline during stable periods: It is unclear if hypertonic saline reduces the number of lung flare-ups or improves lung function. The single small study suggests it may help, but we are not confident in the results.\n- Quality of life: We do not know if mucolytics improve quality of life because the study did not measure it.\n- Unwanted effects: The study reported no children stopping treatment because of side effects, but side effects were not fully described, so we cannot judge the risks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it comes from only one small, short study in one group of children. People in the study likely knew which treatment they were getting. Some data were missing, and the way outcomes were measured and reported may have favored certain results. The study did not measure quality of life or report side effects in detail. We also lack studies of other mucolytics, use during flare-ups, and use in children with PBB.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2024.",
