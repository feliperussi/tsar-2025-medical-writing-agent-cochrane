  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (light treatment that uses a special dye and light to kill germs) to deep gum cleaning help treat gum disease or problems around dental implants?\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know if adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to deep cleaning under the gum line (subgingival instrumentation, also called scaling and root planing) improves gum health at 6 months. Most studies did not report side effects; a few reported none, and one abscess occurred but it is unclear if it was linked to aPDT.\n- No studies included people with peri-implantitis (bone loss around implants). One very small study included people with peri-implant mucositis (swollen gums around implants) but did not report 6‑month results.\n- Future research should include larger, well-designed studies that follow people for longer, report side effects, comfort and quality of life, and include people with problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are gum disease and problems around dental implants?\nGum disease (periodontitis) is a long-lasting condition where gums and bone that support the teeth become inflamed and damaged. If it is not treated, the tissues that hold teeth in place can be destroyed over time.\n\nPeri-implant diseases happen in the tissues around dental implants. Peri-implant mucositis means the gums around an implant are inflamed. Peri-implantitis means there is ongoing inflammation plus loss of the bone that supports the implant.\n\nHow are these conditions usually treated?\nTreatment aims to clean the spaces (pockets) under the gum line and stop further damage to the gums and bone. Common steps include:\n- deep cleaning under the gum line (subgingival instrumentation, also called scaling and root planing)\n- improving daily mouth care\n- controlling risk factors (for example, stopping smoking)\n- surgery in some cases\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a light-based treatment. A special dye (photosensitizer) is put on the area first. The dye sticks to germs. A light is then shined on the area, and the light and dye work together to kill the germs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether adding aPDT to deep cleaning helps people with periodontitis or problems around dental implants. We looked for changes at about 6 months in:\n- pocket depth (how deep the spaces under the gum line are)\n- bleeding on probing (if gums bleed when gently checked)\n- clinical attachment level (how firmly the tooth is supported by tissue)\n- gum recession (how much the gum has pulled back)\n- pocket closure (pockets becoming shallow enough to be healthy)\n- side effects\nWe were also interested in bone changes around implants, and how satisfied people were with treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared deep cleaning with added aPDT against deep cleaning alone or deep cleaning with sham (placebo) light. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we could have in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies with 1407 adults. Many studies treated different sides of the same mouth with different treatments (split-mouth). Only 18 studies treated separate groups of people. Studies were small, with between 10 and 88 people.\n\nIn most studies, aPDT was given once; in some, it was given 2 to 4 times. Deep cleaning used hand tools, power tools, or both and was done before aPDT. Five studies used sham (placebo) light in the comparison group.\n\nAdding aPDT during active treatment of periodontitis:\n- It is unclear if adding aPDT reduces pocket depth or bleeding, or improves tooth attachment or gum recession at 6 months. Any small differences reported were unlikely to matter to people in daily life.\n- Many studies reported no side effects related to aPDT.\n\nAdding aPDT during supportive care (ongoing maintenance after active treatment):\n- It is unclear if adding aPDT reduces pocket depth or bleeding, or improves tooth attachment or gum recession at 6 months. The findings were imprecise and did not show clear benefits.\n- Side effects were rarely reported. One person developed an abscess, but we cannot tell if this was due to aPDT.\n\nNo studies measured pocket closure at 6 months, or reported patient satisfaction or quality of life. We did not find any studies in people with peri-implantitis. One very small study included people with peri-implant mucositis but did not provide 6‑month data.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because:\n- People giving the treatment often knew which treatment was used, which can affect how care is given and measured.\n- The studies were very small, and there were not enough studies to be sure about the results.\n- Results differed between studies in ways we could not explain.\n- Important outcomes, like pocket closure, satisfaction, and quality of life, were not reported.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
