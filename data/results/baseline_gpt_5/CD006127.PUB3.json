  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes tighter blood pressure control help prevent diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy) in people with diabetes?\n\nKey Messages\n- More intensive blood pressure control reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy (eye damage caused by diabetes) over about 5 years, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure. It probably makes little to no difference to worsening of diabetic retinopathy once it has started. Deaths were probably similar between groups, but episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension, which can cause dizziness or fainting) may be more common with more intensive control.\n- More intensive blood pressure control may make little to no difference to severe eye problems, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (an advanced stage with new fragile blood vessels), macular edema (swelling in the part of the retina that is responsible for sharp central vision), or bleeding into the gel of the eye (vitreous hemorrhage). It is unclear if it affects large drops in vision.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure, or for many outcomes that matter to patients (like vision, quality of life, and costs). Future studies should follow people for longer, measure these outcomes carefully, and use similar blood pressure targets so results are easier to compare.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?\nDiabetic retinopathy is eye damage caused by diabetes. High blood sugar can harm small blood vessels in the retina, the light‑sensitive layer at the back of the eye. Over time, this can lead to blurred vision, trouble seeing at night, and blindness. Keeping blood sugar under control helps prevent eye damage. Doctors also think blood pressure control may help because high blood pressure can strain eye blood vessels.\n\nHow can blood pressure control help?\nHigh blood pressure (also called hypertension) means the force of blood pushing against your artery walls is too high. Medicines to lower blood pressure, and careful monitoring, may reduce stress on eye blood vessels. We wanted to understand if tighter blood pressure control protects the eyes of people with diabetes, and whether it causes unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if more intensive blood pressure control, or using specific blood pressure medicines, compared with less intensive control, usual care, or a placebo (a dummy pill), affects:\n- developing diabetic retinopathy\n- worsening of existing retinopathy\n- vision\n- unwanted effects\n- quality of life and costs\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways to control blood pressure in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 29 randomized studies (people were placed into treatment groups by chance) from North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Together, they included 4620 people with type 1 diabetes and 22,565 people with type 2 diabetes. Some people had high blood pressure and others did not. The studies compared:\n- more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure control\n- blood pressure medicines versus usual care or placebo\n- different classes of blood pressure medicines\nStudy follow‑up ranged from less than 1 year to 9 years. Eight studies were fully funded by pharmaceutical companies, 10 were partly funded by them, 9 had other funding, and 2 did not report funding. Not all studies reported the same outcomes, and they used different blood pressure targets.\n\nMain results\n- Developing diabetic retinopathy over about 5 years: More intensive blood pressure control reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy. People with type 2 diabetes who also had high blood pressure seemed to benefit more.\n- Worsening (progression) of retinopathy: More intensive control probably makes little to no difference to worsening of retinopathy once it has started.\n- Severe eye problems (proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage): More intensive control may make little to no difference to these outcomes.\n- Vision: It is unclear if more intensive blood pressure control affects large drops in vision on a standard eye chart.\n- Unwanted effects: Deaths were probably similar between groups. Low blood pressure events may be more common with more intensive control.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident that tighter blood pressure control helps prevent new diabetic retinopathy, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure. For other outcomes, we have little confidence because the studies used different methods and blood pressure targets, followed people for different lengths of time, and many studies did not report vision, quality of life, or costs. There were few studies in people with type 1 diabetes and in people without high blood pressure. Some studies were funded by drug companies, which could influence which results were measured and reported.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.",
