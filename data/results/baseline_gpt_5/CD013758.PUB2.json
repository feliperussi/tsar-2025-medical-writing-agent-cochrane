  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo higher-protein baby formulas help or harm healthy term infants (babies born at 37 to 42 weeks) compared with standard or lower-protein formulas?\n\nKey Messages\n- We do not know if higher-protein formula changes growth problems such as underweight, short height for age (stunting), thinness (wasting), or later overweight or obesity, compared with standard-protein formula. Higher-protein and standard-protein formulas may cause a similar number of unwanted effects like diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy. No studies reported deaths.\n- We do not know if standard-protein formula changes early growth problems compared with lower-protein formula. Standard and lower-protein formulas may cause a similar number of unwanted effects in early months. No studies in this comparison reported overweight, obesity, or deaths.\n- We need more good-quality research. Some studies are ongoing or not yet fully assessed, and their results may change what we know.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is infant formula and what is protein?\nInfant formula is a manufactured milk that parents can use to feed babies. Protein is a nutrient that helps build the body, including muscles and organs. Some formulas have more protein, and some have less.\n\nWhy does protein in baby formula matter?\nIn the first year of life, babies grow fast. Some formulas include more protein to try to increase weight gain. But too much protein might raise the chance of becoming overweight later. Families and health workers want to know the balance of benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving healthy, formula-fed term infants:\n- higher-protein formula works better or worse than standard-protein formula, and\n- standard-protein formula works better or worse than lower-protein formula,\nfor growth during the first year and for later weight (overweight or obesity), and whether there are unwanted effects.\n\nHow are growth and weight problems measured?\n- Underweight means a baby’s weight is low for their age.\n- Stunting means a baby’s length or height is low for their age.\n- Wasting means a baby’s weight is low for their length or height.\n- Overweight and obesity mean too much body fat for a child’s height and age.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared higher-, standard-, and lower-protein formulas in healthy term infants. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies done in high-income countries. The studies included healthy term infants who were fed formula only, or who received formula as part of their diet, for at least 3 months. One large study followed 1090 children, and the longest follow-up in any study was 11 years. The studies compared higher-protein with standard-protein formulas, and standard-protein with lower-protein formulas. The summary we read did not state who funded the studies.\n\nHigher-protein versus standard-protein formula (first year of life)\n- It is unclear if higher-protein formula has an effect on underweight, stunting, or wasting during the first year. The results across studies did not point clearly in one direction.\n- Higher-protein formula may make little to no difference to unwanted effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy (a reaction to milk protein) in the first year.\n\nHigher-protein versus standard-protein formula (later childhood)\n- It is unclear if higher-protein formula has an effect on the chance of overweight or obesity at about 5 years of age. Only one study measured this outcome.\n\nStandard-protein versus lower-protein formula (first year of life)\n- It is unclear if standard-protein formula has an effect on underweight, stunting, or wasting during the first year.\n- Standard-protein formula may make little to no difference to unwanted effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy in the first 4 months.\n\nStandard-protein versus lower-protein formula (later outcomes)\n- No studies in this comparison reported overweight, obesity, or deaths.\n\nWhat do these results mean for families?\nBased on the studies we found, we cannot tell whether changing the protein level in formula helps or harms growth in healthy term infants. For stomach problems like diarrhea or vomiting, and for milk allergy, the different protein levels may lead to similar numbers of events. We do not have clear answers about later overweight or obesity.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies were small, and only a few measured some outcomes like later overweight or obesity. Results also varied between studies, which makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. The studies were done only in high-income countries, so the results may not reflect all settings or families. Some outcomes, such as deaths, were not reported.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
