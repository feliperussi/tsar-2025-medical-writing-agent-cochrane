  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDoes placing an abdominal drain after appendix surgery for complicated appendicitis prevent belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find clear evidence that an abdominal drain helps prevent belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess) after surgery for complicated appendicitis. A drain probably increases the chance of death within 30 days after open surgery. We are very uncertain about its effects on wound infection, overall health problems after surgery (morbidity), and length of hospital stay.\n- We did not find any studies that compared different drain types (open versus closed) or that tested removing the drain early versus late.\n- We did not find enough good‑quality evidence to answer all parts of this question. Larger, better studies are needed, with careful reporting of benefits and unwanted effects, and clear details on if and when drains are removed.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is swelling and infection of the appendix, a small tube in the lower belly. Complicated appendicitis means the appendix is dead (gangrenous) or has burst (perforated), and infection has spread in the belly. This can lead to more problems after surgery.\n\nWhat is an abdominal drain and why might it be used?\nAn abdominal drain is a tube placed in the belly during surgery to remove fluid, pus, or blood. Some surgeons use drains after appendix surgery to try to prevent belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess), which means a pocket of pus inside the belly.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if placing a drain after appendix surgery for complicated appendicitis:\n- reduces belly infections and other problems after surgery\n- has unwanted effects, including death and wound infection\n- changes how long people stay in the hospital\nWe also wanted to know if one type of drain is better than another, and the best time to remove a drain.\n\nHow is complicated appendicitis treated?\n- antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections)\n- surgery to remove the appendix by a larger cut (open surgery) or small cuts (keyhole or laparoscopic surgery)\n- some surgeons also place an abdominal drain (a tube to remove fluid) during surgery\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared drains with no drain, compared different drain types, or compared early versus late drain removal. We summarized the results across the studies and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included 739 people, both children and adults, from North America, Asia, and Africa. The studies were published between 1973 and 2023. Most people had a burst appendix with infection in the belly. Everyone received antibiotics after open or keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery. The methods of many studies had problems, and many studies were small. The abstract did not report who funded the included studies. The review itself was funded by research agencies in China.\n\nMain results\n- Belly infection (intraperitoneal abscess): We do not know if drains prevent belly infections at around 30 days. The evidence is very uncertain. For example, if about 10 of 100 people without a drain get a belly infection, about 11 of 100 with a drain may get one—but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Wound infection and overall health problems after surgery (morbidity): We do not know if drains reduce or increase wound infection or other health problems. The evidence is very uncertain.\n- Death within 30 days after open surgery: A drain probably increases the chance of death within 30 days after open appendix surgery for complicated appendicitis. Across the studies, more deaths were reported among people who received drains than among those who did not.\n- Length of hospital stay: Drains may increase the length of hospital stay slightly, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Drain type and timing: We did not find studies that compared open versus closed drains, or studies that tested removing the drain early versus late.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in most of the results because many studies were small and used methods that can affect trust in the findings. For example, people may have known which treatment they received, and some studies did not report all the outcomes we care about. The studies also involved different types of people and ways of doing surgery, which can make results vary. There were not enough studies to be certain about effects on infections and other unwanted outcomes. For the finding about death after open surgery, our confidence is only moderate because the total number of deaths was small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
