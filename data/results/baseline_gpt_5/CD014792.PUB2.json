  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nTube feeding or feeding through a vein after Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy): which helps recovery more?\n\nKey Messages\n- For adults after Whipple surgery, feeding through a tube into the small intestine (jejunostomy) probably shortens hospital stay compared with full feeding through a vein (total parenteral nutrition, TPN). Jejunostomy may make little to no difference to common complications such as leaks of pancreatic fluid and delayed stomach emptying. Deaths were similar across feeding methods, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Nasojejunal tube feeding (a thin tube from the nose into the small intestine) may make little to no difference to hospital stay and several complications compared with TPN. TPN may slightly reduce the chance of a clinically important leak of pancreatic fluid compared with nasojejunal tube feeding.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be sure about many outcomes. Future research should compare all feeding options head-to-head, use clear methods, and report results that matter to people, such as time to normal eating, complications, side effects, and length of stay.\n\nWhat is Whipple surgery and why can nutrition be a problem?\nWhipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is a major operation to remove part of the pancreas and nearby organs. It is usually done to treat cancer, but sometimes for other pancreatic problems.\n\nThis surgery changes how food moves through the digestive system. After such a big operation, many people find it hard to eat enough. Poor nutrition after surgery can slow recovery and raise the chance of problems.\n\nHow can people be fed after this surgery?\nFeeding can be given in several ways after surgery:\n- oral feeding (eating by mouth), often starting with fluids and moving to solid food\n- enteral feeding (tube feeding), where liquid nutrition goes into the gut\n  – nasojejunal tube: a thin tube from the nose into the small intestine\n  – jejunostomy tube: a tube placed through the belly into the small intestine\n- parenteral nutrition: nutrition given through a vein\n  – total parenteral nutrition (TPN): full nutrition through a vein\n  – supplemental parenteral nutrition: some nutrition through a vein along with other feeding\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which feeding method after Whipple surgery is linked with:\n- shorter hospital stay\n- fewer complications, such as leaks of pancreatic fluid (pancreatic fistula), delayed stomach emptying, or bleeding\n- better recovery overall\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022 that compared different ways of feeding adults after Whipple surgery. We summarized the results across studies and judged how confident we were in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies that involved 1897 adults. Eight studies had results that we could combine. The feeding methods, timing, and goals were quite different across studies. Most studies took place in hospital settings soon after surgery.\n\nJejunostomy tube feeding versus TPN (full feeding through a vein)\n- Hospital stay: Jejunostomy feeding probably reduces the length of hospital stay compared with TPN.\n- Pancreatic fistula (leak of pancreatic fluid): Jejunostomy feeding may make little to no difference.\n- Delayed stomach emptying and bleeding after surgery: It is unclear if jejunostomy feeding changes these outcomes; the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Serious and less serious complications (based on a grading system doctors use): Some studies did not report these outcomes for this comparison.\n\nNasojejunal tube feeding versus TPN\n- Hospital stay: Nasojejunal feeding may make little to no difference compared with TPN.\n- Delayed stomach emptying and bleeding: Nasojejunal feeding may make little to no difference compared with TPN.\n- Pancreatic fistula: TPN may slightly reduce the chance of a clinically important leak compared with nasojejunal feeding.\n- Serious and less serious complications: It is unclear if there is any difference; the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nJejunostomy tube feeding versus eating by mouth\n- Hospital stay: It is unclear if jejunostomy feeding changes the length of hospital stay compared with eating by mouth; the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Delayed stomach emptying: It is unclear if there is any difference; the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Pancreatic fistula, bleeding, and serious or less serious complications: It is unclear if there is any difference; the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nDeaths\nAcross feeding methods, deaths appeared similar, but we are very uncertain about this.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many findings because the studies were small and used different ways and timings of feeding. Some studies did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and in some cases people may have known which feeding method they received. These issues make it hard to be sure about the results and to compare studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
