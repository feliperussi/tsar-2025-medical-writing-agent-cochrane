  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs giving epidural pain relief in timed doses (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (basal infusion) during labour?\n\nKey Messages\n- Automated mandatory bolus (AMB) probably reduces breakthrough pain (pain that needs extra help from an anaesthesiologist) compared with basal infusion (BI). AMB also probably lowers the amount of numbing medicine (local anaesthetic) used. AMB probably makes little to no difference to caesarean birth, instrumental birth (use of forceps or vacuum), or how long epidural pain relief lasts. Baby health checks at birth (Apgar scores) appeared similar with both methods. Other unwanted effects were not reported.\n- Findings about mothers’ satisfaction with pain relief were mixed, but AMB may increase satisfaction. The difference in anaesthetic use between AMB and BI varied depending on the epidural technique used (epidural alone versus combined spinal–epidural).\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to be sure about effects on mode of birth and other unwanted effects. Future studies should be larger, report unwanted effects clearly, measure satisfaction in the same way, and look at costs.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief in labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to control pain during labour and birth. A thin tube is placed into the space near the spine (the epidural space). Numbing medicines called local anaesthetics (LAs) block pain signals in the belly, pelvis, and perineum. Strong pain medicines called opioids are sometimes added to improve pain relief.\n\nHow can epidural medicines be given?\nThere are 2 main ways to keep epidural pain relief going:\n- Basal infusion (BI): medicines flow in a steady, continuous drip.\n- Automated mandatory bolus (AMB): medicines are given as set doses at fixed times by a machine.\nPeople can also use patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). This lets you press a button to give yourself an extra dose when you need it.\n\nWhy does the way we give epidural medicines matter?\nA better method should lead to fewer episodes of breakthrough pain that need an anaesthesiologist to step in. It should also avoid unwanted effects, such as more caesarean births, more instrumental births, longer time needing pain relief, or higher use of anaesthetic medicine. Baby health checks at birth are also important. An Apgar score is a quick test at 1 and 5 minutes after birth to see how well the baby is doing.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether AMB or BI works better to maintain epidural pain relief in women at term. We looked at breakthrough pain, caesarean and instrumental birth, how long pain relief was needed, how much anaesthetic medicine was used, mothers’ satisfaction, and babies’ Apgar scores.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared AMB with BI for epidurals in labour. We summarized their results and judged how confident we are in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies involving 4590 women at term. Most studies included women having their first baby (nulliparous). Women with preterm or complicated pregnancies were not included. The way epidurals were started differed: some used combined spinal–epidural (CSE), some used epidural only, and one used dural puncture epidural (DPE). Medicines also varied; studies used different local anaesthetics (such as ropivacaine, bupivacaine, or levobupivacaine) and different opioids (such as fentanyl or sufentanil). The abstract did not state where the studies took place or who funded them. Many studies appeared to have good methods, but in some, how treatment assignment was hidden was unclear.\n\nMain results:\n- Breakthrough pain: AMB probably reduces the chance that women will have breakthrough pain that needs help from an anaesthesiologist.\n- Amount of anaesthetic used: AMB probably reduces the amount of local anaesthetic needed each hour.\n- Mode of birth: AMB probably makes little to no difference to whether birth is by caesarean or needs instruments like forceps or vacuum.\n- Duration of epidural pain relief: AMB probably makes little to no difference to how long women need epidural pain relief.\n- Mothers’ satisfaction: AMB may increase satisfaction, but studies measured satisfaction in different ways, and results were mixed.\n- Baby outcomes: AMB may make little to no difference to babies’ Apgar scores.\n- Subgroups: Differences in anaesthetic use between AMB and BI varied when comparing epidural alone versus combined spinal–epidural. Using PCEA or whether women were first‑time mothers did not clearly change the main results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings on breakthrough pain and anaesthetic use. However, our confidence is lower for other outcomes because:\n- Some studies may not have fully kept treatment assignment hidden, which can affect results.\n- Studies used different epidural techniques and medicine mixes, which can make results vary.\n- There may not be enough large studies to be sure about effects on caesarean and instrumental birth.\n- Mothers’ satisfaction and baby Apgar scores were measured in different ways and at different times, so results were not combined.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
