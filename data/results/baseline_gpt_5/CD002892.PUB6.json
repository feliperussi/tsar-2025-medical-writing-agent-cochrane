  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo stress‑reduction programs for individual healthcare workers help reduce stress and are there any harms?\n\nKey Messages\n- Individual programs to reduce stress may help healthcare workers feel less stressed in the short term and up to about 1 year after the program ends. We found very little information about unwanted effects (harms), so we do not know if these programs cause any problems.\n- Programs that help people focus on and change their thoughts, feelings, and actions about stress, and programs that shift attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise), may both reduce stress. Programs that combine several methods may also help in the short term. We do not know which type works best. It is unclear whether programs that try to change work‑related factors for an individual worker help.\n- Future research needs to use better study methods, include more people, compare program types directly, measure long‑term effects, and report any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is work‑related stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare work can be fast, complex, and emotionally demanding. When the demands are higher than a person’s skills or support at work, stress can build up. This can lead to burnout (feeling emotionally exhausted and unable to cope), sleep problems, and physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. Stress can also affect the quality of care.\n\nWhy might stress‑reduction programs help?\nStress‑reduction programs aim to lower stress symptoms. Some teach skills to notice and change unhelpful thoughts, feelings, and actions. Some aim to relax the body and mind or provide a mental break from stress. Others try to improve how an individual manages work‑related challenges. Some programs combine several of these ideas.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether programs given to individual healthcare workers reduce stress symptoms compared with no program, being on a waiting list, a neutral activity not aimed at stress, or a different type of stress program. We also looked for any unwanted effects.\n\n[Optional] How can stress be reduced?\n- Programs that change how you respond to stress (for example, mindfulness, which trains attention and awareness; and talking‑based methods that teach coping skills)\n- Programs that shift attention away from stress (for example, relaxation, breathing exercises, music, or physical exercise)\n- Programs that change work‑related factors for an individual (for example, time‑management or communication skills)\n- Programs that combine two or more of the above approaches\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies where individual healthcare workers were randomly placed into different groups (to make the groups similar). We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that included 11,119 healthcare workers. All studies measured stress using questionnaires. Researchers checked effects soon after programs ended (up to 3 months), in the medium term (more than 3 to 12 months), and in the long term (more than 12 months). Many studies were small. The abstract did not report where the studies took place or who funded them.\n\nMain results\n- Programs that focus on the experience of stress (changing thoughts, feelings, and actions):\nThese programs may reduce stress symptoms in the short term. They may also reduce stress in the medium term, up to about 1 year after the program ends. We do not know if benefits last longer than 1 year because very few studies checked this.\n\n- Programs that focus attention away from stress (relaxation, exercise, and similar):\nThese programs may reduce stress symptoms in the short term. They may also reduce stress in the medium term. No studies reported what happened beyond 1 year.\n\n- Programs that try to change work‑related factors for an individual worker:\nIt is unclear if these programs help in the short term, medium term, or long term. There were few and small studies, and the results varied.\n\n- Programs that combine several methods:\nThese programs may reduce stress symptoms in the short term. In the medium term, they may reduce stress, but it is also possible they make little to no difference. We do not know about long‑term effects.\n\n- Which type works best?\nVery few studies directly compared different types. It is unclear whether focusing on stress, focusing away from stress, or combining methods works better.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, and people knew which program they received. Many studies did not clearly describe how people were put into groups or register their plans in advance. Few studies followed people for longer than 1 year, and most did not report unwanted effects. These issues make it hard to be sure about the size and duration of benefits, or about harms.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
