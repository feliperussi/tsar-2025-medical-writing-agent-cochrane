  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nWhat are the benefits and risks of gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues; medicines that lower hormone levels) for endometriosis?\n\nKey Messages\n- GnRH analogues may reduce endometriosis pain slightly compared with placebo (no active treatment) and with some progestogen medicines (hormone treatments). They may also cause more unwanted effects, such as hot flushes, and may reduce bone strength (bone mineral density).\n- We do not know if GnRH analogues work better or worse than danazol, intra‑uterine progestogens, or gestrinone for pain relief. GnRH analogues alone may reduce bone strength more than when combined with calcium‑regulating medicines (medicines that help keep calcium levels and protect bones).\n- We did not find enough good‑quality evidence to be certain about many results. Future studies should be larger, use clear and consistent ways to measure pain and quality of life, follow people for longer, and report bone health and side effects carefully.\n\nWhat is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is when tissue similar to the lining inside the womb grows outside the womb. It can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), pelvic pain, and sometimes trouble getting pregnant. It can affect daily life, relationships, and work.\n\nHow is endometriosis usually treated?\nPeople may use:\n- pain‑relief medicines (analgesics)\n- hormone treatments, such as progestogens (hormones similar to progesterone), danazol, or gestrinone\n- GnRH analogues (medicines that lower certain hormones, often estrogen)\n- surgery to remove or destroy endometriosis tissue\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if GnRH analogues help reduce endometriosis pain and improve quality of life. We also wanted to know how they affect bone strength (bone mineral density) and what unwanted effects they cause.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared GnRH analogues with other treatments or with placebo. We summarized the results across studies, and we judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 72 studies that included 7355 women with endometriosis. The studies compared GnRH analogues with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, and gestrinone. Some studies also looked at giving GnRH analogues with “add‑back” or bone‑protecting medicines, such as calcium‑regulating medicines. Many pain results were reported after about 3 months of treatment. Bone strength was sometimes measured after longer periods, for example 12 months.\n\nWe did not find studies comparing GnRH analogues with no treatment, or with simple pain‑relief medicines alone. We did not find reliable studies comparing GnRH analogues with intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\nPain compared with placebo:\n- GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex, and pelvic tenderness slightly after about 3 months compared with placebo.\n- GnRH analogues may cause more hot flushes than placebo.\n\nPain compared with danazol:\n- We do not know if GnRH analogues reduce pain compared with danazol. For some measures after about 6 months, they may reduce pain slightly, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nPain compared with oral or injectable progestogens:\n- GnRH analogues may reduce overall pain slightly compared with oral or injectable progestogens.\n\nPain compared with intra‑uterine progestogens or gestrinone:\n- We are uncertain whether GnRH analogues make a difference compared with intra‑uterine progestogens or compared with gestrinone.\n\nBone strength (bone mineral density):\n- GnRH analogues may reduce bone strength slightly compared with gestrinone.\n- GnRH analogues used alone may reduce bone strength more than GnRH analogues given together with calcium‑regulating medicines. In other words, adding bone‑protecting medicines may help limit bone loss.\n\nUnwanted effects:\n- GnRH analogues may increase unwanted effects compared with placebo or with gestrinone. Hot flushes were a common complaint. The studies did not always report other side effects clearly.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many findings because many studies did not describe their methods clearly, and the studies were small. Different studies measured pain and other outcomes in different ways, which made results hard to compare. For several comparisons, there were few studies, and follow‑up times were short. These issues mean the true effects could be different from what we report here.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022.",
