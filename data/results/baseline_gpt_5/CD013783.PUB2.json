  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nAre toe–brachial index (toe-to-arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) accurate for diagnosing peripheral artery disease (PAD)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to know how accurate toe–brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are for diagnosing PAD. These toe tests are non-invasive, and unwanted effects were not reported.\n- We could not tell whether TBI or TSBP is more accurate. We also could not tell how well they work in specific groups, such as people with diabetes or kidney disease.\n- Future research should use clear methods, consistent imaging tests, and agreed “cut-off” points (the numbers that decide when a test is positive). This will help us understand how well these toe tests diagnose PAD.\n\nWhat is peripheral artery disease (PAD)?\nPAD stands for peripheral artery disease. It is a long-term problem where arteries in the legs become narrow or blocked by fatty buildup. This reduces blood flow to the legs. PAD is common and can cause leg pain when walking (called claudication), pain at rest, wounds that do not heal, or even tissue death and amputation. PAD also raises the risk of heart attack and stroke. Finding PAD early can help doctors manage risk and prevent complications.\n\nWhat are toe tests (toe–brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure)?\nToe–brachial index (TBI) compares blood pressure in the big toe to blood pressure in the arm. In other words, it is a ratio of toe pressure divided by arm pressure. A lower ratio suggests worse blood flow to the toe.\nToe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) is the blood pressure measured directly at the toe using a small cuff and sensors.\nBoth tests are done at the bedside. They do not involve needles or surgery. Different devices can be used to measure these pressures.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out:\n- How accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing PAD, using different cut-off points (the values used to call the test positive).\n- Whether TBI or TSBP is more accurate.\nWe also looked at whether accuracy changes by patient group (for example, people with diabetes or kidney disease), by equipment used, by cut-off point, and by the imaging test used as the “gold standard” comparison.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to February 2024 that measured TBI or TSBP and also used vascular imaging to confirm PAD. We summarized the results and judged how much confidence we could have in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies. Thirteen studies assessed TBI only, 1 assessed TSBP only, and 4 assessed both tests. In total, 1927 people (2550 limbs) had TBI measured, and 701 people (701 limbs) had TSBP measured.\nTo check for PAD, studies compared toe test results with imaging tests such as:\n- Ultrasound scans of leg arteries (colour duplex ultrasound)\n- CT angiography (a special X-ray scan with dye to show arteries)\n- Angiography (a dye test that outlines arteries using X-rays)\n- Multi-detector CT (a type of CT scan)\nThe studies used different devices to take toe pressure readings and used different cut-off points to decide when a test was “positive.”\nOverall, the studies were not strong enough to answer our questions clearly. Many studies did not report how people were chosen, whether the imaging experts knew the toe test results, or whether the toe tests and imaging were done close together in time. The number of studies for TSBP was small.\nBecause of these issues, we do not know how accurate TBI or TSBP are for diagnosing PAD. We also do not know which toe test is more accurate. In simple terms, it is unclear how well these toe tests identify PAD when compared to imaging tests.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because:\n- Many studies did not explain how people entered the study. This can make groups different in ways that affect results.\n- It was often unclear whether the person interpreting the imaging knew the toe test result. This can influence judgments.\n- The timing between toe tests and imaging was not always reported, so the person’s condition could have changed.\n- Studies used different imaging tests, devices, and cut-off points, making results hard to compare.\n- There were not enough studies for some questions, especially for TSBP and for specific groups such as people with diabetes or kidney disease.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
