  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo mental health prevention programs led by primary care and community workers (trained health workers who are not mental health specialists) help people in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKey Messages\n- Programs delivered by primary care and community workers may give small benefits for mental health compared with usual care (the standard help people normally get). In adults, these programs probably reduce anxiety slightly and may reduce distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD; ongoing stress after a scary or harmful event) symptoms. In children, they may improve quality of life, and may slightly reduce depression and anxiety. Unwanted effects or harms (adverse events) were rarely reported; in the few studies that did report them, programs did not increase harms and may have reduced them.\n- The benefits seen were generally small and were measured soon after the program ended. Results differed between studies, and not all important outcomes, such as costs, were reported.\n- Future studies should measure results over longer periods, report harms and costs clearly, and compare different program types in different groups of people to find what works best.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat are mental health prevention and promotion programs?\nMental health promotion aims to help people feel and function well. Prevention aims to stop mental health problems from starting or getting worse. There are 3 types:\n- Universal programs: offered to everyone in a community, school, or clinic.\n- Selective programs: offered to people at higher risk of mental health problems.\n- Indicated programs: offered to people who already have early symptoms.\n\nWho are primary care and community workers?\nPrimary care health workers work in basic health services, like local clinics. Community workers include health volunteers, lay counselors, or other trained helpers. They are trained to deliver simple mental health programs, such as psychoeducation, problem-solving, or group support. This approach can increase access where there are few mental health specialists.\n\nWhy might these programs be useful in low- and middle-income countries?\nIn many places, there are not enough mental health specialists. Stigma and costs can also stop people from getting help. Training primary care and community workers to deliver programs could reach more people earlier and closer to home.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs led by primary care or community workers can:\n- promote well-being and prevent mental health problems in adults and children\n- reduce symptoms like anxiety, depression, and distress/PTSD\n- improve daily functioning and quality of life\n- avoid harms and make good use of resources and costs\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies from around the world that compared these programs with usual care or no program. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 113 studies with 32,992 people from many low- and middle-income countries. Most studies were with adults (83 studies), and 30 studies were with children. Programs were delivered by primary care health workers, community workers, or both. Some programs were universal (22 studies), some were selective (36 studies), and some were indicated for people with early symptoms (55 studies). Most studies compared programs with usual care. The studies took place across countries with different income levels, from low-income to upper-middle-income settings. The abstract did not report who funded the studies or how long they lasted. Many results were measured right after the program ended.\n\nMain results\nAdults\n- Universal promotion/prevention versus usual care: These programs probably reduce anxiety slightly. They may also slightly reduce distress/PTSD symptoms.\n- Selective prevention versus usual care: These programs probably slightly reduce depressive symptoms.\n- Indicated prevention versus usual care: These programs may reduce harms. They probably reduce problems with daily functioning slightly (functional impairment means trouble doing everyday tasks at home, school, or work).\n\nChildren\n- Universal promotion/prevention versus usual care: These programs may improve quality of life. They may also reduce harms. They may slightly reduce depression and anxiety.\n- Selective prevention versus usual care: These programs probably slightly reduce depressive symptoms. They may slightly reduce anxiety. They probably slightly reduce distress/PTSD symptoms.\n- Indicated prevention versus usual care: These programs slightly reduce problems with daily functioning and slightly reduce depressive symptoms. They may slightly reduce distress/PTSD symptoms.\n\nHow should you think about these findings in daily life?\nThe benefits seen were small. This means some people may feel a little better or cope a bit more easily, especially right after the program. We do not know how long these benefits last. Programs did not appear to increase harms in the few studies that reported them.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in some findings, and less confident in others, for these reasons:\n- Many studies were small, and results were measured only in the short term.\n- People and staff may have known which program they received, which can affect how people report their symptoms.\n- Not all studies reported all outcomes we care about, such as harms and costs.\n- The programs and people in the studies were quite different, so results varied between studies.\n- Information about resource use and costs was not provided in the abstract, so we cannot say how these programs affect costs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",
