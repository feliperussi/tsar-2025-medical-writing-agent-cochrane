  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo medicines taken by mouth help prevent vertigo attacks in Ménière’s disease (repeated dizziness with hearing loss and ringing in the ears)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found too little good-quality evidence to know whether medicines taken by mouth—betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, or corticosteroids—reduce vertigo attacks or improve symptoms in adults with Ménière’s disease. Serious harms were rarely measured, so we cannot tell how safe these medicines are.\n- The studies were small and used different ways and times to measure vertigo, so we could not compare results well. We found no studies on antihistamines (medicines that block histamine).\n- Future research should run larger, better-designed studies that agree on what to measure, follow people for longer, and record both benefits and harms so we can understand how well these medicines work and how safe they are.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease?\nMénière’s disease causes repeated attacks of vertigo, which is a strong spinning feeling that can make you feel sick or unsteady. Many people also have hearing loss and tinnitus, which means hearing ringing, buzzing, or roaring sounds. These symptoms can be unpredictable and can disrupt daily life, work, and sleep.\n\nWhy might medicines help?\nDoctors use several types of medicines for Ménière’s disease. These include:\n- betahistine (a medicine used to ease balance symptoms),\n- diuretics (medicines that help the body get rid of extra salt and water),\n- antivirals (medicines that fight viruses),\n- corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation).\nSystemic medicines are medicines taken by mouth or by injection that work throughout the whole body, not just in one spot. The exact cause of Ménière’s disease is not known, and it is also unclear how these medicines might help.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if systemic medicines help people with Ménière’s disease by:\n- reducing the number or severity of vertigo attacks,\n- improving health-related quality of life,\n- affecting hearing or tinnitus,\n- and whether they cause serious or other unwanted effects.\nWe compared these medicines with placebo (a dummy medicine) or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with Ménière’s disease, summarized their results, and judged how much confidence we could have in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies with 848 adults who had definite or probable Ménière’s disease. All studies followed people for at least 3 months. The studies looked at betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. We did not find any studies on antihistamines.\n\nBetahistine was assessed in 7 studies that included 548 people. Different studies measured vertigo in different ways and at different times, and most did not report all the outcomes we were interested in. Only 1 study reported serious harms. Because of these differences, we could not combine the results in a meaningful way. It is unclear if betahistine reduces vertigo attacks or changes vertigo severity.\n\nDiuretics were assessed in 2 studies. One study tested isosorbide in 220 people. The other tested a combination of amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in 80 people. Each study reported different outcomes at different times, and neither study reported serious harms. It is unclear if diuretics reduce vertigo attacks or change vertigo severity.\n\nAntivirals were assessed in 1 small study with 24 people, and corticosteroids were assessed in 1 small study with 16 people. These studies did not report serious harms. It is unclear if antivirals or corticosteroids reduce vertigo attacks or improve symptoms.\n\nAcross all medicines, we often could not tell whether there was any benefit because the studies were small, measured vertigo differently, and used different follow-up times. Harms were rarely measured or reported, so safety is also unclear. We also could not tell whether these medicines affect hearing, tinnitus, or quality of life, because those outcomes were not consistently reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there were few studies and many were small. The studies used different ways and times to measure vertigo, so results were hard to compare. Many studies did not report all the outcomes we care about, especially serious harms. Because of this, we could not draw clear conclusions about benefits or safety.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
