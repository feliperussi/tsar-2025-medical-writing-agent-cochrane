  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nIs entecavir (an antiviral medicine) helpful and safe for people with chronic hepatitis B (a long‑lasting liver infection)?\n\nKey Messages\n- We could not tell if entecavir changes the chance of dying or having serious side effects compared with no treatment or placebo. No deaths happened during the study follow‑up, and the studies did not report on quality of life.\n- Most studies included adults and lasted from a few weeks to about 4 years. Only 1 study included only children. This means the findings may not apply to all people, especially children.\n- We did not find enough good‑quality evidence to answer the key questions. Future research should be larger, include children and adults, follow people for longer, and measure outcomes that matter to people, such as survival, quality of life, and serious side effects.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B?\nChronic hepatitis B is a long‑lasting infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. It can damage the liver over time and may lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. Many people with chronic hepatitis B feel well for years, but the infection can still harm the liver.\n\nWhat is entecavir?\nEntecavir is an antiviral medicine. Antiviral medicines help block viruses from making more copies of themselves. Doctors often use entecavir as a first‑line treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Some people with hepatitis B have a protein in their blood called hepatitis B e‑antigen (HBeAg). HBeAg can show that the virus is active. This review looked at people who were HBeAg‑positive and HBeAg‑negative.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether entecavir helps people with chronic hepatitis B live longer, feel better, and avoid serious side effects, compared with no treatment or a placebo (a dummy pill). We focused on deaths from any cause, health‑related quality of life, and serious side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared entecavir with no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. We summarized the results across the studies and judged how much confidence we could place in the findings, based on study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 22 studies that included 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies were published between 2005 and 2022. People took entecavir as a tablet. Follow‑up ranged from 5 weeks to 228 weeks. In 12 studies, entecavir was compared with no treatment. In 10 studies, it was compared with a placebo. In 14 studies, other treatments were given equally to both groups. Nineteen studies included only adults. One study included only children. One study included people aged 14 to 55 years. One study did not report ages. The review itself had no dedicated funding. The studies did not consistently report who funded them.\n\nMain results:\n- Deaths: We do not know if entecavir reduces deaths compared with no treatment or placebo. No deaths happened during follow‑up in the studies that reported this outcome. Follow‑up was usually less than 2 years.\n- Quality of life: No study reported health‑related quality of life. We do not know whether entecavir helps people feel better in daily life.\n- Serious side effects: It is unclear if entecavir changes the chance of serious side effects compared with no treatment or placebo. We are very uncertain about these results. Follow‑up for this outcome was usually about 1 year.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies used methods that may introduce bias. For example, people may have known which treatment they received, and some outcomes were not reported. There were very few events, which makes it hard to tell if entecavir has an effect. Many studies were small and did not follow people for long. There was little information about children, and no study reported quality of life.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
