  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title\nDo strengthening exercises help patellar tendinopathy (pain at the front of the knee), and are there risks?\n\nKey Messages\n- Based on a few small studies in athletes, we do not know if strengthening exercises reduce pain compared with no treatment. Compared with steroid injections (glucocorticoid), strengthening exercises may make little or no difference to pain or function. Compared with surgery, we do not know if exercises improve pain or function, and they may make little or no difference to treatment success or returning to sport. No studies reported harmful effects.\n- All people in the studies were athletes, mostly young men with long‑lasting symptoms. No study used a placebo or sham exercise. Because of this, and because the studies were small, we cannot be sure how well strengthening exercises work or whether the results apply to non‑athletes.\n- Future research should include larger, better‑designed studies with athletes and non‑athletes. Studies should compare different types of strengthening (eccentric [lengthening], concentric [shortening], and isometric [holding still]), include placebo or sham groups, follow people for longer, and report unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy?\nPatellar tendinopathy is long‑lasting pain and tenderness at the front of the knee, where the tendon under the kneecap attaches to the shinbone. It can make it hard to run, jump, climb stairs, or play sports. It is common in people who take part in jumping or running sports, but it can affect others too.\n\nHow might exercise help?\nMany people use exercise to treat patellar tendinopathy. Strengthening exercises aim to make the muscles and tendon stronger. Types include:\n- eccentric exercises (lengthening the muscle while it works)\n- concentric exercises (shortening the muscle while it works)\n- isometric exercises (holding the muscle still while it works)\nPeople may also do stretching. Exercises can be done on land or in water, and can be weight‑bearing or non‑weight‑bearing. Other treatments include surgery and steroid injections (glucocorticoids).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if strengthening exercises help people with patellar tendinopathy with:\n- pain, knee function, and quality of life\n- feeling that the treatment worked\n- returning to sport\n- unwanted effects (harms)\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared strengthening exercises with no treatment or other treatments. We summarized the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence, based on study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that included 211 people with chronic (long‑lasting) patellar tendinopathy. All studies included athletes; most were men (about 88%), with an average age of 26 years and symptoms that had lasted for many months. Three studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment. One compared exercises with steroid injections (glucocorticoid). One compared exercises with surgery. One compared exercises with stretching, and one compared exercises with pulsed ultrasound plus transverse friction massage. We did not find any studies that used a placebo or sham exercise. One study reported 12‑month results after surgery; most others reported outcomes at the end of treatment. The abstract did not state which countries the studies took place in or who funded them.\n\nMain results:\n- Strengthening exercises versus no treatment: It is unclear if strengthening exercises reduce pain compared with no treatment. Strengthening exercises may make little or no difference to knee function compared with no treatment at the end of treatment. The studies did not report quality of life, return to sport, treatment success, or unwanted effects for this comparison.\n- Strengthening exercises versus steroid injections (glucocorticoid): Strengthening exercises may make little or no difference to pain or function at the end of treatment. The study did not report quality of life, return to sport, treatment success, or unwanted effects.\n- Strengthening exercises versus surgery: It is unclear if strengthening exercises reduce pain or improve function compared with surgery. Strengthening exercises may make little or no difference to people’s rating of treatment success or to returning to sport about 12 months later. The study did not report quality of life or unwanted effects.\n- Strengthening exercises versus stretching, and versus pulsed ultrasound plus transverse friction massage: One study compared each of these, but the abstract did not provide results for our main outcomes (pain, function, treatment success, return to sport, quality of life, or unwanted effects), so we could not judge these comparisons.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were small and had problems with how they were done. In some studies, we are not sure if people were truly placed into groups at random or if the group assignments were kept hidden at the start. People and researchers knew which treatment they received. Some studies did not report all the outcomes we were interested in, and many people dropped out. Also, all studies included only athletes, mostly young men. This means the findings may not apply to non‑athletes or to women. No study reported unwanted effects, so we do not know about harms.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
