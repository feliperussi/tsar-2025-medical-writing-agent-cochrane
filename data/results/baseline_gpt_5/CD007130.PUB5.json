Up to 12 months, home-based care may make little to no difference to deaths, fitness, and quality of life compared with centre-based care. Harms and unwanted effects were not well reported.\n- People in home-based and centre-based programs may be just as likely to finish their program, and the cost per person may be similar.\n- We need better and longer studies that report safety clearly, compare results beyond 12 months, and include other heart problems such as after valve surgery or atrial fibrillation.\n\nWhat is cardiac rehabilitation?\nCardiac rehabilitation is a plan that helps you recover after a heart problem. It usually includes supervised exercise, education about heart health, and support to change lifestyle, such as stopping smoking and eating well. The goal is to help you feel better, get fitter, and lower your chance of future heart problems.\n\nWhy consider home-based rehabilitation?\nMany people find it hard to travel to hospital or community centres several times a week. Home-based programs, sometimes using phone, video, apps, or other digital tools (telehealth), may make it easier to join and stay in care. This became especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, when face-to-face services were limited.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation works better, worse, or about the same as supervised centre-based programs. We looked at deaths, illness, fitness, quality of life, and common heart risk factors.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for and compared studies that looked at home-based versus centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart disease. We combined the results and rated how confident we are in the findings, based on how the studies were done and their sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies with 3046 people. The studies included adults who had a recent heart attack (also called acute myocardial infarction, which means a sudden blockage of blood flow to the heart), heart failure (a long-term condition where the heart cannot pump blood well), or procedures to restore blood flow to the heart (revascularisation, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery). Programs took place in hospitals or community centres for the centre-based groups, and at home for the home-based groups, sometimes with phone or online support. Most studies lasted up to 12 months, and only 3 reported results beyond 12 months. The studies were done in different places, but the abstract did not report funding sources. We also found 9 studies waiting to be assessed and 14 ongoing studies, which were not included in the results.\n\nMain results:\n- Deaths up to 12 months: Home-based cardiac rehabilitation may make little to no difference to the chance of dying compared with centre-based care. We have little confidence in this finding.\n- Fitness (exercise capacity) up to 12 months: Home-based cardiac rehabilitation may make little to no difference to fitness compared with centre-based care. We have little confidence in this finding.\n- Fitness beyond 12 months: Home-based cardiac rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to fitness compared with centre-based care.\n- Health-related quality of life up to 24 months: Most studies found little to no difference between home-based and centre-based care.\n- Completing the program: People in home-based and centre-based programs may be just as likely to finish their program.\n- Costs: The cost per person for home-based and centre-based programs was similar.\n\nWhat do these findings mean for you?\nIf you need cardiac rehabilitation, you may have a choice between going to a centre or doing a supervised program from home. Based on current studies, both approaches may lead to similar results in the short term. Home-based programs may be helpful if travel or schedules make centre visits hard. However, we found little information about unwanted effects or safety, and we need more long-term results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some findings because many studies did not report enough details about how people were assigned to groups or whether the people measuring outcomes knew which group patients were in. The studies were generally small and short, and only a few reported results beyond 12 months. The evidence does not cover all heart conditions, such as after valve surgery or atrial fibrillation. Some studies are still ongoing or awaiting assessment, so newer results were not included yet.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
