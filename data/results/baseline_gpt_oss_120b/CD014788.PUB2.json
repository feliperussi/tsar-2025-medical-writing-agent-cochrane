  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs using gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) helpful for pain and safe for bones in women with endometriosis?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- GnRHa may lower pelvic pain and painful periods in women with endometriosis, but the evidence is low‑certainty and comes from only a few small studies.  \n- GnRHa may cause more hot‑flushes (sudden feelings of heat) and may lead to a small loss of bone density, especially when not combined with calcium‑supporting medicines.  \n- Because the current research is limited and uncertain, more well‑designed studies are needed to confirm how well GnRHa work and how they affect bone health.  \n\nWhat is endometriosis and why does it matter?  \nEndometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. The tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain, and can make it harder to become pregnant.  \n\nWhat treatments are usually tried?  \nDoctors often start with pain‑relieving medicines or hormonal pills that thin the uterine lining. When these do not give enough relief, some doctors prescribe gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa). GnRHa are medicines that temporarily switch off the hormones that make the endometrial tissue grow, which can reduce pain but may also affect bone strength.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether GnRHa reduce pain and improve quality of life for women with endometriosis, and whether they cause any problems for bone health or other side‑effects compared with other treatments or with no treatment.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared GnRHa with other hormonal medicines, placebo, or no treatment. We combined the findings from those studies and judged how confident we could be in the results based on how the studies were done.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 72 studies that together included 7 355 women with endometriosis. Most studies were small and had unclear methods, so the overall confidence in the evidence is low. The studies were carried out in many countries and looked at GnRHa alone or GnRHa used together with calcium‑supporting agents.  \n\nWhen GnRHa were compared with placebo, the evidence (low certainty) suggests that GnRHa may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, and pain during sex after about three months of treatment. The same evidence also suggests that GnRHa may increase the chance of experiencing hot‑flushes.  \n\nWhen GnRHa were compared with other hormonal medicines such as danazol or progestogen pills, the evidence was very uncertain, and we could not tell whether pain improved or not.  \n\nWhen GnRHa were used without calcium‑supporting medicines, the evidence (very low certainty) suggests a small loss of bone density after about a year of treatment. Adding calcium‑supporting agents appeared to protect bone density better.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small and did not clearly describe how they were carried out. This makes it hard to know whether the results are reliable.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022.  ",
