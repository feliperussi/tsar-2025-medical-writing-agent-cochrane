  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs physical exercise helpful for people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) that has not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey Messages  \n- We cannot tell if exercise helps or harms people with non‑ulcerated CVI; the few studies that exist did not show clear benefits and did not report any harms.  \n- The studies used different types of exercise, were small, and had methodological problems, so the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- More large, well‑designed research is needed to find out whether exercise can improve symptoms, quality of life, or other outcomes for this condition.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?  \nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs have trouble sending blood back to the heart. This can cause swelling, aching, heaviness, and may eventually lead to painful leg ulcers. People with CVI often have a lower quality of life because the symptoms make everyday activities harder.\n\nWhat are physical‑exercise programmes?  \nPhysical‑exercise programmes are planned sets of activities such as walking, calf‑raising, or resistance training that are done regularly to strengthen leg muscles and improve blood flow. The idea is that stronger muscles might help push blood upward and reduce CVI symptoms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether regular, structured exercise programmes improve the signs and symptoms of CVI, prevent leg ulcers, and affect quality of life, muscle strength, walking ability, and ankle movement, compared with doing no structured exercise.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared an exercise programme with no exercise in people who have non‑ulcerated CVI. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found five studies that together included 146 people with CVI. The studies were carried out in different countries and each used its own type of exercise programme (different activities, frequencies, and lengths). One study was judged to have low risk of bias, three had unclear risk, and one had high risk of bias. Because the studies measured outcomes in different ways, we could not pool the data into a single analysis.\n\nMain results  \nBecause the certainty of the evidence was very low, we are uncertain about all outcomes. In plain language:\n\n- It is unclear if exercise changes how severe the CVI signs and symptoms are.  \n- It is unclear if exercise improves the amount of blood the leg veins can pump (ejection fraction).  \n- It is unclear if exercise speeds up the time it takes for blood to refill the veins after being emptied (venous refilling time).  \n- No study reported whether exercise prevented leg ulcers, so we have no information on that outcome.  \n- It is unclear if exercise improves health‑related quality of life.  \n- It is unclear if exercise makes people able to walk longer on a treadmill or cover more distance in a six‑minute walk test.  \n- It is unclear if exercise increases muscle strength in the lower leg.  \n- It is unclear if exercise improves ankle joint movement.\n\nNo harms were reported in any of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
