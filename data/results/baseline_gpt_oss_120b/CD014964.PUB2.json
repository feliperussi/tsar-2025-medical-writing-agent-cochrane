  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs using ultrasound (sound‑wave imaging) better than feeling for landmarks when giving neuraxial anaesthesia to adults?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Using ultrasound to guide neuraxial anaesthesia reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the time needed for the procedure, and it probably increases the chance of getting it right on the first try. The evidence does not show a clear change in how much pain people feel, how satisfied they are, or the risk of side‑effects.  \n- The findings about fewer attempts, shorter time, and higher first‑try success are based on solid evidence, but the results for pain, satisfaction and side‑effects come from weaker evidence because the studies were small or varied.  \n- More research is needed that looks closely at pain, patient satisfaction and any possible harms, using larger and well‑designed studies.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia and why might it be hard?  \nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain‑blocking medicine that is injected near the spinal cord to numb the lower part of the body for surgery or childbirth. Doctors usually find the right spot by feeling the shape of the back (anatomical landmarks). Because the spine’s exact position can differ from what is felt on the surface, the needle may need several tries, which can increase discomfort and the chance of complications.\n\nWhy could ultrasound help?  \nUltrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the spine inside the back. Seeing the exact location on a screen may let the doctor aim the needle more accurately, potentially needing fewer attempts and less time.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare ultrasound guidance with the traditional “feel‑for‑landmarks” method to see which approach works better and is safer for adults needing neuraxial anaesthesia.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared ultrasound with the landmark method in adults. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 65 studies that together included 6 823 adults. The studies were carried out in many countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania between 2001 and 2023. About half of the studies involved people receiving epidural or combined spinal‑epidural anaesthesia for labour or caesarean delivery, and the rest involved various types of spinal or epidural anaesthesia for surgery. A few studies used real‑time ultrasound while most used a pre‑procedure scan.\n\nThe main results were:  \n\n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts slightly.  \n- Ultrasound guidance reduces the time needed for the needle procedure.  \n- Ultrasound guidance probably increases the chance of success on the first attempt.  \n- Ultrasound guidance may make little or no difference to how satisfied people feel about the procedure.  \n- Ultrasound guidance may make little or no difference to the chance of a technical failure (the procedure not working).  \n- It is unclear if ultrasound guidance reduces the pain felt during the procedure.  \n- It is unclear if ultrasound guidance changes the risk of any side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are confident about the findings on fewer attempts and shorter time because many well‑conducted studies looked at these outcomes. Our confidence in the first‑try success is only moderate because the studies varied in how they were done. We have little confidence in the results for satisfaction and technical failure because the studies were small and used different ways to measure these outcomes. We are not confident about the effects on pain and side‑effects because only a few small studies examined them.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",
