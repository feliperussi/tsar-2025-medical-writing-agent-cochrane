  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs in‑vitro maturation (IVM) better than standard IVF for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- IVM may increase the chance of miscarriage slightly, but it greatly lowers the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS); we are unsure whether IVM changes the overall chance of having a baby.  \n- The evidence about live‑birth rates is very uncertain because the studies were few, small, and some had design problems.  \n- More well‑designed trials are needed to find out if IVM truly improves outcomes for women with PCOS and to confirm its safety.\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?  \nWomen with PCOS often need assisted reproduction. In standard IVF the medicines used to stimulate the ovaries can cause an exaggerated response, leading to many immature eggs and a risk of OHSS. One way to avoid this is to collect immature eggs early and let them mature in the laboratory – a process called in‑vitro maturation (IVM).  \n\nWhy did the researchers do this review?  \nThe authors wanted to compare IVM followed by IVF or ICSI with the usual IVF or ICSI approach in women with PCOS, looking at both benefits (like having a baby) and harms (such as miscarriage or OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared IVM with standard IVF in women with PCOS, combined the results, and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found four trials that together included 810 women with PCOS who were trying to become pregnant using assisted reproduction. Two of the trials had a high risk of bias, while the other two were judged to be low risk. The studies were carried out in different countries and used either a GnRH‑antagonist protocol or similar medication regimens.\n\nMain results  \n\n- Live birth: It is unclear if IVM has an effect on the chance of having a baby.  \n- Miscarriage per clinical pregnancy: IVM increases miscarriage slightly.  \n- Moderate or severe OHSS: IVM causes a large reduction in the risk of this condition.  \n- Preterm birth: IVM probably makes little to no difference to the chance of a baby being born early.  \n- Congenital anomalies: IVM may make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence about live birth because the studies were very small and some did not use methods that prevent bias. For miscarriage and OHSS the evidence is more reliable, but the overall picture is still limited by the small number of trials.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
