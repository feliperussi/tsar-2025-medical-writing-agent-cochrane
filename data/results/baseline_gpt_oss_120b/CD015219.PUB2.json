  "text": "Does favipiravir help people with COVID‑19, and is it safe?\n\nKey messages  \n- We do not know whether favipiravir (an antiviral medicine) improves survival or prevents the need for a breathing machine in people with COVID‑19, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- The medicine may cause more mild side‑effects, but it does not appear to increase serious side‑effects.  \n- Better, larger studies are needed to find out if favipiravir really works and is safe for different groups of people with COVID‑19.  \n\nWhat is COVID‑19 and why do we need treatments?  \nCOVID‑19 is an illness caused by the virus SARS‑CoV‑2. It can range from a mild cold‑like illness to severe breathing problems that need hospital care. Because the disease can become serious quickly, doctors look for medicines that can stop the virus from multiplying and reduce the chance of severe illness.  \n\nWhat is favipiravir and what did the review want to find out?  \nFavipiravir is an antiviral medicine that some experts thought might stop the coronavirus from growing. The review team wanted to see whether favipiravir, compared with no specific medicine, usual care, or other experimental antivirals, helps people with acute (sudden‑onset) COVID‑19 get better and stay safe.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many databases for studies that compared favipiravir with other treatments up to 18 July 2023. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 25 studies that together included about 5 750 adults, most of them under 60 years old. The studies were carried out in countries such as Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Most participants (about nine‑in‑ten) were in hospital with mild to moderate COVID‑19. In most trials favipiravir was given at a high dose on the first day and then a lower dose for five to 14 days.  \n\nThe evidence does not show that favipiravir reduces death within a month, and we are very uncertain about this result. We also cannot tell if the medicine lowers the chance of needing a breathing machine, and our confidence is very low. For people who were not yet in hospital, favipiravir probably makes little or no difference to whether they later need to be admitted. The medicine probably makes little or no difference to the need for extra oxygen.  \n\nRegarding side‑effects, favipiravir may lead to more mild adverse events (such as nausea or headache), but it probably does not increase serious adverse events.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small and may have had problems with how they were carried out, such as not keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment was given.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",
