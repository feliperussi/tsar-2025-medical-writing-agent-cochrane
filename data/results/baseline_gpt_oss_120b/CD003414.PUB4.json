  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nWhich cycle regimen is best for preparing the uterus before a frozen embryo transfer (FET)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- We are uncertain whether any one way of preparing the uterus – a natural cycle, hormone‑therapy (HT) cycle, or ovulation‑induction cycle – leads to more live births or fewer miscarriages. Some moderate‑certainty evidence suggests hormone‑therapy cycles probably make little or no difference compared with hormone‑therapy plus a GnRHa medicine, but the overall picture remains unclear. No clear information on side‑effects or other harms was reported.  \n- The studies we found were often small, did not always report important outcomes, and described their methods poorly, so the confidence in the results is low to very low.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies that clearly report both benefits and any unwanted effects are needed before we can say which cycle regimen works best for people undergoing FET.\n\nWhat is the health problem and why does it matter?  \nWhat is frozen embryo transfer (FET) and how is the uterus prepared?  \nFrozen embryo transfer (FET) is a way to try to achieve pregnancy by placing an embryo that was created earlier into the uterus. Before the embryo is placed, doctors need the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) to be ready. This can be done in three main ways: letting the body follow its own natural cycle, giving medicines that contain estrogen and progesterone (hormone‑therapy or HT), or using drugs that trigger ovulation (ovulation‑induction). Some HT cycles also add a medicine called a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to suppress the body’s own hormones.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to compare the different ways of preparing the uterus – natural cycles, HT cycles, HT with GnRHa, and ovulation‑induction cycles – to see which method leads to more live births, fewer miscarriages, and any other important outcomes.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared these cycle regimens up to 19 December 2022. We combined the findings from the studies and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 32 studies that together included more than 6 000 women who had a frozen embryo transfer. The studies were carried out in several countries and used a mix of natural cycles, hormone‑therapy cycles (with or without GnRHa), and ovulation‑induction cycles. Many of the studies were small and did not always describe how they were done or report all outcomes.\n\nOverall, the evidence does not show a clear advantage for any one regimen.  \n\n- When natural cycles were compared with standard hormone‑therapy cycles, the evidence was of low certainty and we are uncertain whether live‑birth rates, miscarriage rates, ongoing‑pregnancy rates, or the chance of having twins differ.  \n- When natural cycles were compared with hormone‑therapy cycles that also used GnRHa, the evidence was of moderate certainty and probably makes little or no difference to live‑birth rates or the chance of twins. The effect on miscarriage and ongoing‑pregnancy rates remains uncertain.  \n- When natural cycles were compared with a “modified” natural cycle that uses an HCG trigger, the evidence (low to moderate certainty) suggests probably little or no difference in ongoing‑pregnancy and miscarriage rates, while the effect on live‑birth and twin rates is uncertain.  \n- Comparisons between modified natural cycles (with HCG trigger) and hormone‑therapy cycles (with or without GnRHa) showed uncertain differences for all outcomes, with low‑certainty evidence for most comparisons.  \n- Direct comparisons of hormone‑therapy cycles with and without GnRHa also showed uncertain differences for live‑birth, miscarriage, ongoing‑pregnancy, and twin rates, with moderate‑certainty evidence suggesting probably little or no difference for live‑birth rates.\n\nIn short, the current research does not provide a clear answer about which preparation method works best, and the reported side‑effects or other harms are not well described.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, the way the studies were done was not always clear, and important outcomes such as side‑effects were often missing. These issues make it hard to be sure about any true differences between the cycle regimens.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
