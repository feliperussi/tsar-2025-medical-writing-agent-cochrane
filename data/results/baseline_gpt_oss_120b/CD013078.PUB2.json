  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs doing strengthening exercises better than no treatment, injections, or surgery for knee‑tendon pain in athletes?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Strengthening exercises (such as slow, controlled leg lifts) may reduce knee‑tendon pain compared with doing nothing, but the evidence is very uncertain and we cannot be sure of the size of any benefit; no studies reported side‑effects.  \n- Compared with steroid injections or surgery, strengthening exercises probably make little or no difference to pain, how well the knee works, or the chance of returning to sport, but the evidence is of low confidence.  \n- More well‑designed studies with larger groups of athletes are needed to find out whether exercise truly helps, whether it is safe, and how it compares with other treatments.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy?  \nPatellar tendinopathy is a common knee problem that causes pain at the front of the knee where the tendon attaches to the kneecap. It often affects people who jump or run a lot, such as athletes. The pain can make it hard to train, play sport, or even walk up stairs.\n\nWhy do people try exercises for this condition?  \nThe main way doctors try to treat this tendon pain is with specific exercises that aim to make the tendon stronger and more flexible. The most common type is “eccentric” exercise, where the muscle lengthens while it is working. Exercises can be done on land or in water, with or without weight‑bearing. Other options sometimes used are surgery or steroid (glucocorticoid) injections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to see whether strengthening exercises improve pain, knee function, overall treatment success, quality of life, or the chance of returning to sport, and whether they cause any unwanted effects. We also compared the exercises with no treatment, with steroid injections, and with surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared strengthening exercises with other approaches up to September 2023. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified a small number of studies that together included a few hundred athletes, most of whom were young adult men with long‑standing knee‑tendon pain. The studies were carried out in different countries and used various types of strengthening exercises. Some studies compared exercise with doing nothing, others compared it with steroid injections, surgery, stretching, or other physical therapies. No study compared exercise with a fake or sham treatment. None of the studies reported any side‑effects from the exercises.\n\nMain results  \n\n- **Exercise versus no treatment** – We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercises reduce pain compared with doing nothing. The evidence also suggests that exercise may make little or no difference to how well the knee works, but we have only low confidence in this finding.  \n\n- **Exercise versus steroid injection** – The available evidence, which is of low confidence, indicates that strengthening exercises probably make little or no difference to pain or knee function when compared with a steroid injection.  \n\n- **Exercise versus surgery** – The evidence is very uncertain about any benefit of exercise over surgery for pain, knee function, overall treatment success, or the chance of returning to sport. In other words, we do not know whether exercise is better, worse, or the same as surgery for these outcomes.  \n\n- **Safety** – No study measured or reported any adverse events from the exercises, so we cannot say whether they cause harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small, people and researchers knew which treatment was being given (so expectations could have influenced results), and the studies often did not report all the outcomes we were interested in. These issues make it hard to be sure about the true effects of exercise.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
