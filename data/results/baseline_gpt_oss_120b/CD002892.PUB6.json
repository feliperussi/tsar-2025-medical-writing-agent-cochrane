  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs doing individual stress‑reduction programmes helpful for healthcare workers who feel stressed?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Individual‑level programmes that teach people to notice or relax away from stress may lower stress symptoms in the short‑term and can keep stress lower for up to about a year, and no harmful effects were reported.  \n- Programs that try to change work‑related factors for each person have very uncertain effects because only a few small studies have looked at them.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm which types of programmes work best and to find out whether any long‑term benefits or harms exist.\n\nWhat is the problem?  \nHealthcare workers often face too many demands, not enough support, and high pressure at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and physical complaints, which can also affect the quality of care they provide.\n\nWhy look at individual‑level stress programmes?  \nInstead of changing the whole workplace, many programmes focus on the person. They may help people notice their stress, learn relaxation or exercise techniques, or change how they think about work. Understanding whether these personal approaches really reduce stress is important for workers and managers.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe aimed to see whether stress‑reduction programmes that target individual healthcare workers reduce stress symptoms compared with doing nothing, waiting, or using a different type of programme.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several databases for studies published up to February 2022 that compared individual stress programmes with no programme or another programme. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified 117 studies that together included 11,119 people who work in health‑care settings. Most studies were carried out in hospitals or clinics in many countries. About a third of the studies had at least 50 people in each group. The biggest concern across the studies was that participants usually knew which programme they were receiving, and many studies were small and did not report all details.\n\nMain results  \n\n- programmes that help people focus on their own stress experience may reduce stress symptoms slightly in the short‑term and may also reduce stress a bit after three to twelve months.  \n- programmes that help people shift their attention away from stress (for example, through relaxation or exercise) may reduce stress symptoms, with a moderate reduction in the short‑term and a small reduction after three to twelve months.  \n- programmes that combine two or more personal techniques may lower stress symptoms, showing a moderate reduction in the short‑term and a small reduction after three to twelve months.  \n- programmes that try to change work‑related factors for each person have very uncertain effects; the few small studies do not give a clear picture of any benefit.  \n- only a few studies compared one type of programme with another, and those results are also very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which programme they were getting, and because many of the studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
