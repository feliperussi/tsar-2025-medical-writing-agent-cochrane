  "text": "Does exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation help people with heart failure?\n\n- Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) probably reduces the chance of being admitted to hospital and may improve everyday quality of life for people with heart failure. The review found no clear difference in overall death rates, and the studies did not report any harmful side‑effects from the exercise programmes.  \n- The benefits were seen in programmes run in hospitals, at home, or even through digital tools, and they applied to people with reduced‑function heart failure as well as to some with preserved‑function heart failure.  \n- We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that participants knew which treatment they were receiving and because many of the studies were small. More research is needed that includes older adults, women, and people with preserved‑function heart failure.\n\n**What is heart failure and why does it matter?**  \nHeart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump blood as well as it should. This leads to tiredness, shortness of breath, and a lower ability to do everyday activities. People with heart failure often have a poorer quality of life, are more likely to be hospitalized, and face a higher risk of early death.  \n\n**What is exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation?**  \nExCR is a program that includes regular physical activity, sometimes combined with education, counseling, or other health support. The exercise can be done in a hospital centre, at home, or through online platforms. The goal is to improve the heart’s ability to work, boost stamina, and enhance overall well‑being.  \n\n**What did we want to find out?**  \nWe set out to discover whether ExCR changes the risk of death, the need for hospital care, and the quality of life for adults living with heart failure.\n\n**What did we do?**  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared an exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation program with usual care that did not include exercise. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall findings.\n\n**What did we find?**  \nWe identified 60 studies that together included 8,728 adults with heart failure. Most participants had reduced‑function heart failure and were in the middle stages of the disease. The programmes lasted at least six months and were delivered either in hospitals, at home, or through digital tools. The studies compared ExCR with usual care, and some also compared it with other active supports such as education or psychological counseling.  \n\nFor overall death rates, the evidence was of low certainty and showed that exercise did not make a clear difference. For hospital admissions, the evidence was of moderate certainty and suggested that exercise probably reduces the chance of being admitted to the hospital, both for any reason and specifically for heart‑failure‑related problems. For quality of life, the evidence of moderate certainty indicated that exercise probably improves how people feel day‑to‑day. When looking at a broader range of quality‑of‑life measures, the evidence was very uncertain, but it hinted that exercise may bring a small improvement. No harmful effects were reported in the studies.  \n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and because many of the studies were small.  \n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
