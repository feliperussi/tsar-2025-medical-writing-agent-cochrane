  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs using a nicotine patch together with a fast‑acting nicotine product (like gum or lozenge) more effective for quitting smoking than using just one form?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Using a fast‑acting nicotine product together with a nicotine patch probably helps more people stop smoking than using only a patch or only a fast‑acting product.  The safety of this combination appears similar to using a single product, with few serious heart problems reported.  \n- Higher‑dose nicotine patches (stronger strength) probably work better than lower‑dose patches, and starting nicotine replacement before the quit day (pre‑loading) probably improves quit rates compared with starting only on the quit day.  Using a fast‑acting product alone or a patch alone makes little or no difference in success rates.  \n- Many of the studies were small or had design issues, so we have only moderate confidence in some findings.  More research is needed on the best length of treatment, the safest forms of nicotine replacement, and on reporting side‑effects consistently.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and why do people use it?  \nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a set of medicines that give a small amount of nicotine without smoking.  It can come as a patch that sticks to the skin, gum, lozenge, spray, or inhaler.  NRT helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, making it easier for people who want to quit smoking to stay smoke‑free.\n\nWhy might different types, doses, or ways of using NRT matter?  \nThere are many ways to use NRT – different strengths of patches, different amounts of gum, using one product alone or several together, and starting the product before the day you plan to quit.  Researchers want to know whether any of these choices make quitting easier or cause more side‑effects.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see which forms, strengths, lengths of use, and timing of NRT work best for helping people stay quit for at least six months, and whether any of these options cause more heart problems or other side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched a large database of studies for any research that compared one way of using NRT with another way, looking at results at least six months after people tried to quit.  We combined the findings from the studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall picture.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified dozens of studies that together involved many thousands of adults who wanted to quit smoking.  The studies were carried out in many countries and mostly recruited people from community settings or health clinics.  The research compared many different NRT strategies, such as using a patch alone, using gum or lozenge alone, using a patch together with a fast‑acting product, using higher‑strength versus lower‑strength patches, and starting NRT before the quit day versus starting on the quit day.\n\n- **Combination of patch and fast‑acting product:**  High‑confidence evidence shows that using a patch together with a fast‑acting form (like gum, lozenge, or spray) probably helps more people stay quit than using just one form alone.  \n- **Patch strength:**  Moderate‑confidence evidence suggests that stronger patches (higher dose) probably work better than weaker patches, while using the very strongest patches may make little or no extra difference compared with the next lower strength.  \n- **Starting NRT before the quit day (pre‑loading):**  Moderate‑confidence evidence indicates that beginning NRT while still smoking, and then continuing after the quit day, probably improves quit rates compared with starting only on the quit day.  \n- **Fast‑acting product versus patch alone:**  High‑confidence evidence shows that using a fast‑acting product alone gives similar quit rates to using a patch alone, making little or no difference.  \n- **Length of treatment and type of fast‑acting product:**  Low‑confidence evidence means we cannot tell whether using NRT for a longer or shorter time, or choosing one fast‑acting form over another, changes quit rates.  \n\nSafety outcomes such as heart‑related side‑effects, serious adverse events, and people stopping treatment because of problems were reported only in a few studies and the evidence is of low confidence.  Overall, serious side‑effects were rare, and most comparisons showed no clear difference in safety.  One small study found more people stopped treatment when using a nasal spray compared with a patch, and another found more withdrawals with the highest‑dose patches, but the evidence for these findings is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in many of the findings because several studies were small, some did not hide which treatment people received, and the way side‑effects were reported varied a lot.  This means we cannot be sure about the exact size of the benefits or harms for many of the comparisons.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
