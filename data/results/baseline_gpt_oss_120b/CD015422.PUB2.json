The skin reactions that sometimes happen are mild and occur in very few people.  Because the studies were small and had some problems, we have little confidence that these benefits are real.\n- The evidence does not clearly show that repellents protect people who are already using bed nets or indoor spraying, and the overall benefit appears to be small.\n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed, particularly in refugee camps and other high‑risk settings, to find out whether repellents can reliably protect individuals from malaria.\n\n**What is malaria and why do we need more ways to stop it?**  \nMalaria is a disease spread by mosquito bites.  It can cause fever, chills, and, if not treated, can become life‑threatening.  Most control programmes use insect‑treated bed nets and indoor spraying, which work best against mosquitoes that bite and rest inside homes.  When people spend time outdoors or sleep outside, these tools do not protect them, leaving a gap in protection.\n\n**Why might topical repellents help?**  \nTopical repellents are creams, lotions, or sprays that keep mosquitoes away from the skin where they are applied.  They could be useful for people who cannot use bed nets or indoor spraying, such as refugees living in camps, soldiers in the field, or forest workers who are outdoors at night.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**  \nWe set out to see whether using topical repellents, alone or together with bed nets or indoor spraying, reduces the number of new malaria infections and the number of people who have malaria.\n\n**What did we do?**  \nWe looked for studies that compared people who used topical repellents with people who did not, or with people who used other mosquito‑control methods.  We gathered the results from those studies and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall picture.\n\n**What did we find?**  \nWe identified eight studies that examined topical repellents.  Six of these studies, involving thousands of people, provided data that could be combined.  The studies were carried out in several countries and included both high‑risk groups (such as refugees) and the general population.  Most participants were adults and children living in areas where malaria is common.  A few studies also used bed nets or indoor spraying alongside the repellents.\n\nThe combined results suggest that using topical repellents may slightly lower the chance of getting a malaria infection and may slightly reduce how many people have malaria at a given time.  The possible benefit appears larger in high‑risk groups that do not receive other mosquito‑control tools.  Side‑effects were rare; only a very small number of people reported mild skin irritation.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies knew whether they were using a repellent or not, and because the studies were relatively small.  These issues make it hard to be sure that the small benefits we saw are real.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**  \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
