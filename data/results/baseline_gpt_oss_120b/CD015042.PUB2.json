  "text": "Do brief counseling sessions help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n- Brief counseling (psychosocial) sessions may increase the chance that pregnant women stay completely alcohol‑free, but they probably do not change how many drinks a woman has on a typical day. No information was reported about any side‑effects or harms, and no studies tested medicines for this purpose.\n- No research was found that looked at medicines to help pregnant women stop drinking, so we do not know whether any drug would be safe or effective.\n- More well‑designed studies are needed, especially ones that test medicines, report any adverse effects, and include clear details about how much alcohol women drink before and during pregnancy.\n\nWhat is the problem with alcohol use in pregnancy?\nAlcohol can harm a developing baby, yet many pregnant people still drink. About one in ten pregnant people worldwide, and up to one in four in some European countries, report drinking alcohol. Because the baby’s brain is developing, any alcohol exposure can lead to lifelong problems.\n\nWhy look at counseling and medicines?\nHealth professionals try many ways to help pregnant people stop drinking, including short counseling talks and, in other situations, medicines that reduce cravings. We wanted to find out whether these approaches actually work for pregnant people.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to see whether brief counseling sessions or any medicines could help pregnant people either stop drinking completely or reduce how much they drink. We also wanted to know whether these approaches affect how many people stay in treatment and whether they cause any unwanted side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many databases for studies that compared counseling or medicines with usual care or no treatment. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight studies that together involved about 1,300 pregnant people. Six of the studies were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All of the studies tested brief counseling sessions that lasted from a single 10‑minute talk up to five short meetings. The counseling was usually given around the end of the first trimester, and alcohol use was checked again 2 to 6 months later. The comparison groups received the usual care that health services normally provide, such as general advice to stop drinking. No study examined any medicines for this purpose, and none reported on side‑effects or other harms.\n\nThe evidence suggests that brief counseling may increase the chance that a pregnant person remains completely alcohol‑free. The same counseling probably does not change how many drinks a person has on a typical day, and it likely makes little or no difference to how many people finish the treatment program.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings because the studies were small and because participants often knew which type of counseling they were receiving, which could influence the results. These factors make it hard to be sure about the true effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
