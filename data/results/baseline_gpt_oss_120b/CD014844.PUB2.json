  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDo routine antibiotics before uterine‑evacuation procedures lower infection risk for women experiencing early pregnancy loss?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Giving antibiotics before the procedure may lower the chance of a uterine infection, and it does not appear to increase vomiting or diarrhoea, but we are not sure whether it raises the risk of allergic reactions.  \n- When only the best‑quality studies are considered, antibiotics cause a large reduction in uterine infections, showing a clearer benefit.  \n- More well‑designed research is needed, especially to confirm side‑effect risks and to ensure that people actually take the medicines as planned.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and how is it treated?  \nEarly pregnancy loss (often called a miscarriage) means a pregnancy ends before it can develop fully. To complete the process doctors often perform a uterine‑evacuation, which gently removes any remaining tissue from the uterus. This procedure is usually quick and done in a clinic or hospital.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be given before the procedure?  \nIf a woman shows signs of infection, doctors already give antibiotics to treat it. The question is whether antibiotics should also be given to women who have no signs of infection, just to prevent any infection that might develop after the uterine‑evacuation.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether routine antibiotic prophylaxis (giving antibiotics before the procedure) reduces uterine infections and whether it causes any unwanted side‑effects such as vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that compared giving antibiotics before uterine‑evacuation with giving a placebo or no treatment. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found six studies that together included 4,371 women who had a uterine‑evacuation for early pregnancy loss. The studies were carried out in several countries and used different types of antibiotics. Most women were of reproductive age and had no signs of infection before the procedure. One study also reported side‑effects.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that routine antibiotics may make little or no difference to the chance of a uterine infection, but the certainty of this finding is low because many studies had poor follow‑up and many participants did not take the antibiotics as planned.  \n\nWhen we looked only at the three studies that were judged to have low risk of bias (the most reliable ones), antibiotics caused a large reduction in uterine infections. This result is supported by high confidence because the studies were well conducted and consistent.  \n\nSide‑effects reported in a single study showed that antibiotics likely make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea. The same study suggested a possible increase in allergic reactions, but the evidence for this is uncertain. No cases of severe allergic shock (anaphylaxis) were observed.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the overall evidence because the studies had poor follow‑up and many women did not follow the antibiotic regimen, making it hard to know the true effect.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
