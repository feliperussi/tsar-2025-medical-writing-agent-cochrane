  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) effective for relieving period pain in women?\n\nKey Messages  \n- High‑frequency TENS and low‑frequency TENS probably reduce menstrual‑cramp pain compared with a fake treatment or no treatment, and the studies did not report any side‑effects, so we do not know whether harms occur.  \n- We are not sure whether one type of TENS works better than the other, or whether TENS works as well as medicines such as paracetamol or NSAIDs, because the evidence is very limited and uncertain.  \n- More well‑designed studies are needed that look at how TENS affects daily activities, the need for extra pain medicines, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is period pain and why does it matter?  \nPeriod pain (primary dysmenorrhoea) is the painful cramping many women feel during their menstrual cycle. The pain can be strong enough to stop daily activities, school, or work. Most women use medicines such as paracetamol or NSAIDs, but some prefer non‑medicine options.\n\nWhat is TENS and how might it help?  \nTENS is a small device that sends gentle electrical currents through stickers (electrodes) placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents may block pain signals, trigger the body’s own pain‑relieving chemicals, and improve blood flow to the uterus.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether high‑frequency or low‑frequency TENS eases period pain better than a placebo, no treatment, or other common treatments, and whether it causes any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared TENS with other options for period pain. We combined the results of those studies and judged how much confidence we could have in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 20 studies that together included 585 women aged 12 to 49 years with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were carried out in several countries and compared high‑frequency TENS, low‑frequency TENS, placebo or no treatment, and other treatments such as acupressure, paracetamol, NSAIDs, or interferential current therapy. Most studies were small and were funded by a mix of academic and private sources.\n\n- High‑frequency TENS probably reduces pain compared with a fake treatment or no treatment.  \n- Low‑frequency TENS probably reduces pain compared with a fake treatment or no treatment.  \n- We do not know whether high‑frequency TENS works better or worse than low‑frequency TENS.  \n- We do not know whether high‑frequency TENS or low‑frequency TENS works as well as medicines such as paracetamol or NSAIDs, because the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- The studies gave little information about side‑effects, so we cannot say whether TENS causes any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small, some did not hide the treatment from participants, and the results varied between studies. These issues make it hard to be sure about the true effects of TENS.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",
