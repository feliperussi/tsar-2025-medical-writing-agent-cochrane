  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs sinus surgery helpful for people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- We are not sure whether adding endoscopic sinus surgery to regular medical care improves nose problems, reduces lung infections, lowers the need for antibiotics, or helps lung function in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. The only study we found reported one episode of bleeding during surgery that was fixed at the time and did not cause lasting harm.  \n- The evidence is very uncertain because it comes from a single small study that did not provide enough detail about many important outcomes.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies that follow people for at least a year are needed to find out if sinus surgery really helps this group.  \n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why do nose problems matter?  \nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that makes the body’s secretions thick and sticky. This can block the sinuses, leading to chronic sinus inflammation (chronic rhinosinusitis) and growth of nasal polyps, which are soft, non‑cancerous bumps inside the nose. These nose problems can make breathing through the nose hard and may affect how well medicines work for the lungs.  \n\nWhat is endoscopic sinus surgery and what other treatments exist?  \nEndoscopic sinus surgery is a procedure where a thin camera and small tools are used to open the sinus passages and remove nasal polyps. The goal is to clear the sinuses so that medicines, such as nasal rinses or inhaled antibiotics, can reach the area better. The usual non‑surgical approach is to treat the nose with medicines alone, such as saline rinses, steroids, or antibiotics.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether doing sinus surgery, either alone or together with medical treatment, changes nose symptoms, lung infections, the need for antibiotics, hospital stays, or overall lung function compared with medical treatment alone in people with CF and nasal polyps.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many databases for studies that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment alone. We combined the results of any studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 66 publications but only one study met our criteria. That study included 28 young adults (aged 19‑28) with CF and nasal polyps. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either nasal rinses alone or nasal rinses plus endoscopic sinus surgery that removed polyps and opened the sinuses. The study lasted a short period and was funded by the research team; no industry funding was reported.  \n\nBecause the evidence is very uncertain, we can only say:  \n- It is unclear if adding surgery to medical care changes how people feel about their nose symptoms.  \n- It is unclear if surgery reduces the amount of bacteria living in the nose.  \n- It is unclear if surgery lowers the need for antibiotics.  \n- It is unclear if surgery reduces the number of lung flare‑ups (pulmonary exacerbations).  \n- It is unclear if surgery improves lung function.  \n\nOne participant experienced bleeding during the operation, which was stopped during the procedure and caused no lasting problems. The study did not report on survival.  \n\nWhat did we learn about the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the only study was very small, involved few participants, and provided limited information about many outcomes. The study also could not hide which treatment each person received, which may affect how results were reported.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.
