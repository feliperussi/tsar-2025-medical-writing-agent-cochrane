  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nWhat treatment works best for a blocked dialysis fistula or graft (the tube that lets people with kidney failure clean their blood)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- We could not find clear evidence that any one method—such as surgery, a clot‑removing device, or a clot‑dissolving medicine—keeps a blocked dialysis access open better than the others, and reports of side‑effects were limited.  \n- Because the studies were few, small, and often had design problems, we are not confident in the results.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to show which approach is safest and most effective for people on haemodialysis.\n\nWhat is the problem with dialysis access?  \nPeople who need haemodialysis (a treatment that cleans the blood) use a special tube called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or an arteriovenous graft (AVG). When these tubes become blocked by a clot, the person often has to use a temporary catheter. Temporary catheters increase the risk of infections, blockages in larger veins, and repeated hospital stays. Keeping the permanent tube open is therefore very important for health and quality of life.\n\nWhat treatments are used to fix a blocked access?  \nDoctors can try several ways to clear a blocked tube:  \n– Surgery that repairs the spot where the tube joins the blood vessel (re‑anastomosis).  \n– Mechanical thrombectomy, a procedure that uses a device to pull the clot out.  \n– Thrombolysis, a medicine that dissolves the clot.  \nGuidelines suggest surgery may be best when the blockage is caused by a narrowing at the joining point, while other guidelines favor endovascular (inside‑the‑vessel) techniques for other situations.\n\nWhat did the review try to find out?  \nWe wanted to learn which of these treatments works best to keep the dialysis tube open, prevent it from failing again, and avoid harmful side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that compared the different treatments for blocked fistulas or grafts, combined the findings, and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified several studies that together involved hundreds of people receiving haemodialysis with a blocked AVF or AVG. The studies were carried out in many countries and were funded by a mix of public sources and industry. The research looked at three main types of treatment: mechanical clot‑removing devices, clot‑dissolving medicines, and surgical repair.  \n\nBecause the studies were small, often had design flaws, and many were influenced by industry funding, the overall picture remains very uncertain. It is unclear if any of the methods makes a noticeable difference in keeping the access open for about a month, in preventing the access from failing, or in reducing side‑effects. Reports of serious harms such as death or major complications were rare, and many important outcomes were not reported at all.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not always placed randomly into the different treatment groups, the studies were small, and many were funded by industry, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
