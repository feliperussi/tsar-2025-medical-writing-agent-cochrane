  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDo combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) reduce menstrual cramps and what side effects might they cause?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) reduce menstrual pain, but they also cause irregular bleeding and probably increase headaches and nausea; the review did not find clear evidence about weight change.  \n- Taking the pill continuously (without the usual break) may lower pain more than the standard schedule, but the safety of this approach is still uncertain.  \n- More research is needed on long‑term safety, on how the pills compare with pain‑relieving medicines such as NSAIDs, and on which pill types work best for different people.  \n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea?  \nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur without any pelvic disease. The pain can be severe enough to affect school, work or daily activities.  \n\nWhy do people use birth control pills for menstrual cramps?  \nBirth control pills contain a mix of estrogen and progestogen and are often prescribed to lessen menstrual pain. They are easy to take and can also prevent pregnancy, which makes them a popular option.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know how well birth control pills relieve menstrual pain and what unwanted effects they may cause. We also looked at whether different pill schedules or types change the benefits or harms, and how the pills compare with common pain medicines (NSAIDs).  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that compared birth control pills with placebo, other pill types, or NSAIDs. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified 21 studies that together included about 3,700 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were carried out in many countries and lasted from a few months to a year. Some studies compared the pill with a dummy pill (placebo), some compared different doses or schedules, one compared the pill with NSAIDs, and a few compared one pill type with another.  \n\nMain results  \n\nPain relief  \nHigh‑certainty evidence shows that birth control pills reduce menstrual pain compared with no treatment.  \n\nSide effects – any adverse event  \nModerate‑certainty evidence indicates that the pills probably increase the chance of experiencing some side effect.  \n\nIrregular bleeding  \nHigh‑certainty evidence shows that the pills cause a large increase in irregular bleeding.  \n\nHeadaches and nausea  \nModerate‑certainty evidence suggests the pills probably increase the likelihood of headaches and the likelihood of nausea.  \n\nWeight change  \nLow‑certainty evidence leaves us unsure whether the pills affect weight.  \n\nContinuous versus standard schedule  \nLow‑certainty evidence hints that using the pill continuously (without the usual break) may lower pain more than the standard schedule, but the safety of continuous use is not well established.  \n\nDifferent pill types  \nEvidence shows little or no difference in pain relief between newer‑generation pills and older‑generation pills, and between different estrogen doses.  \n\nPills versus NSAIDs  \nThere is not enough information to decide whether the pills work better than NSAIDs for pain relief, and the study did not report side effects for this comparison.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are confident about the pain‑relieving effect and the increase in irregular bleeding because many well‑conducted studies reported these outcomes. We have only moderate confidence about headaches, nausea and overall side‑effect risk because some studies were small or had design issues. For weight change, continuous use, and comparisons with NSAIDs, we have little confidence because the studies were few, small, or gave mixed results.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
