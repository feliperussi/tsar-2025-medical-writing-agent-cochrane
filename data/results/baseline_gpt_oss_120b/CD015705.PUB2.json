  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs using personal mobile phones at work helpful or harmful for health‑care workers?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Using their own mobile phones (handheld devices that can call, text, and access the internet) can make health‑care workers more flexible, quicker, and better able to keep in touch with patients and colleagues, but it can also cost workers money, create privacy problems for patients, and increase pressure on staff. We are moderately confident about these findings.  \n- The good and bad effects are felt most strongly by workers in low‑resource settings, where phones are often unpaid and internet or electricity is unreliable.  \n- Future research should explore ways to keep the benefits of personal phone use while reducing costs, privacy risks, and unequal impacts on different staff groups.\n\nWhat is the review about?  \nWhy do health‑care workers sometimes use their own phones at work?  \nHealth‑care workers often have to deliver care in places where official communication systems do not work well. To fill the gap, many workers pick up their personal mobile phones, use their own data plans, and call or message colleagues outside of work hours. This “informal” use is not officially approved by their employers, but it can help them provide care when formal tools are missing.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to learn what health‑care workers, managers, and other staff think and feel about using personal phones and other mobile devices for work, how they actually use them, and what advantages or problems arise from this practice.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched four large research databases for studies published since 2008 that explored health‑care workers’ informal use of mobile phones. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how much confidence we could have in each conclusion.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found 30 studies that together included many health‑care workers from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries. The studies were carried out in a variety of health‑care settings such as clinics, hospitals, and community health posts. Most of the research described the use of personal mobile phones rather than tablets or other devices.\n\nMain results  \nHealth‑care workers use their own phones to fill gaps when official systems are missing. This often helps them be more flexible, faster, and more responsive to patients’ needs, and it can make the relationship between workers and community members stronger. **We are moderately confident that informal phone use probably improves flexibility and communication for health‑care workers.**  \n\nAt the same time, using personal phones can create new problems. Workers have to pay for calls, data, and airtime, which can be a heavy cost, especially for lower‑paid staff and those in low‑income settings. Out‑of‑hours calls can intrude on personal time and cause stress. When workers store or share patient information on their own phones, patient privacy may be broken. Some workers may help certain patients more than others based on personal judgments, which can lead to unequal care. **We are moderately confident that informal phone use may increase costs for workers and raise privacy and equity concerns.**  \n\nOverall, the informal use of personal phones can both strengthen and weaken health‑care systems. It helps fill gaps but can also create “shadow” information channels that are not recorded in official records and may distract workers.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in these findings because many of the studies were small and sometimes did not describe all details we wanted. This means we cannot be completely sure how the results apply to every setting or to all types of health‑care workers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
