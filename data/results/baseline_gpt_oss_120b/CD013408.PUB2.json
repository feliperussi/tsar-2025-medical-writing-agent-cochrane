  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs organised, team‑based care (including virtual support) better than usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation (AF)?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Organised care that brings together doctors, nurses and virtual tools probably leads to a large drop in the chance of dying from any cause for people with AF, but it probably makes little or no difference to how often they need to be admitted to hospital for any reason.  \n- The same organised care probably reduces the chance of being hospitalized for heart‑related problems, while it may or may not lower deaths caused by heart disease and probably does not change the risk of stroke or serious bleeding.  \n- Because the studies were small, not blinded and varied in design, we need more well‑designed research—especially studies that compare different team‑based and digital models—to know for sure how these approaches affect health outcomes and costs.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?  \nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart rhythm problem that becomes more common as people get older. It can cause tiredness, shortness of the breath, and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and early death. Managing AF often requires medicines, lifestyle changes and regular check‑ups, which can be hard to coordinate.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to see whether organising health services in a collaborative, multidisciplinary way—including the use of phone or app‑based (mHealth) support—changes important outcomes for adults with any type of AF compared with the usual way care is delivered.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared organised, team‑based or virtual AF care with usual care, combined the findings, and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found eight studies that together included more than eight thousand adults with AF. Participants were on average between 60 and 73 years old. The research was carried out in China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four studies used a nurse‑led multidisciplinary approach, and two used mobile‑health (app or phone) programmes. The remaining studies compared these organised models with the usual care that patients receive. All studies had at least one area of uncertainty, especially because participants and staff often knew which type of care was being given.\n\nMain results  \n\n- Organised, team‑based care probably causes a large reduction in the chance of dying from any cause.  \n- The same organised care probably makes little or no difference to the chance of being hospitalized for any reason.  \n- It probably reduces the chance of being hospitalized for heart‑related problems.  \n- It may reduce deaths caused specifically by heart disease, but we are not sure.  \n- It may make little or no difference to the risk of stroke, and probably makes little or no difference to serious bleeding in the brain, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the finding that organised care lowers overall death because the studies were fairly consistent, but we have little confidence in many other results because the studies were small, participants and clinicians often knew which care they received, and some outcomes were not measured in the same way across studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
