  "text": "Is giving the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds helpful for getting pre‑term babies to start feeding on their own?  \n\n**Key messages**  \n- Giving the smell and taste of breast‑milk or formula while babies receive tube feeds makes little or no difference to how quickly they learn to suck and swallow on their own, and no extra safety problems were reported.  \n- The same lack of clear benefit was seen for how long babies need nutrition through a vein, how fast they reach full tube feeding, and the chance of serious gut problems or later infections.  \n- Because the studies were small and had several design problems, we are not confident that these results tell the whole story. More well‑designed research is needed to know if this simple, low‑cost idea can really help pre‑term infants.  \n\n### What is the problem that this review looks at?  \nPre‑term babies (born before 37 weeks) often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing.  Because of this, they get nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach or nose.  While the milk goes straight to the stomach, the baby does not get to smell or taste it.  Smell and taste normally help the body get ready for digestion, so researchers wondered whether letting babies experience the smell or taste of milk at the same time as the tube feed might help them start feeding on their own sooner.  \n\n### What did the reviewers want to find out?  \nThe reviewers set out to compare two groups of pre‑term babies: one group that received the smell or taste of milk (or both) together with their tube feeds, and another group that received tube feeds without any milk smell or taste.  They wanted to know whether the first group reached full sucking feeds faster and whether any harms occurred.  \n\n### What did we do?  \nWe looked for all studies that compared these two approaches, combined the results, and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall findings.  \n\n### What did we find?  \nWe found eight studies that together included about 1,300 pre‑term babies from several countries.  The studies varied in how they gave the smell or taste, how often they did it, and which babies were included.  Most studies were small and some did not clearly explain how babies were assigned to groups or whether the people caring for them knew which babies got the smell or taste.  \n\nWhen we put the results together, the evidence showed that exposing babies to the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeds **does not meaningfully speed up** the time it takes for them to start feeding on their own.  The same pattern was seen for how long babies needed nutrition through a vein, how quickly they reached full tube feeding, and the risk of serious gut inflammation (necrotising enterocolitis) or later infections.  No extra safety problems were reported in the few studies that looked at harms.  \n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, some did not use a clear method of assigning babies to groups, and many did not keep the caregivers blind to which babies received the smell or taste.  In addition, the studies used different ways of giving the smell or taste, which makes it hard to know what might work best.  \n\n### How up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.  \n\n---  \n\n**What should happen next?**  \nFuture research should involve larger groups of babies, use clear random assignment, and keep caregivers unaware of which babies receive the smell or taste.  Studies should also test different ways, frequencies, and lengths of exposure, and should look at important outcomes such as how well babies tolerate feeds, grow, and avoid infections while they are in the hospital.",
