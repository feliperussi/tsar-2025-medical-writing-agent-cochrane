  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDo changes to shift‑work schedules improve sleep quality, sleep length, or reduce sleepiness for people who work shifts?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Changing the way shifts are arranged may help people feel less sleepy while they are on the job, but the evidence is very uncertain and we did not find clear evidence that it improves how well people sleep when they are off work or how long they sleep. No harmful effects were reported.  \n- Some specific changes, such as limiting daily work to no more than 16 hours, probably give people a little more sleep and may make them a bit less sleepy, but the confidence in these findings is only moderate because the studies were small and not always well designed.  \n- More well‑conducted research is needed to know which shift‑schedule changes really help sleep and alertness, and to understand any possible downsides.  \n\nWhat is shift work and why does sleep matter?  \nShift work means working at times that are outside the usual daytime schedule, such as night shifts or rotating schedules. People who do shift work often get less sleep, feel more sleepy while working, and this can affect safety and health.  \n\nWhy might changing shift schedules help?  \nIf the pattern of work hours is altered – for example, by rotating shifts in a forward direction, making rotations faster, limiting how long each shift lasts, or giving longer breaks between shifts – it could give the body a better chance to rest and stay alert.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to discover whether any changes to shift schedules improve sleep quality (how good the sleep feels), sleep length (how many hours of sleep people get when they are off work), or reduce sleepiness while on shift.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared different ways of arranging shift work. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified 11 studies that together involved more than 2 000 shift workers from several countries. The studies looked at many different schedule changes, such as the direction of rotation (forward versus backward), how quickly rotations occurred, the maximum length of a daily shift, and whether shifts were compressed or spread out. Some studies used random assignment of workers to different schedules, while others observed existing schedules.  \n\nMain results  \n\n- Forward‑direction rotation compared with backward rotation probably does not change how good sleep feels or how long people sleep, but it may reduce sleepiness while on shift (very uncertain evidence).  \n- Faster rotation of shifts compared with slower rotation probably makes little or no difference to sleep quality, may slightly reduce the amount of sleep people get, and may reduce sleepiness (very uncertain evidence for the sleepiness effect).  \n- Limiting daily shift length to a maximum of 16 hours probably increases sleep length a little and probably reduces sleepiness while working (moderate confidence for reduced sleepiness, low confidence for more sleep).  \n- Shorter shifts (about eight to ten hours) compared with slightly longer shifts probably make little or no difference to sleep quality or sleep length, and the evidence about sleepiness is very uncertain.  \n- More compressed workweeks compared with more spread‑out schedules probably make little or no difference to sleep quality or sleep length, and the evidence about sleepiness is very uncertain.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in many of the findings because the studies often did not randomly assign workers to different schedules, the groups could differ for reasons other than the schedule, and the studies were generally small and varied in how they measured sleep.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
