  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nDo sealants (special glues) help stop bleeding faster after vascular surgery?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Sealants may cause a large reduction in the time needed to stop bleeding and may lower the chance that bleeding control fails, but we are not sure because the evidence is very uncertain; no clear differences were seen for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time of the operation, bleeding after surgery, or the need for another operation, and no harms were reported.  \n- The studies we found had many problems, such as not randomly assigning people to groups, being very small, and showing different results, so we have little confidence in the overall findings.  \n- Better, larger studies that carefully compare sealants with other methods are needed to know for sure how well sealants work and whether they cause any side effects.\n\nWhat is vascular surgery and why does bleeding matter?  \nVascular surgery is an operation that repairs or connects arteries, veins, or artificial tubes. When surgeons join these blood vessels, tiny holes from the needles can keep bleeding. Stopping this bleeding (called hemostasis) is important because too much blood loss can make the operation riskier and slow recovery.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used?  \nSealants are glue‑like substances that surgeons can apply directly to the bleeding spot. They are meant to be used when usual methods—such as pressing on the area or giving medicines that reverse blood thinners—do not stop the bleeding well enough.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether using sealants helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control compared with standard methods, and whether sealants cause any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched medical databases for studies that compared sealants with usual care in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe found 24 studies that together included 2 376 people who had vascular surgery. All studies compared a sealant (either a fibrin‑based glue or a synthetic glue) with standard care such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual pressure. The studies were carried out in many countries and involved adults of various ages. All of the studies had important problems that lowered our confidence in the results.\n\nMain results  \n- Sealants may cause a large reduction in the time needed to stop bleeding.  \n- Sealants may reduce the chance that the bleeding‑control method fails, but we do not know for sure.  \n- Sealants may make little or no difference to the amount of blood lost during the operation.  \n- Sealants may reduce the total time of the operation, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n- Sealants may slightly reduce bleeding that occurs after surgery, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n- Sealants may cause a large reduction in the chance of needing another operation because of bleeding, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n- No studies reported deaths from bleeding or measured quality of life, and no side‑effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, which means differences could be due to who the people were rather than the sealant itself. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they received, and the studies were very small, so the results may not be reliable. In addition, the studies used different types of sealants and methods, and only a few studies were available, making it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
