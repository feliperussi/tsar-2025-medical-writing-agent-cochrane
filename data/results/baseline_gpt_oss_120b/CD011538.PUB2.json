  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs school‑based education support helpful for children and teens who have a long‑lasting health condition?\n\nKey Messages  \n- The few studies we found do not give a clear answer about whether education support helps kids attend school more often or get better grades; the evidence is very uncertain and no information on possible harms was reported.  \n- Some small studies suggest that education support might lift children’s confidence or self‑esteem a little, but we have little confidence in this finding because the research was limited.  \n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to find out if education support really helps school attendance, learning, and overall well‑being for young people with chronic health conditions.\n\nWhat is the problem?  \nWhy does school attendance matter for children with long‑lasting health problems?  \nMany children and teenagers live with chronic health conditions—illnesses that last a long time and are not cured completely. These conditions can make it hard for them to go to school regularly. Missing school can lead to lower grades, weaker social skills, and fewer future job options.  \n\nWhat are education support services?  \nEducation support services are programs that try to keep children connected to school when their illness forces them to stay home. They may include tutoring, flexible class schedules, help with homework, or coordination between health providers and schools. The goal is to prevent the child from falling behind academically or socially.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe wanted to learn what kinds of education support are being used for children with chronic health conditions and whether these programs improve school attendance, learning outcomes, or other aspects such as confidence and mental health.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched eight major databases and several sources of unpublished work for studies that compared education support with usual care for children aged 4‑18 who have a chronic health condition. We gathered the results of the eligible studies and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified four small studies that together included 359 children. Three of the studies looked at kids with cancer and one studied children with attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The studies were carried out in different countries and were all funded by a mix of public and private sources. Each study tested a specific type of education support, such as extra tutoring or coordinated school‑health plans, and compared it with the usual school experience.\n\nSchool attendance and learning  \nBecause the studies were few and varied, we could not combine their numbers. Most of the studies hinted that education support might help children stay more engaged with school, but the evidence is very uncertain. In other words, it is unclear if education support makes a real difference to how often children attend school or how well they perform academically. No reports of negative effects or side‑effects were found.\n\nTransition back to school  \nOnly one small study looked at how education support helped children return to school after a period of illness. That study suggested a possible small benefit, but the result was uncertain and based on very few participants.\n\nMental health (self‑esteem)  \nTwo studies measured children’s confidence or self‑esteem. Both showed a slight improvement when education support was provided. However, because the studies were small and had methodological problems, we have little confidence that this benefit is real.\n\nOverall, the research was judged to be at high risk of bias because the studies did not always keep participants or teachers unaware of the group assignments, and many had other methodological weaknesses.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, had high risk of bias, and gave mixed results. This makes it hard to know whether education support truly helps school attendance, learning, or confidence for children with chronic health conditions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",
