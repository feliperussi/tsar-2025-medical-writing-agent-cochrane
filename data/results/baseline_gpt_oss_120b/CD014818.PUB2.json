  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs one type of regional pain‑block better than another for easing pain after breast‑cancer surgery?\n\nKey Messages  \n- All four regional blocks (paravertebral, erector‑spine, pectoral‑nerve and serratus‑anterior) probably make little or no difference to how much pain women feel after breast‑cancer surgery, and the few studies that looked at side‑effects did not find any serious problems.  \n- Because many of the studies were small and sometimes gave inconsistent results, we have only moderate to low confidence in these findings; more reliable research is needed to know whether any block truly eases pain better than the others.  \n- Future studies should include larger numbers of women, compare the blocks directly, and report any short‑ or long‑term harms so that we can be sure which technique, if any, offers a real advantage.\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?  \nBreast‑cancer surgery often leaves women with painful shoulders, chest and arm areas.  Good pain control helps people move, breathe and recover faster.  Doctors can give medicines that work throughout the whole body, but they also use “regional blocks” – injections that numb a specific area of the chest.  Four common blocks are:  \n\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spine.  \n- Erector‑spine plane block (ESPB) – an injection behind the muscles that run alongside the spine.  \n- Pectoral‑nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the chest muscles that move the arm.  \n- Serratus‑anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection under the muscle that covers the side of the rib cage.  \n\nThese blocks can reduce the need for strong pain medicines, but they also carry risks such as accidental injury to nerves or blood vessels.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to know whether any of these four blocks provides better pain relief after breast‑cancer surgery, and whether any of them causes more complications.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared two or more of the four blocks in women having breast‑cancer surgery.  We combined the results of the eligible studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nThe review included 39 studies that together involved about 2,300 women from several countries.  Most studies looked at a single injection of a long‑acting anesthetic guided by ultrasound.  The majority of the surgeries were modified radical mastectomies performed under general anesthesia in hospitals.  Only 16 of the studies provided data that could be used to compare pain levels directly.\n\nAcross the studies, the evidence showed:  \n\n- The pectoral‑nerve block (PEC) may reduce pain a little more than the paravertebral block (PVB) when people are at rest, but the difference is so small that it is unlikely to matter to patients.  (High‑certainty evidence → probably makes little or no difference.)  \n- The erector‑spine plane block (ESPB) and the serratus‑anterior plane block (SAPB) work about the same as PVB for pain at rest and during movement, with the same level of certainty ranging from high to moderate.  (High‑certainty or moderate‑certainty evidence → probably makes little or no difference.)  \n- For pain while moving two hours after surgery, PEC might lower pain a bit more than PVB, but the studies were few and gave mixed results, so we can only say it may reduce pain.  (Low‑certainty evidence → may reduce pain.)  \n- For pain at later times (24‑48 hours) the blocks all appeared similarly effective, and the evidence was either moderate or very uncertain.  (Moderate‑certainty or very‑low‑certainty evidence → may make little or no difference.)  \n- Only three small studies reported any complications, and none found serious problems such as nerve injury, bleeding, infection or lung collapse.  Because the number of participants was low, we cannot be sure that rare harms do not exist.  \n\nOverall, the four regional blocks seem comparable in how well they ease pain after breast‑cancer surgery, and serious side‑effects were not reported in the limited data available.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were small, some did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and the results sometimes varied between studies.  This means we cannot be sure that any one block truly works better or is safer than the others.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
