  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs self‑management training helpful for improving quality of life in adults with vision loss?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Self‑management training (programs that teach people how to cope with vision loss and keep doing daily activities) probably makes little or no difference to overall quality of life or vision‑related quality of life, and it probably does not change the chance of experiencing side‑effects. The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and varied.  \n- The research that exists mostly involved older adults with age‑related eye disease and did not include people who also have hearing loss. More work is needed to see if different types of training or different groups of people might benefit.  \n- Future studies should use more sensitive ways to measure quality of life, include a wider range of vision problems, and involve larger numbers of participants.\n\nWhat is the problem that people with vision loss face?  \nVision loss is common in older adults and can make everyday tasks harder, leading to feelings of frustration, loss of independence, and lower overall well‑being. Many people try to manage these challenges on their own, but it is unclear whether formal self‑management programs actually help.\n\nWhat are self‑management programs?  \nSelf‑management programs are structured activities that teach people skills such as using assistive devices, planning daily routines, setting personal goals, and coping with emotional impacts of vision loss. The idea is to give people tools to maintain independence and improve their sense of well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether self‑management programs improve health‑related quality of life or vision‑related quality of life compared with usual care, waiting‑list control, or other standard services, and whether these programs cause any unwanted side‑effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared self‑management programs with other care for adults with acquired vision loss. We combined the results of the eligible studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall findings.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified many studies that together involved several hundred adults with vision loss, most of whom were older and had age‑related eye disease. The studies were carried out in hospitals, low‑vision clinics, and rehabilitation centers across several continents. The self‑management programs varied but usually included several components such as training, goal‑setting, and use of assistive tools. Control groups either waited for treatment or received usual care, optical aids, or standard low‑vision rehabilitation.\n\nThe combined evidence showed that self‑management programs probably make little or no difference to overall quality of life, to vision‑specific quality of life, and to the risk of side‑effects. In other words, people who took part in these programs did not experience a clear improvement in how they felt about their health or vision, and they did not have more or fewer adverse events than those who received usual care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and showed differences in how the programs were delivered and measured. This makes it hard to be sure about the true effect of self‑management training.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",
