  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs psychedelic‑assisted therapy (using magic mushrooms or LSD) helpful for anxiety and depression in people with life‑threatening illnesses?  \n\nKey Messages  \n- Psychedelic‑assisted therapy with classic psychedelics (magic mushrooms or LSD) may lower anxiety and depression in people facing serious illnesses, but the evidence is not strong and could change with new research; serious side‑effects were not reported, though mild effects such as nausea, temporary anxiety, or blood‑pressure changes can occur.  \n- The same therapy might also ease feelings of hopelessness (existential distress), but the current evidence is very uncertain, and we do not know whether it improves overall quality of life.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm any benefits and to understand possible harms, especially because most existing research involved only a small number of participants.  \n\nWhat is the health problem and why does it matter?  \nPeople with life‑threatening diseases such as cancer often feel intense anxiety, deep sadness, and a sense that life has lost meaning. These emotional problems can reduce quality of life and make coping with the illness harder. Traditional medicines like antidepressants are sometimes used, but they do not always help and can have side‑effects.  \n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy?  \nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy is a treatment where a person takes a psychedelic substance (for example, magic mushrooms – which contain psilocybin, or LSD) under the careful guidance of trained clinicians. The session includes preparation before the drug, the drug experience itself, and follow‑up talks to help the person make sense of what they felt.  \n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy reduces anxiety, depression, or existential distress compared with a placebo or other active medicines, and whether it causes any harmful side‑effects.  \n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases and trial registers for all relevant studies up to 30 March 2024, without language or date limits. We combined the findings from the studies we found and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified six studies that together included about 150 people with serious illnesses, aged between their mid‑30s and mid‑60s. The studies were carried out in outpatient clinics in the United States and Switzerland and lasted from six to twelve months. None of the studies were funded by drug companies; instead, they were supported by organisations that promote psychedelic research.  \n\nThe studies examined two types of psychedelic‑assisted therapy: classic psychedelics (magic mushrooms or LSD) and MD + MA (the drug known as Ecstasy).  \n\n- **Anxiety:** Classic psychedelics may reduce anxiety, but the evidence is of low certainty, meaning we are not very sure about the result. For MD + MA, the evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot tell whether it helps or not.  \n- **Depression:** Classic psychedelics may also lower depression scores, again with low certainty. The effect of MD + MA on depression is very uncertain.  \n- **Existential distress (feelings of hopelessness):** Classic psychedelics might lessen hopelessness, but the evidence is very uncertain, and no data were available for MD + MA.  \n- **Quality of life and spirituality:** Some studies hinted at better quality of life and a sense of spiritual significance after classic psychedelic therapy, but the evidence is very uncertain. MD + MA showed no clear benefit for quality of life, and spirituality was not measured.  \n- **Safety:** No serious treatment‑related adverse events were reported in any study. Mild to moderate side‑effects occurred, such as temporary high blood pressure, nausea, brief anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, or headaches. These symptoms usually resolved when the drug’s effects wore off, often within a week.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, and it was difficult to keep participants and researchers unaware of which treatment was given (blinding). These issues make it hard to know whether the observed benefits are real or due to expectations.  \n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.  \n\n---  \n\nThis plain‑language summary aims to help you understand what is currently known about psychedelic‑assisted therapy for emotional problems in serious illness, what we still do not know, and why more research is needed.",
