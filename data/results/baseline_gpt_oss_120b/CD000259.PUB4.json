  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs audit and feedback (A&F) an effective way to improve how health professionals work?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Audit and feedback can lead to a modest increase in the amount of care that meets recommended standards; the review did not find reports of serious harms from using this approach.  \n- The improvement is probably larger when the feedback shows each professional’s own data, compares it with top‑performing peers, includes a local champion who knows the professional, uses both spoken and written formats, and provides a clear action plan.  \n- Because many of the studies had some risk of bias and were small, we are only moderately confident in these findings; more research is needed to confirm the best way to design audit and feedback.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback and why does it matter?  \nWhat is audit and feedback?  \nAudit and feedback (A&F) means first measuring how health professionals perform a specific task over a set period (the audit) and then giving them the results of that measurement (the feedback). The idea is that seeing where they fall short of a target will encourage them to change their practice.\n\nWhy try to improve professional practice?  \nHealth professionals make many decisions every day, such as which medicines to prescribe or which tests to order. When these decisions do not follow the best evidence, patients may receive less effective or unnecessary care. Finding ways to help professionals align their actions with recommended guidelines can improve patient outcomes and reduce waste.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether audit and feedback helps health professionals change their practice for the better, and which features of audit and feedback make it work best.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched for studies that compared audit and feedback with usual practice or no feedback. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nStudy characteristics  \nWe identified 292 studies that together examined 678 groups of health professionals. Most of the studies (about 81 %) involved doctors, and the most common behaviours targeted were prescribing medicines and ordering tests. Many studies also included extra components such as education sessions (used in about 56 % of groups) or reminder systems (about 15 %). The studies were carried out in many countries, but only a small number (9 %) were from low‑ or middle‑income settings. About half of the studies were judged to have a low risk of bias, while the rest had some concerns.\n\nMain results  \nAudit and feedback probably increases the amount of desired practice. In other words, when health professionals receive feedback about their own performance, they tend to do the recommended actions a little more often than they did before. The improvement is modest, roughly a few percent higher than without feedback.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that the effect is probably larger when the feedback is:  \n- given as individual‑level data rather than team‑level data,  \n- compared with top‑performing peers or a clear benchmark,  \n- delivered by a local champion who knows the professional,  \n- presented in interactive formats (both spoken and written), and  \n- accompanied by facilitation and a specific action plan for improvement.  \n\nThese design features appear to make audit and feedback work better, although the exact size of the benefit remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many of the studies had some risk of bias – for example, participants sometimes knew which feedback they were receiving – and because several studies were small, giving us limited precision about the true effect.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2020.",
