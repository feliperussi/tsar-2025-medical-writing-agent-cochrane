  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporary blocking of blood flow to a distant body part) helpful for people having major vascular or endovascular surgery?\n\nKey Messages  \n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, to heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, how long people stay in hospital, or to the length of the operation. It may also make little or no difference to the risk of losing a limb. No clear evidence of extra harms from RIPC was found.  \n- We are moderately confident in these findings because the studies were relatively small, showed some differences in how they were done, and not all possible studies may have been captured.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to see whether RIPC could have any real benefit for patients undergoing these surgeries.\n\nWhat is the problem that the review looks at?  \nWhy do we need better ways to protect people having major vascular surgery?  \nMajor vascular and endovascular operations are done to fix big blood‑vessel problems, but even with modern care they still carry a noticeable risk of serious complications such as death, heart attacks, kidney injury, stroke, or loss of a limb. Finding simple, low‑cost ways to protect the body’s tissues during these procedures could improve outcomes.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning?  \nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where a short, harmless blockage of blood flow is applied to a part of the body that is far away from the surgical site (for example, using a blood pressure cuff on an arm). The brief blockage is thought to “prime” the body’s protective mechanisms so that the organs are better able to tolerate the longer loss of blood flow that can happen during surgery.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?  \nThe review team wanted to know whether using RIPC before major vascular or endovascular surgery changes the chances of dying around the time of the operation, or affects important complications such as heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, limb loss, length of hospital stay, or how long the surgery takes, compared with not using RIPC.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared RIPC with no RIPC in people having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how much confidence we could have in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified several studies that together included many older adults, most of whom were men, who underwent major vascular or endovascular procedures in hospitals around the world. The studies used slightly different ways of delivering the brief blood‑flow block, but all compared it with the usual care where no block was applied.\n\nThe overall picture from these studies is that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, to the risk of having a heart attack, to developing kidney problems, to having a stroke, to how long people stay in hospital, and to how long the operation or anesthesia lasts. For the specific outcome of losing a limb, the evidence suggests RIPC may also make little or no difference, but the confidence in this finding is lower.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were relatively small, they used different methods and patient groups, and it is possible that not all relevant studies were identified. These factors make it harder to be certain about the exact effect of RIPC.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
