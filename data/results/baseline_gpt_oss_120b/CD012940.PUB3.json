No harmful effects were reported in the study we found.  \n- The evidence comes from only one small study, so we have little confidence in these results.  \n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to know for sure whether re‑feeding is helpful or not.\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?\nPreterm babies often receive milk through a tube because they are too small to feed by mouth. Nurses regularly check the amount of milk that comes back up from the stomach, called a gastric residual. Some units give this milk back to the baby (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). The idea behind re‑feeding is that the returned milk might contain partially digested food, enzymes, hormones and other substances that could help the baby’s gut develop. However, if the residual is abnormal it might increase the risk of vomiting, a serious gut infection called necrotising enterocolitis, or sepsis.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?\nThe reviewers wanted to know whether re‑feeding gastric residuals, compared with discarding them, improves growth and safety outcomes for preterm infants.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm babies. We combined the results of any eligible studies and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one study that included 72 preterm infants. The study was not blinded, meaning the caregivers knew which babies received re‑fed residuals and which did not, but otherwise it was conducted with good methods. The babies were cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit, and the study looked at outcomes such as weight gain, serious gut complications, death before discharge, time to reach full feeds, days on IV nutrition, and growth restriction at discharge.\n\nThe study showed that re‑feeding the gastric residuals may make little or no difference to these outcomes. In other words, giving the returned milk back to the baby did not clearly speed up weight gain, reduce the risk of serious gut problems, lower the chance of death, shorten the time needed to reach full feeds, reduce the number of days on IV nutrition, or improve growth at the time of leaving the hospital. The researchers were also uncertain about whether re‑feeding changes how often feeding is interrupted for long periods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was small and the staff knew which babies were receiving re‑fed residuals, which could affect the results. These factors make it hard to be sure that the findings reflect the true effect of re‑feeding.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
