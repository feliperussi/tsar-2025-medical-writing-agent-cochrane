  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title  \nIs wearing masks, using N95 respirators, or washing hands effective at stopping the spread of breathing viruses?\n\nKey Messages  \n- \"Masks that cover the nose and mouth probably make little or no difference to whether people get flu‑like illness, and serious side‑effects were rarely reported. N95 respirators may reduce flu‑like illness a little, but the evidence is uncertain, and discomfort from wearing them was sometimes mentioned. Hand washing probably lowers the overall chance of getting a respiratory infection, while its effect on flu‑like illness or confirmed flu is unclear.\"  \n- \"The studies we looked at often had problems such as people knowing which protection they were using, low follow‑up, and many participants not following the rules, so we cannot be very sure about the results.\"  \n- \"More large, well‑designed studies are needed that track how well people stick to the measures and that record any unwanted effects, especially for older people and young children.\"\n\nWhat is the problem that this review looks at?  \nWhy do we need ways to stop the spread of breathing viruses?  \nAcute respiratory infections such as the flu, SARS, and COVID‑19 spread quickly and can cause serious illness. Medicines and vaccines do not always stop the spread, so physical steps like masks, respirators, and hand washing are used to try to protect people.  \n\nWhat kinds of physical steps can help?  \nThe review examined many physical steps: wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95 or P2 respirators, washing hands, using gloves or gowns, face shields, screening people at entry points, isolating or quarantining people, and keeping physical distance.  \n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?  \nThe authors wanted to know whether these physical steps actually reduce the spread of breathing viruses and whether they cause any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared physical steps with doing nothing or with another step. We combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe identified 78 studies that together included about 610,000 people. The studies were done in many places, from schools in suburban areas to hospital wards in rich countries and crowded neighborhoods in poorer countries. Some studies were carried out during regular flu seasons, while a few were done during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Many participants did not always follow the assigned measures, and most studies had a high or unclear risk of bias.\n\nMasks versus no masks  \nWearing medical or surgical masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness or a confirmed viral infection. Harms and side‑effects were rarely measured.\n\nN95/P2 respirators versus medical/surgical masks  \nWhen N95 or P2 respirators were compared with regular masks, the evidence is uncertain about any change in overall respiratory illness. The respirators may reduce flu‑like illness a little, but we are not sure. For confirmed flu infection, they probably make little or no difference. Some participants reported discomfort while wearing the respirators.\n\nHand washing versus no hand washing  \nCleaning hands with soap or sanitizer probably reduces the overall chance of getting any acute respiratory infection. The effect on flu‑like illness or confirmed flu was unclear, and few studies reported any harms.\n\nNo studies were found that tested gowns, gloves, face shields, or screening at entry points.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies knew which protection they were using, and because many of the studies were small and participants often did not follow the measures as intended.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
