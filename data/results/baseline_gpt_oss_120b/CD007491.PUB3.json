Admission avoidance hospital at home means that a team of health‑care professionals provides the same active treatment in the person’s own home for a short, limited period, with the option to transfer to the hospital if needed. This approach could keep people out of the busy hospital environment, may be more comfortable, and could lower costs.  \n\nWhy did we look at this?  \nWe wanted to find out whether caring for people at home instead of admitting them to the hospital works as well, and whether it costs more or less, compared with ordinary inpatient hospital care.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for studies that compared admission avoidance hospital at home with regular hospital admission. We combined the results of the studies we found and judged how confident we could be in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 20 studies that together included about 3 100 adults. Some studies focused on people with chronic lung disease, a few on people recovering from stroke, and most on older adults with various acute medical problems. The studies were carried out in several countries and were generally well conducted, although a few did not report every detail we wanted.\n\nThe main findings were:  \n\n- For older adults, care at home probably does not change the chance of dying within six months compared with staying in the hospital.  \n- It also probably does not change the likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital within three to twelve months.  \n- However, receiving care at home probably cuts the chance of moving into a residential care home by about half.  \n- People’s own reports of their health status were about the same whether they were treated at home or in the hospital.  \n- Satisfaction with health‑care services may be better for those cared for at home, although the evidence for this is less certain.  \n- The length of the initial hospital stay was shorter when care was provided at home, but the certainty of this finding is low.  \n- Overall health‑service costs were probably lower for the home‑care approach, and there is some indication that total societal costs (including things like informal care) may also be reduced.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings about death, readmission, moving to residential care, health‑status reports, and health‑service costs because the studies were generally well done. We have less confidence in the results about satisfaction and length of stay because fewer studies looked at these outcomes and the data were less complete.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
