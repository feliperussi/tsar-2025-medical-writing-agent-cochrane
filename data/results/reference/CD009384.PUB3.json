  "text": "Is zinc supplementation effective for preventing death and disease, and for promoting growth, in children aged 6 months to 12 years and does it cause unwanted effects?\n\nKey messages\n‐ Zinc supplementation in children aged 6 months to 12 years makes little to no difference to all‐cause mortality and probably makes no difference to deaths from diarrea. Zinc supplementation probably reduces mortality due to lower respiratory tract infections and malaria but a small possibility of increased risk of mortality cannot be ruled out.\n‐ Zinc supplementation in children aged 6 months to 12 years might prevent illness due to diarrhea, but might lead to vomiting after supplementation. It might lead to a small increase in height gain.\nWhy is it important to study zinc supplementation?\n\nZinc is an essential micronutrient. It is important to help children grow normally and to promote a healthy immune system. Lack of zinc may lead to diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria and even death. Low dietary zinc intake is often linked to poverty. As many as half of all children in low‐ and middle‐income countries may have zinc deficiency. Meat, fish, eggs and dairy products are good natural sources of zinc, but are expensive. Lack of clean water and poor sanitation increases exposure to diseases, which zinc might help to fight. The human body cannot produce or store zinc, so giving dietary supplements is important.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements helps prevent child death and disease, and promotes growth.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that randomly assigned children aged 6 months to 12 years to receive zinc supplementation or no zinc.\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 96 studies in the review, with 219,584 children. Studies took place in 34, mainly low‐ to middle‐income countries. Most of the children in the studies were under five years old. Zinc was most commonly given as a syrup (zinc sulfate), and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily.\nWe found that giving children zinc supplementation might lead to a small to no reduction in the risk of death for any reason and the risk of death due to diarrhea. The risk of death due to lower respiratory tract infections or malaria may be reduced. Children given zinc experienced less disease due to diarrhea than children not given zinc; however, zinc does not seem to reduce children's risk of respiratory infection. Zinc supplementation may have a small positive effect on growth. Children who take zinc supplementation may experience vomiting as an unwanted effect.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are confident about our results on the effects of zinc supplements on reducing the risk of death due to any cause, illness due to respiratory infection, and occurrence of vomiting after supplementation. Our confidence in the results for our other outcomes was moderate because relatively few studies reported these outcomes and because studies sometimes reported different results from other studies for the same outcomes.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates a previous version published in 2014. The evidence is current to February 2022.",
