  "text": "What are the benefits and risks of different medications for Ménière's disease?\n\nKey messages\nDue to a lack of robust evidence, it is not clear whether any oral medicines (tablets) used to treat Ménière's disease work to improve people's symptoms, despite their routine use in clinical practice. When used for other conditions, these medications may cause side effects. However, there was too little information from the studies in Ménière’s disease for us to know if there are serious risks from these treatments.\nLarger, well‐conducted studies are needed in order to identify whether some medications may be effective, and assess whether there are any harmful effects of treatment.\nFurther work also needs to be done to find out how best to measure the symptoms of people with Ménière's disease, in order to assess whether treatments are beneficial or not. This should include the development of a 'core outcome set' ‐ a list of things that should be measured in all studies on Ménière's disease.\nWhat is Ménière's disease?\n\nMénière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear. It causes repeated attacks of dizziness or vertigo (a spinning sensation), together with hearing problems, tinnitus (ringing, humming or buzzing noises in the ears) and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear. It usually affects adults, and starts in middle age.\nHow is Ménière's disease treated?\n\nOral medications (tablets) are often used as the first treatment for Ménière's disease. Medications like betahistine and diuretics are commonly used, but other treatments have also been used, including corticosteroids and antiviral treatments. Other treatment options are also available (for example, injections into the ear or surgery).\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out:\n‐ whether there was evidence that any oral medications work at reducing the symptoms of Ménière's disease;\n‐ whether the treatments might cause any harm.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different types of treatment to either no treatment or sham (placebo) treatment.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 10 studies, which included a total of 848 people. They lasted between three months and two years. Most of the studies looked at treatment with betahistine, two studies looked at diuretics, one looked at corticosteroids and one looked at antivirals.\nBetahistine\nIt is unclear whether betahistine has an effect on vertigo symptoms. It is also unclear whether it causes any harm. Although we found several studies, many did not report on the things we were interested in, or reported them at very different times, so we were not able to combine the results of different studies to get a more accurate answer.\nDiuretics\nIt is also unclear whether diuretics have an effect on vertigo symptoms. We found no studies that reported on possible harms from this treatment.\nAntivirals and corticosteroids\nFor each we only found one small study that looked at these treatments, so we are very uncertain whether they have any effect on vertigo.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence because most of the studies conducted were very small and had problems in their conduct, which means that the results may be unreliable. This may be surprising, as some of these treatments are widely used for Ménière's disease. However, larger, well‐conducted studies are needed to try and work out how effective the different treatments really are.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is up‐to‐date to September 2022.",
