  "text": "Do strengthening exercises help in the treatment of people with patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee)?\n\nKey messages\n— The evidence for using strengthening exercises to treat patellar tendinopathy (pain at the front of the knee involving the tendon) is very uncertain, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n— For athletes, we are very uncertain whether exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment. Strengthening exercises may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment, and little or no difference to function and pain compared to glucocorticoid injections (anti‐inflammatory medications).\n— It is unclear if these exercises are better than surgery for reducing pain or improving function. Athletes reported similar treatment success and return to sport with strengthening exercises and surgery.\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy?\n\nPeople with patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) usually have pain and tenderness upon pressing the tendon at the front of the knee (connects muscles to bones). This frequently affects people in activities requiring repetitive jumping, braking, kicking, or running. Patellar tendinopathy can cause disability in both athletes and non‐athletes, significantly impacting athletic performance and career longevity.\nHow is patellar tendinopathy treated?\n\nOne of the main treatments for patellar tendinopathy is exercise, especially strengthening exercises. Other options include anti‐inflammatory medications (such as glucocorticoid injections) and, in some cases, surgery. Additional treatments that have been used include platelet‐rich plasma injections (a concentrated component of the blood injected into the knee), ultrasound therapy (which uses sound waves to reduce pain and support healing), laser therapy (which uses focused light to decrease pain and swelling, and speed up healing), and shockwave therapy (which uses high‐energy sound waves to stimulate healing and reduce pain).\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies comparing exercises with other treatments (such as no treatment, anti‐inflammatory medicines (for example, glucocorticoid injection), and surgery) in people with patellar tendinopathy. We collected data on pain, function, treatment success, quality of life, return to sport, and unwanted effects, and assessed how confident we were in the results.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found seven studies published between 1989 and 2022, and reported in English. Two studies were from Norway, and one each from Denmark, Germany, Greece, Poland, and the US.\nKey findings\nPain(measured between 0 and 100, lower scores mean less pain) at end of treatment.\nWe are very uncertain whether exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment.\n– People in the exercise group rated their pain as 27 points.\n– People in the no‐treatment group rated their pain as 62 points.\nExercise may make little or no difference to pain compared to glucocorticoid injection.\n– People in the exercise group rated their pain as 24 points.\n– People in the glucocorticoid injection group rated their pain as 18 points.\nWe are very uncertain whether exercise reduces pain compared to surgery.\n– People in the exercise group rated their pain as 13 points.\n– People in the surgery group rated their pain as 17 points.\nFunction(measured between 0 and 100, lower scores mean better function) at end of treatment.\nExercise may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment.\n– People in the exercise group rated their knee function as 72 points.\n– People in the no‐treatment group rated their knee function as 65 points.\nExercise may make little or no difference to function compared to glucocorticoid injection.\n– People in the exercise group rated their knee function as 76 points.\n– People in the glucocorticoid injection group rated their knee function as 82 points.\nWe are very uncertain whether exercise reduces function compared to surgery.\n– People in the exercise group rated their knee function as 52 points.\n– People in the surgery group rated their knee function as 45 points.\nTreatment success(measured from −5 to +5, +5 means maximum improvement) at the end of treatment.\nExercise may make little or no difference to treatment success compared to surgery.\n– People in the exercise group rated their success as 1.7 points.\n– People in the surgery group rated their success as 0.2 points.\nReturn to sport ratemeasured at 12 months.\nExercise may make little or no difference to the rate of return to sport compared to surgery.\n– 85 out of 100 people returned to sport after exercise treatment.\n– 86 out of 100 people returned to sport after surgery.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe effectiveness of strengthening exercises for athletes is uncertain. There were few studies of varying quality, with a small number of people. All studies only included athletes, so the results may not apply to people who are not athletes. No studies reported unwanted effects.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 5 September 2023.",
