  "text": "Home‐based versus supervised centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation\n\nReview question\nWe compared home‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes (including those that involve use of digital technology, such as websites and apps) with supervised centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with myocardial infarction (blood flow to the heart has stopped), angina (chest pain), heart failure (heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly) or who had undergone revascularisation (surgery to restore blood flow).\nBackground\nCardiac rehabilitation aims to restore people with heart disease to health, through a combination of exercise, education, and psychological support. Traditionally, centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes (e.g. based at a hospital, gymnasium or in community/sport centre) are offered to people after cardiac events. Home‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, which can include digital platforms, have been introduced to increase access and participation.\nSearch date\nWe searched up to September 2022.\nStudy characteristics\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (trials that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of home‐based (which may include digital/telehealth technology) versus supervised centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, in adults with heart disease.\nWe included 24 trials (3046 participants). We also found nine more studies and 14 trial registrations but they are ongoing or yet to be included in analyses. Most trials were relatively small (median 104 participants, range: 20 to 525). The average age of trial participants ranged from 51.6 to 69 years. Women accounted for only 19% of recruited participants; four trials did not include women. All trials included centre‐ and home‐based models of delivery that required supervision (either in person or remote) by healthcare professionals. Four trials used digital/telehealth technology to support their home‐based delivery.\nDiagnoses recruited for the trials varied: nine studies included a mixed population with coronary heart disease, six studies in those who had experienced a heart attack/myocardial infarction, four studies following revascularisation, and five in those with heart failure.\nKey results\nWe found that home‐ and centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are similar in benefits, measured in terms of numbers of deaths, exercise capacity and health‐related quality of life. Further data are needed to confirm if these short‐term effects of home/digital & telehealth‐ and centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation can be sustained over time.\nQuality of the evidence\nEvidence quality ranged from low (total mortality), to moderate (exercise capacity over 12 months and health‐related quality of life). The main reasons for the low assessment of quality was poor study reporting.",
