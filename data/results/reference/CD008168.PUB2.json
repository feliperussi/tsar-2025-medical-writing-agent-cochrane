  "text": "Intermittent phototherapy versus continuous phototherapy for neonatal jaundice\n\nReview question\nIn jaundiced newborn infants, is intermittent phototherapy compared with continuous phototherapy effective in reducing bilirubin levels.\nBackground\nNeonatal jaundice is a yellowish discolouration of the of the newborn infant's skin due to high bilirubin (a yellow compound that occurs naturally in the blood) levels. Phototherapy (light therapy) is widely accepted as an effective treatment for jaundiced newborn infants. Phototherapy is usually used continuously but intermittent phototherapy has some potential advantages such as improved maternal feeding and bonding. We do not know if intermittent phototherapy is as effective as continuous phototherapy.\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 33 studies that assessed the effect of intermittent phototherapy in infants through searches of medical databases up to January 2022. Of these, 12 studies (involving a total of 1600 infants) were eligible for inclusion in this review. One study is currently ongoing and four are awaiting classification. Our primary outcomes of interest were the rate of fall in the serum bilirubin levels and bilirubin‐induced brain dysfunction (BIND). Search is up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2022.\nKey results\nWe found little or no difference between intermittent phototherapy and continuous phototherapy in reducing bilirubin levels. Continuous phototherapy was more effective in preterm infants, however, we do not know if this is a meaningful difference. Intermittent phototherapy is associated with a decrease in the total number of hours of phototherapy exposure. There are theoretical benefits to intermittent regimens but there are important safety outcomes that were inadequately addressed.\nCertainty of evidence\nOverall, we rated the certainty of evidence as low or very low. Large, high‐quality trials are needed in both preterm and term infants before it can be concluded that intermittent and continuous phototherapy regimens are equally effective.",
