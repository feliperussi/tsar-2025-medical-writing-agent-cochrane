  "text": "Medicines for children with reflux\n\nReview question\nWhat is the best and safest treatment for babies and children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux?\nKey messages:\n‐ the evidence for medications for babies with gastro‐oesophageal reflux/reflux disease is very uncertain;\n‐ for children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, the evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of proton pump inhibitors. There was no adequate evidence to draw conclusions regarding other medications.\nWhat is gastro‐oesophageal reflux?\n\nGastro‐oesophageal reflux happens when stomach contents come back up into the oesophagus (food pipe). Most babies (under 1 year) grow out of reflux symptoms, but does medicine help? Children (older than 1 year) can have reflux just like adults. Reflux can be normal ('physiological reflux'), but in babies and children, it can cause symptoms, including pain or weight loss, as the oesophagus becomes inflamed (oesophagitis). Bothersome symptoms of reflux are called 'gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease' (GORD).\nHow is gastro‐oesophageal reflux treated?\n\nMedicines can thicken the stomach contents (alginates), neutralise stomach acid (ranitidine, omeprazole, lansoprazole), or help the stomach to empty faster (domperidone, erythromycin).\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to learn the best way to reduce reflux in babies and children. We wanted to see if medicines help infants and children to feel better (symptom scores), heal the oesophagus (which is checked by using endoscopy, where a tiny camera is put down the oesophagus), or lower the time the oesophagus is exposed to stomach acid. We also investigated whether the medicines were safe by considering the harmful or unwanted effects reported in the studies.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies testing gastro‐oesophageal reflux medicines in babies and children. We included all studies comparing these medicines, or comparing them to an inactive medicine (placebo). We assessed results which are important to doctors, nurses, and parents, and performed our own analysis of the results. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 36 suitable studies (involving 2251 babies and children), conducted worldwide, with most in the USA. The largest study recruited 268 babies, the smallest, 16 children. Fifteen studies compared an active medicine to placebo; 8 compared one active medication to another; and 11 studies gave the same medication at different doses. We found useable outcome information in 14 of the 36 studies. The remaining studies either did not report outcomes we were interested in or did not report them in a way we could analyse. We could not combine the results of any studies because they were too different (in terms of how long they followed participants up and the outcomes they investigated) to use in a meaningful way.\nKey results\nBabies.There is no clear effect on symptoms or measured acidity (one measure is reflux index, which is the percentage of time in 24 hours the oesophagus is exposed to stomach acid) between babies given omeprazole or placebo. One study (30 babies) showed cry/fuss time went down from 287 to 201 minutes/day in the placebo group and 246 to 191 minutes/day in the omeprazole group. Reflux index changed in the omeprazole group from 9.9% to 1.0% in 24 hours, and in the placebo group from 7.2% to 5.3%. One study (76 babies) showed that omeprazole and ranitidine may have a similar benefit for symptoms after 2 weeks: symptom scores (higher scores mean worse symptoms) in the omeprazole group dropped from 51.9 to 2.4, and in the ranitidine group, from 47 to 2.5. In one study of 52 newborn babies, esomeprazole appeared to show no reduction in the number of symptoms (184.7 to 156.7) compared to placebo (183.1 to 158.3). None of the studies reported harmful events or results about changes to babies' oesophaguses.\nChildren.In children older than 1 year of age, no studies assessed medical treatment versus placebo. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which block stomach acid production, at different doses may provide little to no improvements in symptoms or oesophagus healing. In one study (127 children), both lower‐weight and higher‐weight children given rabeprazole at lower and higher doses had both minimal – probably unimportant – changes in symptom scores and endoscopic scores (which indicate whether healing of the oesophagus has occurred). Pantoprazole may or may not improve symptom scores in children aged 1 to 5 years by week 8: there was no difference between lower and higher dosing in one study (60 children). Studies investigating other medications did not report enough information for us to assess their results properly.\nQuality of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence, which was mainly based on single studies with few babies and children. Several studies had pharmaceutical company help with manuscript writing. The question of how best to treat children with disabilities, and whether any PPIs are better than other medicines remain. The evidence is current to 17 September 2022.",
