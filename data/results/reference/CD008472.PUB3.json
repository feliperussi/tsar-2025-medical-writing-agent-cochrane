As an essential treatment strategy for severe artery disease, vascular surgery removes the deposits or repairs the bulge, but this carries an increased risk of death and complications. The high risk of surgery is mainly due to the obstruction and subsequent restoring of blood flow involved in the vascular surgery procedure, also known as 'ischaemia‐reperfusion injury'. Several approaches have been used to reduce the surgery risk, but have obtained limited effect.\nThe temporary blockage (by a few minutes) of blood flow to an organ can reduce injury in that organ (local ischaemic preconditioning) but may also reduce damage in other organs (remote ischaemic preconditioning, RIPC). Generally, RIPC is performed by frequently inflating and deflating using a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm or leg. As a safe and easy method, the effect of RIPC has been proven to prevent organ damage for heart surgery in animal studies.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether RIPC versus no RIPC can reduce death and organ injury in people undergoing vascular surgery, and if it may cause any harm.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at RIPC in people undergoing vascular surgery. We included studies with a randomised design (where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared RIPC with no RIPC. We compared and summarised the results of the included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 14 studies including 1295 people from the UK, Ireland, Estonia, Spain, China, the USA, Singapore, and New Zealand. The average age ranged from 65 to 76 years. The majority of the participants (84%) were men. The overall methodological quality of the studies was acceptable.\nIn people undergoing vascular surgery, compared to no RIPC:\n• RIPC probably leads to little or no difference in death (10 studies, 965 people), heart attack (11 studies, 1001 people), kidney injury (12 studies, 1054 people), and stroke (4 studies, 392 people), and may lead to little or no difference in limb loss (3 studies, 322 people); and\n• RIPC probably leads to little or no difference in hospital stay (7 studies, 569 people) and operating time (10 studies, 803 people).\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in our findings is only moderate due to concerns about the following factors: firstly, the evidence was based on a few cases such as for death and limb loss, and some studies were small; secondly, the studies used different methods to detect outcomes such as kidney injury; and finally, for some results, such as heart attack, some of the studies conducted in the area have not made their results public yet, preventing an objective picture of all the available evidence (publication bias). The results of further research may differ from the results of this review, which means our conclusions could change as more research is reported.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates a previous Cochrane Review. The evidence is current to 1 April 2022.",
