Participating in exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions from any cause and heart failure‐related hospital admissions, and likely results in important improvements in health‐related quality of life assessed by the 'Minnesota Living with Heart Failure' questionnaire.\n‐ Importantly, this updated review provides additional evidence supporting the use of alternative modes of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation delivery, including home‐based and digitally‐supported programmes.\n‐ Future studies should recruit people not usually represented in studies, such as older patients and women with heart failure, and people with preserved ejection fraction heart failure.\nWhat is heart failure?\n\nHeart failure is when your heart can't pump blood around your body as well as it should. People with heart failure experience fatigue and shortness of breath. This makes doing everyday activities difficult and can affect people's quality of life. People with heart failure are at increased risk of hospital admission and death.\nWhat is cardiac rehabilitation?\n\nCardiac rehabilitation aims to help people recover from heart problems, including heart failure. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes can involve exercise training and may also provide education on lifestyle and risk factor management, plus counselling and psychological support.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if exercise‐based rehabilitation was better than no exercise to improve:\n‐ deaths\n‐ hospital admission\n‐ health‐related quality of life\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that assessed the effects of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation in people with heart failure. We compared and summarised the results of relevant studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted in countries around the world. About 40% of the people came from 2 large studies. All studies lasted for around 6 months or longer.\nParticipation in exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation:\n• likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions from any cause and due to heart failure up to 12 months from the start of the study;• probably makes little to no difference in the risk of death from any cause;• likely improves health‐related quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire.\nThe effects of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation appear to be consistent:\n• whether they are delivered in a hospital or medical centre, or are home‐based;• regardless of the amount of exercise or whether the programme also includes other components such as education or counselling;• regardless of the type of training (just aerobic or aerobic plus resistance training).\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because not all the studies used robust methods. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of alternative models of exercise‐based rehabilitation relative to traditional centre‐based programmes, especially home‐based and digitally supported programmes. Future studies need to consider the generalisability of trial populations (women, older people, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remain under‐represented in trial populations), the application of interventions to enhance long‐term maintenance of exercise training and outcome, and costs.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous 2018 review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
