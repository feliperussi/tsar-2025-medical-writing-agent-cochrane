  "text": "Re‐feeding versus discarding gastric residuals to improve growth in preterm infants\n\nReview question\nDoes re‐feeding (giving again) stomach aspirates (partially digested milk and gut hormones withdrawn from feeding tube) in premature babies promote growth without causing feeding problems?\nKey messages\n• Limited evidence suggests re‐feeding stomach aspirates in premature babies may have little or no effect on important outcomes such as:\n• the occurrence of severe intestinal disease that causes damage and death of intestinal tissue and may result in a hole in the premature baby's intestine (necrotising enterocolitis);\n• time to regain birth weight;\n• time to establish full enteral feeds (milk fed either orally or via a tube into the stomach or small bowel);\n• number of days total parenteral nutrition (feeding through vein); and\n• death before discharge.\n• The available evidence is insufficient to assess the potential benefits, as well as the possible risks, of re‐feeding of stomach aspirates in premature babies.\nBackground\nIt is common practice to monitor the stomach aspirates of preterm infants on tube feeds. Tube feeding means that the baby is fed through a small soft tube which is either placed in their nose or mouth and runs down their throat through the food pipe (oesophagus) to their stomach. The baby's stomach aspirates are monitored to identify possible feed intolerance (difficulty in digesting feeds) and necrotising enterocolitis. There is no agreement on whether to re‐feed or discard the stomach aspirates. Re‐feeding the aspirates may replace the partially digested milk and gut hormones that are necessary for gut maturity. However, re‐feeding abnormal aspirates may result in vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis, or infection. We looked for evidence from clinical trials that assessed whether re‐feeding stomach aspirates is beneficial or harmful in premature babies.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether re‐feeding stomach aspirates helps or harms premature babies.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated re‐feeding of stomach aspirates in premature babies. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the size of the study and the methods used.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found only one small study with 72 premature babies that investigated this question. Re‐feeding stomach aspirates may have little or no effect on important outcomes such as the occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, death before discharge, time to establish full feeds, number of total parenteral nutrition days, and in‐hospital weight gain. We did not find information on other outcomes.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nMore studies are needed before we will be able to tell whether re‐feeding is helpful or harmful to premature babies.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe search is up‐to‐date as of February 2022.",
