  "text": "Do dietary and activity strategies help prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years?\n\nKey messages\n‐ Strategies for changing activity levels, or both activity levels and diet, of children to help prevent them developing overweight or obesity might be effective in making small reductions in body mass index (BMI) in children aged 5 to 11 years.\n‐ There is very little information about whether the strategies resulted in serious adverse events (e.g. injuries), but from what we found there appears to be little or no effect.\n‐ This change in BMI, when provided to many children across a whole population, is useful for parents concerned about their children becoming overweight as they move into adulthood and for governments in trying to tackle the problems of obesity through the life course.\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\n\nMore children are developing overweight and obesity worldwide. Being overweight as a child can cause health problems, and people may be affected psychologically and in their social life. Children that are overweight are likely to be overweight as adults and continue to experience poor physical and mental health. Indeed, childhood obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes and heart disease in adulthood and middle‐age mortality.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if strategies to help people modify their diet or activity (or both) are effective at preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. We also wanted to find out if these strategies were associated with any serious adverse events.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched many scientific databases to find studies that looked at ways of preventing obesity in children. We included studies aimed at children aged 5 to 11 years. We did not include studies only aimed at children who were already overweight or were already living with obesity. However, we included studies in which children who were overweight or living with obesity were included in the analysis. We only included studies if the methods they used were aimed at changing children's diet, or their level of activity (i.e. increasing physical activity or reducing inactive time), or both. We looked only for studies that randomly placed people into groups receiving different strategies (which may include changing nothing). We assessed the rigour of the studies to get a sense of how confident we were in their results. We grouped studies together for analysis depending on whether they aimed to improve diet, activity, or both.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 172 studies that involved 189,707 children. One hundred forty‐six studies were based in high‐income countries (e.g. the USA and in Europe). In 111 studies, the strategies were tried in schools, though 15 were based in the community, eight in the home and seven in clinical settings; one intervention was conducted by telehealth and 31 studies were conducted in more than one setting. Eighty‐six strategies were implemented for less than nine months, with the shortest being conducted over one visit and the longest over four years. Non‐industry funding was declared by 132 studies; 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry (e.g. food suppliers, pharmaceutical industry and private healthcare services).\nOur statistical analyses included results from 149 studies of 160,267 children. We found that children who were helped with a strategy to change their activity levels alone or in combination with a strategy to change their diet may have their BMI reduced, compared with children who were not given any strategy. This means that these children may have been able to minimise their excess weight gain by a small amount which, for public health, is important. In contrast, children who were helped with a strategy to change their diet only did not have their BMI reduced.\nOnly a few studies reported any possible harms of the strategies, and no serious harms were identified in these.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low. However, it is difficult to be confident that funding more studies, at least more school‐based studies, would produce a much higher level of confidence in the results.\nFour main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence.\n1. Results were very inconsistent across the different studies.\n2. A lot of the studies had limitations in how they were done.\n3. There were not enough studies reporting particular types of outcomes for a particular duration of follow‐up to be certain about the results for some comparisons, and also certain settings (e.g. community settings) were under‐represented.\n4. Results from some studies were not reported in a way such that we could include them in our analyses (e.g. without any detail of the difference between the strategies examined) and this may have an impact on the results of our analyses.\nThis review does not provide sufficient information to be able to assess how well strategies work for children with disabilities, or whether those implemented in community settings are effective.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up‐to‐date to February 2023.",
