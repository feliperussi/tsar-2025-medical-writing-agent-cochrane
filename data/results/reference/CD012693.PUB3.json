  "text": "How effective are individualised doses of hormones for women trying to become pregnant through in vitro fertilisation (IVF)?\n\nKey messages\nWe did not find clear evidence to support or reject the use of ovarian reserve tests (ORTs) to select the stimulation dose, for either live birth or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\nFuture studies could evaluate the impact of using ORTs to select the stimulation dose, over several treatment attempts.\nWhat is individualised stimulation in IVF treatment?\n\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of assisted reproductive technology where eggs are combined with sperm outside a woman’s body. During a typical IVF cycle, doctors give women hormones that encourage a group of eggs to mature. This is referred to as ovarian stimulation.\nIn planning an IVF cycle, the dose of ovarian stimulation medicines is based on certain characteristics of each woman, such as age. New tests have been developed that may better predict a woman's response to stimulation, called ovarian reserve tests (ORTs). They measure the number of eggs available in the ovaries. It is unclear whether tailoring doses of stimulation medicines based on individual ORTs can help increase the chance of getting pregnant and having a baby, or whether the tests help to improve the safety of the IVF cycle, such as reducing the chances of the serious condition OHSS.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to establish if ovarian hormone stimulation tailored to individual women based on certain characteristics was better than standard doses for:\n‐ helping women have a live birth;\n‐ avoiding OHSS;\n‐ helping women achieve a pregnancy.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared individualised ovarian stimulation dosing to standard dosing or to another type of individualised dosing. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 26 studies involving 8520 women. We grouped these into two comparisons:\n‐ direct dose comparison studies recruited women predicted to respond to IVF stimulation either poorly, normally, or excessively, based on their ovarian reserve test. Women were then randomly assigned to different doses of ovarian‐stimulating hormones to see whether the different doses would affect IVF outcomes.\n‐ ORT‐based dose selection studies divided women into those whose stimulation dose was based on the women's ORT and those receiving a standard dose or one based on another characteristic.\nMain results for direct dose comparison studies\nFor women predicted to respond poorly or normally to stimulation based on their ovarian reserve test, it was unclear whether increasing the dose of stimulation medication influenced the chance of getting pregnant, having a baby, or the chance of OHSS. However, the included studies were small and compared different doses of medication. For women predicted to respond poorly, if the chance of having a live birth after taking 150 international units (IU) of hormone is 16%, the chance with 300 or 450 IU would be between 13% to 26%. For women predicted to have a normal response, if the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy with 150 IU is 29%, the chance with 200/225 IU would be between 22% to 36%.\nFor women predicted to have an excessive response to stimulation, reducing the stimulation dose may or may not affect the chance of having a baby. If the chance of live birth with 100 IU is 25%, the chance with 150 IU would be between 18% to 33%. Reducing the dose may reduce the rate of OHSS. If the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a lower dose is 1.6%, the chance with a higher dose would be between 1.3% and 9.6%, but this is also unclear.\nMain results for ORT‐based dose selection studies\nThere was no notable reduction in ongoing pregnancy or live birth when using ORTs to select a dose, but it is unclear whether there is a benefit. Different methods of using ORT to select the dose might be more or less effective compared to others. If the chance of an ongoing pregnancy or live birth with a standard starting dose were 25%, the chance with dosing based on an ORT would be between 25% and 31%. Individualised dosing did appear to reduce the chance of having OHSS when compared to giving all women the same dose of stimulation medication, but we have little confidence in this evidence. If the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a standard starting dose were 5%, the chance with dosing based on an ovarian reserve test would be between 2% and 5%.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low to low, due to limitations in study design (researchers and participants often knew which treatment was assigned) and statistical imprecision, as the studies included too few women to provide clear results for the most important outcomes, such as having a baby.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2023.",
