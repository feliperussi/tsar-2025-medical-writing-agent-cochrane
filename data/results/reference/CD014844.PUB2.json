  "text": "Antibiotics to prevent infection after surgery to manage miscarriage Key messages We are uncertain whether routine antibiotics have any effect on the risk of getting a uterine infection (infection in the womb) after surgery to manage a miscarriage, based on the combined results from all six trials. However, based on the results from only the well‐done trials (85% of the total number of women in the studies), we are confident that routine antibiotics reduce the risk of getting a uterine infection after surgery to manage a miscarriage. We are uncertain whether routine antibiotics have any effect on the risk of vomiting and diarrhoea, but they may increase the risk of an allergic reaction. We are uncertain about other effects of routine antibiotics, such as future treatment and hospitalisation for a uterine infection. What is miscarriage or early pregnancy loss? Early pregnancy loss (previously called miscarriage) is the unintended loss of a baby before 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Almost one in six women will lose a baby during pregnancy in their lifetime. Worldwide, it is estimated that 23 million early pregnancy losses occur every year, which equates to 44 early pregnancy losses every minute. Early pregnancy loss can be managed in three ways: women can wait for the remaining pregnancy tissue to pass by itself, they can take medicine to help expel the tissue, or they can undergo a procedure to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus. Procedures to manage early pregnancy loss (previously referred to as surgical management or uterine evacuation) are commonly performed, but increase the risk of women developing an infection in the womb when compared to other ways of treating early pregnancy loss.   Infection after early pregnancy loss has been reported to be as high as 30% in some low‐income countries. It can cause death and disability. It can also have long‐term consequences for fertility.  Antibiotics are routinely given before or during many surgical procedures to prevent the development of an infection (known as antibiotic prophylaxis). This includes procedures to perform an abortion (also known as a termination of pregnancy).  What did we want to find out? We wanted to evaluate whether giving antibiotics around the time of the procedure to manage early pregnancy loss would help lower the women's risk of infection, and whether their routine use was associated with any serious side effects. What did we do? We collected and analysed all relevant studies from the medical literature to answer this question. We identified six randomised studies (everyone had the same chance of receiving one of the treatments). They were carried out across eight countries, and included 4371 women who had procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. The women were given either antibiotics, a placebo (fake antibiotics), or no treatment.  What did we find out? When we combined the results from all six studies, we were uncertain whether routine antibiotics made any difference in the risk of getting a uterine infection. However, when we only looked at the combined findings from the three studies that were well conducted, and which included 85% of the women, we are confident that routine antibiotics reduce the risk of infection in the uterus after procedures for early pregnancy loss. We cannot be certain whether routine antibiotics reduce future hospitalisation for the treatment of infection, or reduce the need for further antibiotics to treat infection. What are the limitations of the evidence? Not all the women stayed in their studies until the end; some did not finish their medicine. There was limited information on the side effects of the antibiotics, such as vomiting, diarrhoea, and allergic reactions, both mild and severe. How up‐to‐date is the evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to October 2023.",
