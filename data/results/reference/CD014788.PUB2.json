  "text": "Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogues for pain associated with endometriosis\n\nWhat are the benefits and risks of gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) for pain associated with endometriosis?\nKey messages\nGnRHas offer more pain reduction compared to placebo or progestogens. However, the largest decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) was found when using GnRHas, compared to a different hormone called gestrinone and GnRHas together with calcium‐regulating agents (acting on bone).\nMost adverse effects were hot flushes for patients treated with GnRHas or gestrinone (hormone) and weight gain when treated with danazol (hormone).\nFurther, well‐designed research is needed to provide better understanding of the benefits and risks of using GnRHas and other hormonal treatment options for pain associated with endometriosis.\nWhat is endometriosis?\n\nEndometriosis is a common condition, affecting women of childbearing age, and is usually due to the presence of endometrial‐like tissue in places other than the uterus. The most reported symptoms are pain and infertility.\nWhat are GnRHas?\n\nGnRHas are a group of drugs often used to treat endometriosis. GnRHas are a synthetic form of the hormone gonadorelin, released by the hypothalamus in the brain. They stimulate the pituitary gland in the brain to produce luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), both reproductive hormones. These reproductive hormones further stimulate the production of progesterone and oestrogen in the ovaries, the hormones that control your menstrual cycle.\nHowever, continued use of GnRHas results in a suppression of ovarian function and therefore reduces oestrogen and progesterone levels. This will in turn result in a decrease of endometrial tissue and therefore reduce complaints of endometriosis.\nBecause GnRHas temporarily stop the production of reproductive hormones, they mimic symptoms of menopause, including a decrease in bone mineral density (the amount of calcium and other minerals present in your bones).\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nIn the current review, we looked at women with endometriosis, who were treated with GnRHas, and compared this treatment with other forms of hormonal treatment.\nWe wanted to find out if GnRHas were better than any other hormonal treatment to improve pain and to see their effect on bone mineral density.\nAdditionally, we wanted to find out if GnRHas were associated with an improved quality of life and also unveil any unwanted effects.\nWhat did we do?\n\nThe review involved searching for studies that investigated the effect of GnRHas compared with placebo (dummy treatment) and other hormonal treatment in women with endometriosis. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 72 trials that involved 7355 women with endometriosis.\n‐ A difference in overall pain, reported as pain reduction was seen in favour of GnRHas compared to placebo. We also saw that women treated with GnRHas had less pelvic pain reduction and an increase in endometriotic lesions after six months of treatment, compared to danazol.\n‐ After six months of treatment, there was a greater decrease of pain for women treated with GnRHas compared to gestrinone.\n‐ No difference was seen in pain scores between women treated with GnRHas compared to other hormonal treatment options.\n‐ Most adverse effects were seen in women treated with GnRHas compared to placebo (hot flushes), with danazol (weight gain) and gestrinone (hot flushes).\n‐ A greater decrease in bone mineral density was found in GnRHas compared to gestrinone and GnRHas in conjunction with calcium‐regulating agents.\n‐ For the other comparisons examined in the current review, we are uncertain of the effect between the examined groups. It should be noted, however, that the evidence was often of (very) low quality in the analyses undertaken for the other comparisons.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe included studies were of low quality mainly due to poor reporting of study methods and the inaccuracy with which the results were reported.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2022.",
