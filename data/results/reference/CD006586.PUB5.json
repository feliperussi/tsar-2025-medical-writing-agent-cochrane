  "text": "Birth control pills with drospirenone for treating premenstrual syndrome\n\nReview question\nWe wanted to find out whether birth control pills containing drospirenone and oestrogen were effective in improving premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms in women with PMS, compared to either a placebo ('dummy') pill or another birth control pill. We also wanted to find out what side effects the women might experience.\nBackground\nPMS is a common problem. A severe form is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms could include behaviour changes, and physical signs and symptoms that impact daily life. Birth control pills with the hormones progestin and oestrogen to treat these symptoms have been studied. A birth control pill with drospirenone combined with low‐dose oestrogen was approved in the USA for treating PMDD.\nStudy characteristics\nWe found five trials with 858 women. All the trials compared a dummy pill to a drospirenone with low oestrogen pill. A majority of the women had PMDD, the severe form of PMS, before the trial. The evidence is current to June 2022.\nKey results\nAfter three months, women on the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill had less severe premenstrual symptoms than the group taking the dummy pill. Women on the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill said they could do more, and had more social activities and friends. However, women on the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill were more likely to pull out of the trials due to side effects. They reported more side effects overall; specifically, nausea, bleeding between periods, and breast pain, which are all common side effects with birth control pills. We do not know if the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill works longer than three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other birth control pills.\nThe beneficial effects from the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill on premenstrual symptoms were small to moderate, although there was significant benefit from the dummy pill too. The evidence suggests that if the chance of pulling out of the trials due to side effects while on the dummy pill is assumed to be 3%, the chance while on the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill would be between 6% and 16%. It also suggests that if the risk of having side effects from the dummy pill is assumed to be 28%, the risk from the drospirenone with low oestrogen pill would be between 40% and 54%.\nQuality of the evidence\nThe evidence was of very low to moderate quality. The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting of trial methods, and lack of precision and consistency in the findings.",
