  "text": "Medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nKey messages\nWe found that while corticosteroids may improve patients' symptoms, they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells (eosinophils) and they may improve what the disease looks like under visual inspection (endoscopy), when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo (dummy treatment).\nWe found that biologics (a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat disease) may improve patients' symptoms, that they certainly reduce the amount of allergic cells, and that they may be no different in terms of what the disease looks like under visual inspection, when compared to placebo, for children and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be just as safe as a placebo.\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a long‐term allergic condition in which the esophagus becomes inflamed (sore), which can lead to difficulty swallowing, vomiting, heartburn, and chest and stomach pain. Particles in foods or the air cause the immune system to have an allergic reaction and produce immune cells, which are called eosinophils. These build up in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth with the stomach. Eosinophilic esophagitis was first identified in the 1990s and since then it has been recognized as a major digestive illness. It is not known what causes it, but it might be related to genetics combined with environmental triggers. People with eosinophilic esophagitis tend to have other allergies as well. Currently, there is no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis, making long‐term treatment necessary. Standard treatments include diets, stretching of the esophagus (dilation), and drugs such as corticosteroids, biological medications, and proton pump inhibitor medications.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if the available medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis work for improving patients' symptoms, reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope, and improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also wanted to find out how safe they are and if they improve quality of life.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any medical treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis with any other medical treatment, in both adults and children.What did we find?\n\nWe found 41 studies with 3253 participants. Eleven studies were in children only while the rest were in a mix of children and adults. We identified 19 comparisons. In this summary, we present the results of the two main comparisons: corticosteroids compared to placebo and biologics compared to placebo.\nWe found that corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. We are highly certain that corticosteroids are better than placebo at reducing the amount of eosinophils (allergic cells) when measured under a microscope. Corticosteroids may be better than placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination (endoscopy). We also found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to leave a study due to unwanted or harmful effects (side effects), and that they probably experience a similar number of both serious side effects and side effects in total, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between corticosteroids and placebo in the improvement of quality of life.\nWe found that biologics may be better than placebo at improving patients' symptoms. It is likely that biologics are better than placebo at reducing the amount of allergic cells when measured under a microscope. Biologics may be no different to placebo at improving what the disease looks like under visual examination. We also found that people on biologics may be equally likely to leave a study due to side effects, or have serious side effects, and may experience similar numbers of total side effects, compared to placebo. There may be no difference between biologics and placebo in the improvement of quality of life.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe evidence in children only was quite limited and we do not know if the conclusions above can definitely apply to children specifically. Another limitation of the evidence is that the outcomes were measured in many different ways, which may have weakened our conclusions. Other treatments used by the participants were also something that varied a lot between people, and may have affected our conclusions. Finally, we were limited in the conclusions we could make about the effects of sex, age, extent of disease, dosage, and type of corticosteroid or biologic.\nHow up‐to‐date is this review?\n\nThis review is up‐to‐date to 3 March 2023.",
