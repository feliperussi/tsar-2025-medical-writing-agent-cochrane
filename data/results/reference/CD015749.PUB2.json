  "text": "What are the benefits and risks of using a combination of treatments to manage cachexia (disease‐related wasting)?\n\nKey messages:\n• We do not know if combinations of two or more treatments (of medication, diet, and exercise) benefit people who have or are at risk of developing cachexia (disease‐related wasting). This is because there are currently not enough robust studies in this area.\n• We need future research to increase our confidence in the evidence by conducting better designed and larger studies.\nWhat is cachexia?\n\nCachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome that occurs in people with long‐term illnesses (known as chronic illnesses), such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nPeople who have cachexia may:\n• lose weight unintentionally;• lose muscle;• feel tired, weak, or both;• lose their appetite.\nCachexia affects well‐being and can be life‐threatening.\nHow is cachexia treated?\n\nStudies are investigating how to best manage cachexia with different treatments. These treatments can include medications, diet, and exercise, provided in a single (unimodal) or combined (multimodal) treatment. It is thought that due to the complex biology of cachexia, a combination of treatments may work in a complementary way (synergistically) to help improve the symptoms associated with cachexia and people's well‐being, extend life, or both.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if combining at least two treatments (out of diet, exercise, and medication) helped to improve: physical function and strength; muscle loss; weight; well‐being; appetite; fatigue; and biological indicators within the blood (biochemical markers). We also wanted to find out if these interventions were associated with any unwanted or harmful (adverse) effects.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared treatment combinations of diet, exercise and/or medication (where at least two treatments were used together) to: different combinations of treatments; a single treatment; or treatment as usual (standard care) in adults with cachexia or at risk of developing cachexia. We compared and summarised the results of the included studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and the number of people included.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found nine studies that included a total of 926 adults, with an average age of 63 years. Just over half of participants (57%) were men. Studies took place around the world, including Europe (six studies), Turkey (one study), New Zealand (one study), and the USA (one study). One study included people with HIV/AIDS (average age 43 years; 35 of 50 people in the study were men); one study included people with COPD (average age 72 years; 20 of 28 people in the study were men); and one study included people with chronic kidney disease (average age 70 years; 11 of 21 in the study were men). Six studies included people with cancer (average age 64 years; 461 of 893 people in the studies were men). The studies lasted six weeks to two years.\nThe studies used combinations of treatments which could have included diet, exercise, and/or medication, where at least two treatments were used together, and compared these to:\n• treatment as usual (1 study, 46 people);• different combinations of treatments (4 studies, 192 people);• a single treatment (6 studies, 802 people).\nThe studies did not provide enough robust evidence to determine if multimodal interventions are associated with benefits or harms in people with or at risk of cachexia.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because not all the studies provided information about everything that we were interested in. Additionally, the studies used different ways of measuring results, and most of the studies included only small numbers of people.\nImportantly, future studies may change the conclusions of this review.\nHow current is this review?\n\nThe evidence is current to June 2024.",
