The evidence is very uncertain whether antibiotics or topical antiseptics are more effective for reducing ear discharge, except that topical antibiotics are likely to be more effective than boric acid (an antiseptic).\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\n\nChronic suppurative otitis media is a long‐term (chronic) swelling and infection of the middle ear, with ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane (where the eardrum has a hole or tear in it). The main symptoms of chronic suppurative otitis media are ear discharge (pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum) and hearing loss.\nHow can chronic suppurative otitis media be treated?\n\nAntibiotics (which kill bacteria) are the most commonly used treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media. Antibiotics can either be 'topical' (put into the ear canal as ear drops, ointments, sprays, or creams) or 'systemic' (taken either by mouth or by an injection into a muscle or vein). Topical antiseptics (antiseptics put directly into the ear as ear drops or powders) are a possible treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media. Both antibiotics and topical antiseptics kill or stop the growth of the germs that may be responsible for the infection.\nAntibiotics and topical antiseptics can be used on their own or added to other treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media, such as other antibiotics or ear cleaning (called aural toileting). It was important in this review to examine whether there were any unwanted effects from using antibiotics and antiseptics, such as irritation of the skin within the outer ear, which may cause discomfort, pain, or itching. Some antibiotics and antiseptics (such as alcohol) can also be toxic to the inner ear (called ototoxicity), which means that they may cause permanent hearing loss, dizziness, or ringing in the ear (called tinnitus).\nWhat was the aim of this review?\n\nWe wanted to compare antibiotics and antiseptics for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. In particular, we wanted to know whether they stopped ear discharge, and whether they affected people's quality of life or hearing. We also wanted to know if they caused pain, discomfort, or irritation in the ear; had unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding; or any serious complications. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and consistency of results.\nWhat were the main results of the review?\n\nWe found 15 studies, which included 2371 people, that compared antibiotics to a variety of antiseptics (acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‐iodine, and aluminium acetate). One study recruited only children, two studies recruited only adults, and 12 studies included both adults and children. About 40 in every 100 people were females. We presented the main comparisons below.\nComparison of antibiotics to acetic acid\nWe included seven studies (835 people). We have little to no confidence in the evidence of whether topical antibiotics or acetic acid improved ear discharge in people with chronic suppurative otitis media. It was not possible to know whether there was a difference between treatments for any other symptoms or effects that we were interested in.\nComparison of antibiotics to boric acid\nWe included two studies (532 people). Topical antibiotics (quinolones) are likely to be better than boric acid at reducing ear discharge after one to two weeks. There may also be less ear discomfort (pain, irritation, and bleeding). Topical quinolones may result in a greater improvement in hearing compared to topical boric acid, but this difference may be too small for the person to notice a difference.\nComparison of antibiotics to povidone‐iodine\nWe included one study (40 people). We have little to no confidence in the evidence of whether topical or systemic antibiotics or povidone‐iodine improve the resolution of ear discharge in people with chronic suppurative otitis media. It was not possible to know whether there was a difference between treatments for any other symptoms or effects that we were interested in.\nComparison of antibiotics to aluminium acetate\nWe included one study (51 people) that stated there was improvement in ear discharge at two to four weeks, but they did not present their results in a way that we could use. It was not possible to know whether there was a difference between treatments for any other symptoms or effects that we were interested in.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe studies were small with many being poorly reported, and results varied widely between studies. We also need more information about harmful effects.\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThis is the first update of a review published in 2020. The evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
