  "text": "Non‐immunosuppressive treatment for IgA nephropathy\n\nKey messages\nTreatment with renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition, namely angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, is the most common first‐line, non‐immunosuppressive therapy used for managing patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN).\nThe role of other non‐immunosuppressive treatments in managing IgAN is unclear and warrants further clinical studies.\nWhy treat IgA nephropathy with non‐immunosuppressive therapies?\n\nIgAN is one of the most common kidney diseases, leading to reduced kidney function and kidney failure for about 20% to 40% of patients within 20 to 25 years. The cause of IgAN is not widely understood, but most people have an abnormality in their immune system that leads to damage to the kidney. However, other non‐immune functions play a role in the disease's impact on the kidney.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if non‐immunosuppressive treatments (e.g. antihypertensive agents, anticoagulants, fish oil, tonsillectomy, herbal medicine) improved kidney function in adults and children with IgAN.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of randomly allocated non‐immunosuppressive treatment in people with IgAN. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 80 studies involving 4856 people with IgAN treated with a diverse collection of non‐immunosuppressive treatments. Patients in studies were given various therapies, including blood pressure lowering agents (antihypertensives), removal of participant's tonsils (tonsillectomy), antimalarials, traditional Chinese medicine, dietary supplements (e.g. fish oil), and vitamin D receptor agonists. Antihypertensive medication aimed at inhibiting the RAS appears to slow damage to the kidney with minimal side effects. However, its impact in preventing people from progressing to kidney failure is unclear. Other interventions, such as tonsillectomy, antimalarial medication, and low‐calorie restricted diets role in treating patients are still unclear.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe small number of studies per comparison and the small size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in. We are unsure about the results.\nHow up to date is the evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date as of December 2023.",
