  "text": "Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease\n\nReview question\nAre there any safe and effective interventions that prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease (SCD)?\nBackground\nSCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc‐shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent‐shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.\nKidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes.\nSearch date\nThe evidence is current to 22 September 2022.\nStudy characteristics\nWe found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine). The third trial, published in 2020, compared lisinopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years.\nTwo trials received government funding; it was unclear how the third trial was funded.\nKey results\nIn children aged nine to 18 months, hydroxyurea may increase the ability to produce normal urine, but we are unsure if it has any effect on the glomerular filtration rate (network of filters in the kidney that filter waste from the blood). Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to the occurrence of serious complications including acute chest syndrome (pain, cough, fever, low oxygen levels, and abnormal substances in the lungs), painful crises, and hospitalisations.\nWe are unsure if giving captopril to adults with SCD who have normal blood pressure and early signs of kidney damage (microalbuminuria) reduces progression of kidney damage.\nWe are unsure if giving lisinopril to children aged one to 18 years with SCD who have normal blood pressure and early signs of kidney damage (microalbuminuria) reduces progression of kidney damage.\nNo trials reported quality of life.\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little or very little confidence in the evidence because we only found three trials, and they had specific populations (only children or only adults), few participants, and wide variations in results.",
