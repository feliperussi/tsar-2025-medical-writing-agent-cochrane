  "text": "What is the best method for rescuing clotted haemodialysis access? Key messages • There was insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention was better than another for the outcomes of failure, function at 30 days, technical success and adverse events (both major and minor). • Function at 30 days may improve with surgical compared to mechanical thrombectomy; however, the evidence is very uncertain. • Death, access dysfunction, successful dialysis, and SONG (Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology) outcomes were rarely reported. Why is it important to treat thrombosed (clotted) haemodialysis access? When kidneys no longer work properly, dialysis (a process for cleaning the blood) is required. To connect to a dialysis machine, access is required via an entry point to the blood. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) is a connection between an artery and a vein, and is used as this access point. If a blood clot forms, it may reduce the blood flow through this access. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out what is the best method for treating clots in haemodialysis AVF or AVG. What did we do? We searched for randomised trials that looked at interventions used for treating thrombosed dialysis access. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and size. What did we find? We included 14 studies randomising 1176 people with thrombosed haemodialysis access. We included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: (1) types of thrombectomy (thrombus removal), (2) types of thrombolysis (thrombus dissolution) and (3) surgical procedures. Most of the included studies had poor study design, low numbers of patients, and some had pharmaceutical industry funding. The surgical procedure in thrombosed AVF may be associated with better results at 30 days. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention is better to ensure adequate dialysis. There is insufficient evidence of which interventions have a lower risk of complications. What are the limitations of the evidence? The small number of studies per comparison and the small size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in. We are unsure about the results. How up‐to‐date is the evidence? The evidence is up to date as of January 2024.",
