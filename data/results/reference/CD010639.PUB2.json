  "text": "Changing shift worker's schedules to improve sleep quality and duration and reduce sleepiness Key messages • There is limited evidence that changes in shift schedules improve sleep quality, increase sleep duration, or reduce sleepiness. • More studies are needed to draw stronger conclusions about shift schedule changes on sleep and sleepiness. What can be done to improve shift workers' sleep? Shift work often leads to insufficient sleep that can compromise worker alertness, with ultimate effects on health and work safety. Changing shift work schedules is one method that may reduce the unwanted effects of shift work. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which shift schedule adaptations improve sleep on rest days and reduce sleepiness at work. What did we do? We searched for studies that evaluated the following features of shift schedules. • Whether shift schedules changed (rotated) or stayed the same • Whether shift changes were regular or irregular • Direction of shift rotation (morning to afternoon to night or night to afternoon to morning) • Speed of rotation • Shift duration • Timing of start of shifts • Distribution of shift schedule (fewer shifts with more hours or more shifts with fewer hours) • Time off between shifts • Split (interrupted) shifts • Whether workers had on‐call shifts • Whether workers were involved in organising the shift schedule What did we find? We included 11 studies, with 2125 participants. One study was conducted in a laboratory; we disregarded the results of this study when drawing conclusions. Most studies investigated a change in one feature of the shift schedule, while some investigated changes in two features. Four studies investigated the effect of changes in direction of shift rotation, three studies speed of rotation, five studies changes in shift duration, and one study changes in the distribution of days off. Forward rotation compared to backward rotation may have no effect on sleep duration or sleep quality on rest days, but may reduce sleepiness at work. However, all of these results are very uncertain. Faster shift rotation compared to slower shift rotation may have no effect on sleep quality on rest days. Faster rotation may reduce sleep duration on rest days, but may also reduce sleepiness at work; however, the evidence for both results is very uncertain. Two studies investigated 80‐hour workweeks among doctors. They found that a schedule with shifts of no more than 16 hours, compared with a schedule with unlimited shift duration (including shifts of 24 to 28 hours), may increase sleep duration on rest days and probably results in a slight reduction in sleepiness at work. Shorter shift duration (eight or 10 hours) compared to longer shift duration (two to three hours longer) may have no effect on sleep quality or sleep duration on rest days, but the results are very uncertain. The effects of shift duration on sleepiness differed across studies. Changes in the distribution shift schedules (e.g. two days versus four days off in a row) may have no effect on sleep quality or sleep duration on rest days, but the results are very uncertain. We found no studies investigating other changes in shift schedules. Overall, there is a need for more high‐quality studies to draw firm conclusions on the effects of shift schedule changes on sleep and sleepiness. Currently, we cannot draw useful conclusions from the available evidence. Main limitations of the evidence Too few of the included studies allocated workers to the schedule change at random. In addition, many studies included few workers and lacked reliable measurements of sleep and sleepiness. How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 December 2020.",
