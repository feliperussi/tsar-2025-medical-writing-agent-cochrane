Key messages Cognitive rehabilitation helps people living with dementia to manage everyday activities that are important to them. Future studies could explore how to use cognitive rehabilitation to also improve overall functioning and wellbeing. What is dementia? Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible. What is cognitive rehabilitation? Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one‐to‐one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well. What did we want to find out? We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner ‐ usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.  What did we do?   We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. What did we find?  We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimer’s disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported). The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.  This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later. Other results Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing. There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.  There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year. Results for several effects of cognitive rehabilitation were not clear. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to October 2022.",
