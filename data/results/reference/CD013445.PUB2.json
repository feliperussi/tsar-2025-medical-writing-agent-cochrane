  "text": "Comparison of two treatment options for kidney stones\n\nWhat are kidney stones?\n\nKidney stones are collections of calcium‐containing material that are usually hard and can form in one or both kidneys. Kidney stones can form when high levels of certain minerals form crystals in the urinary tract. These stones can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pea. In rare cases they can be as big as golf balls. Small kidney stones may not cause symptoms or severe pain. Larger stones can block urine from leaving the kidney.\nHow are kidney stones treated?\n\nPeople with large kidney stones often need treatment. Two common ways to treat them are called percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). PCNL involves placing a small tube from the skin into the kidney and then using different instruments to break up and remove the stones. RIRS involves placing a long viewing tube through the urethra (the tube connecting the bladder to the outside of the body) and the ureter (the tube connecting the bladder and the kidney) into the kidney, then using different instruments to break up and remove the stones. It is unclear how the two treatments compare.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if PCNL was better than RIRS for treating kidney stones. We were mainly interested in the following results.\n• Complete removal of stones• Serious complications• Need for another procedure to remove stones• Unplanned medical visits• Length of hospital stay• Narrowing (stricture) of or injury to the ureter• Quality of life\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults with kidney stones of any size and located in any part of the kidney. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 42 studies that randomly allocated participants to either PCNL or RIRS. There were 4571 participants in total. The average age of participants was between 27.7 years and 59.3 years, and the average stone size was between 10.1 mm and 39.1 mm.\nMain results\nWe found that compared with people treated with RIRS, people treated with PCNL may be more likely to be free of stones after the procedure and less likely to need another procedure to remove remaining stones. PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious complications, although it may result in a longer hospital stay. We also found that people treated with PCNL may be no more likely to have a stricture of the ureter than people treated with RIRS. We did not find any evidence for unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for most results, mainly because the studies were not well planned or carried out and because the results varied considerably across studies.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe findings of this review are up to date to 23 March 2023.",
