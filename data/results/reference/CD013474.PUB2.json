  "text": "Is maintenance therapy following previous treatment better than observation or placebo for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in adults?\n\nWhat is the aim of this review?\n\nWe aimed to determine whether the currently available maintenance treatments for disease control in adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) have an acceptable balance between benefits and harms following previous treatment.\nKey messages\nWe found that maintenance therapy in adults with CLL after previous therapy probably has little to no effect on long‐term survival. We also found that maintenance therapy probably increases the disease control period, but is associated with an increase in drug‐related serious adverse events and all adverse events.\nWhat was studied in this review?\n\nCLL is a blood cancer that affects the lymphocytes, a group of white blood cells that help the body fight infection and disease. In the past 20 years, the control rate and survival of patients have significantly improved due to the use of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, followed by the introduction of novel oral targeted therapy as the mainstream treatment for CLL. Despite these advancements, CLL patients may still develop disease that is resistant to treatment. Maintenance treatments aim to improve treatment response and extend survival, but may also increase the risk of adverse events. Available drugs for maintenance intervention include anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), immunomodulatory drugs, and anti‐CD52 mAbs. These drugs carry risks of serious side effects due to prolonged administration. It remains unclear whether the benefits of maintenance treatments outweigh the risks, as they may not achieve a satisfactory balance between disease control and prolonged survival without increasing treatment‐related death or adverse events. CLL patients who achieve remission after the first phase of treatment must therefore weigh the benefits and risks of medical observation or maintenance therapy carefully.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if maintenance therapy following previous treatment is effective in controlling disease for adults with CLL and if it causes any adverse effects.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared maintenance therapy with placebo (dummy treatment) or observation, or head‐to‐head comparisons of maintenance therapies. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe identified 11 studies (2393 participants) for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are the most reliable clinical studies as they randomly allocate people to receive treatment (intervention group) or no treatment (control group). We synthesised the evidence from 10 studies (2341 participants) to assess the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for CLL when compared with control groups receiving observation or placebo (dummy treatment).\nCompared to observation, anti‐CD20 mAbs probably have little to no effect on overall survival (evidence from 3 studies with 1152 participants), but probably increase the time in which the disease is controlled (progression‐free survival) (evidence from 5 studies with 1255 participants).\nCompared to placebo/observation, IMiD probably has little to no effect on overall survival (evidence from 3 studies with 461 participants), but probably results in a large increase in progression‐free survival (evidence from 3 studies with 461 participants).\nCompared to observation, anti‐CD20 mAbs may result in increased serious side effects (evidence from 5 studies with 1284 participants), but may not affect the chance of dying from treatment (evidence from 4 studies with 1189 participants). Anti‐CD20 mAbs may slightly reduce the number of people who stopped treatment (evidence from 6 studies with 1321 participants), but may slightly increase the overall number of side effects (evidence from 6 studies with 1321 participants).\nCompared to placebo/observation, IMiD may result in increased serious side effects (evidence from 2 studies with 400 participants), and may slightly increase the number of people who died due to maintenance treatment (evidence from 3 studies with 458 participants). The evidence for the effect of IMiD on number of people who stopped treatment is very uncertain (evidence from 2 studies with 400 participants), but IMiD probably increases the overall number of side effects (evidence from 3 studies with 458 participants).\nThere was insufficient evidence to determine whether anti‐CD20 mAbs maintenance therapy affected health‐related quality of life, and our confidence in the evidence is low (evidence from 1 study with 480 participants).\nNo studies evaluated other new maintenance interventions, such as B‐cell receptor inhibitors, B‐cell leukaemia‐2/lymphoma‐2 inhibitors, or obinutuzumab.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe overall certainty (confidence) of the evidence was mostly moderate to low due to issues within the trials such as the potential for bias, differences in baseline characteristics, and imprecise estimates of intervention effects.\nHow up‐to‐date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is current as of January 2022.",
