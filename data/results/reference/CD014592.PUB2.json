  "text": "Does oestrogen therapy help to treat pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women?\n\nKey messages\n• Although 14 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, no studies addressed our comparisons of greatest interest, so we are uncertain about the effects of oestrogen therapy on pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\n• Further research is needed to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women.\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\n\nPelvic organ prolapse is when a woman's uterus (womb), bladder, or rectum moves down from its normal position into the vagina. It is a common condition, affecting 50% of women over 50 years old who have had at least one child. Between 6% and 12% of women who have had a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) will experience pelvic organ prolapse. Women who are older, who have had more children, and who are overweight are more likely to have pelvic organ prolapse. Women with pelvic organ prolapse may have the feeling of \"something coming down\" into the vagina, or other symptoms that can negatively affect their quality of life and body image, such as discomfort during sex or urinary problems.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nMany clinicians prescribe oestrogen therapy (a type of hormonal therapy) to treat pelvic organ prolapse, sometimes in combination with other treatments such as a pessary (a device inserted into the vagina to provide support) or surgery. However, the benefits of this approach are unclear. We wanted to find out whether using oestrogen therapy, either alone or together with other treatments, could improve the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women after their menopause.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated the effects of oestrogen therapy, either alone or in combination with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, on postmenopausal women. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the results based on aspects such as methods and number of participants.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 14 studies involving a total of 1002 women. Ten studies recruited women with different severities of pelvic organ prolapse. There were differences across studies in terms of the location of pelvic organ prolapse, the number of children the women had had, whether the women had had a hysterectomy, and the type of oestrogen therapy being investigated.\nMain results\nAlthough we identified 14 eligible studies, no studies addressed our main comparisons of interest (oestrogen therapy alone compared with no treatment, compared with pelvic floor muscle exercises, compared with surgery, or compared with devices such as vaginal pessaries). Four studies evaluated oestrogen therapy alongside vaginal pessaries compared with vaginal pessaries alone, and 10 studies evaluated oestrogen therapy alongside surgery compared with surgery alone.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain because of concerns about the studies' methods. The women were often aware of the treatments they were receiving, which may have affected the results. Additionally, many studies included few women.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 20 June 2022.",
