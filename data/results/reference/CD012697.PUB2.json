People with schizophrenia may have difficulties living a normal life due to the illness, which may include distorted beliefs despite reality, hearing voices created by their minds, and having no interest in caring for others or themselves.\nWhy is this important for people with schizophrenia?\n\nMost people with schizophrenia receive antipsychotic treatments. For those who don't respond well to antipsychotics or wish to use alternative treatments, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an effective and safe choice. This therapy causes a seizure in an anaesthetised person by electric currents applied to the brain; in this way, psychotic symptoms are improved or relieved. However, ECT has side effects such as temporary memory loss, and confusion after treatments, which limits its use. Magnetic seizure therapy is one of the novel non‐invasive brain stimulation techniques, which works like ECT by inducing a seizure, however not with electric currents but with magnetic energy fields, which theoretically would cause less risk of memory loss or confusion after the treatments.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know whether MST helps people with schizophrenia.\nWe were interested in:\n‐ number of people with symptoms improved;\n‐ number of people with impaired cognitive function;\n‐ number of people with clinically important side effects.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated the effect of MST compared to any other treatments for people with schizophrenia.\nWe compared and summarised the results of the study and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nMain results\nWe found one short‐term randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 79 adults that met the review requirements. It compared MST plus standard care to ECT plus standard care. Our findings were based on very limited data. We found that MST and ECT may be comparable in improving the global state of people with schizophrenia, and in improving the overall, positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration and may improve cognitive function compared to ECT. There may be no difference between the two groups in terms of leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy. We cannot conclude whether MST is helpful or safe for people with schizophrenia based on limited data. Well‐designed RCTs are warranted to answer the question.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to 06 March 2022.",
