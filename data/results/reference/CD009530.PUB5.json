  "text": "Using samples obtained by bronchoscopy to decide how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis\n\nKey messages\nWe found evidence from two small studies that only included children.\nWe do not know the best way to get samples that guide which antibiotics should be prescribed for a lung infection.\nWhat is the background to the review?\n\nCF is a genetic condition that causes damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs. Breathing problems in people with CF are mainly due to repeated lung infections. Growing bugs from samples of mucus coughed up from the lower airways can allow doctors to quickly identify the bug causing the infection and start treatment early. If people can not cough up mucus, swabs are taken from the upper throat to identify the bug causing infection in the lower airways, but this may not be the most reliable method.\nDuring a bronchoscopy, doctors examine the lower airways using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and camera at one end; they may also collect mucus. The patient needs to be sedated or put under general anaesthetic. We do not know if treatment based on samples taken during a bronchoscopy is better than treatment based on throat swabs.\nThis review updates a review first published in 2013.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether to use samples obtained by bronchoscopy when deciding how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies involving people of any age with CF. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included two studies in this review, which involved 186 children. One study recruited 170 babies under the age of six months who were diagnosed with CF and monitored them for up to five years. The second study included 30 children with CF between the ages of five and 18 years and monitored them for up to two years. In both studies, the participants were divided into two groups completely at random, with one group given antibiotics based on samples taken via bronchoscopy and the other group given antibiotics based on samples taken from the throat. In the larger study, children had a bronchoscopy when they showed features of worsening chest symptoms, whereas children in the smaller study had a bronchoscopy when they showed an increase in the Lung Clearance Index, which is a marker of early lung disease that measures how well the air moves within the lungs.\nMain results\nNeither study showed any difference between the groups in terms of lung function, weight, body mass index or in the score calculated by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs when measured at either two or five years. The longer study also showed that there was no difference in how many children in each group had an infection withPseudomonasaeruginosaat five years of age, or per year of follow‐up, or how often a child was unwell with respiratory symptoms. In this longer study, children in the bronchoscopy group were admitted to hospital more often, although admissions were generally shorter than in the comparison group. There was no difference between the groups in the overall cost of care and health‐related quality of life scores.\nSide effects reported during and after bronchoscopy were not serious; the most common side effect was increased coughing (in one third of children).\nThere is currently not enough evidence to support the regular use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and treat lung infections in children with CF.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nEvidence was limited to two studies. While these studies were well designed, we could not combine their results because they used different methods of measurement. We have low confidence in the reliability of the evidence for most outcomes, and moderate confidence in the results for two outcomes (high‐resolution computed tomography scoring and cost‐of‐care analysis). We cannot be sure about the results because of the small number of children included. Also, the studies only included young children, so we do not know if the results would be the same in adults with CF. Since the treatment of a first infection withPseudomonas aeruginosais highly successful, larger and longer studies are needed to detect small differences between the groups. Conducting such large studies is extremely difficult and more sensitive measures should be used.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nWe last searched for evidence in November 2023.",
