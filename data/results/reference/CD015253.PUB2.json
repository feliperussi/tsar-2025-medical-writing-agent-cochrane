  "text": "Autoinflation for otitis media with effusion (OME or 'glue ear') in children\n\nKey messages\nDue to a lack of robust evidence, we are uncertain whether autoinflation has any effect on hearing. Using autoinflation two to three times per day may slightly reduce the number of children with OME after three months follow‐up. Scores on a questionnaire that looked at quality of life for people with OME were also better for children who carried out autoinflation. However, some children may experience pain when using autoinflation.\nWhat is OME?\n\nOtitis media with effusion (OME, sometimes called 'glue ear') is a common condition affecting young children. Fluid collects in the middle ear, causing hearing impairment. As a result of their poor hearing, children may have behavioural difficulties and delays in their speech development.\nHow is OME treated?\n\nMost of the time, OME does not need any treatment and the symptoms will get better with time. In children with persistent OME, different treatments have been explored, including medications or surgery. Autoinflation is a technique where children blow air out of their nose against a pressure device (such as a balloon). This forces air back through the Eustachian tube, which connects the back of the nose to the middle ear. Opening of this tube may allow the middle ear fluid to drain away.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to identify whether autoinflation was better than no treatment, medical treatment or surgical treatment for children with OME.\nWe also wanted to see if there were any unwanted effects associated with autoinflation.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with OME. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with OME. Most of the studies were in children aged over three years old, and only lasted for up to three months. They compared autoinflation (carried out two to three times per day) with no treatment.\nWe are uncertain whether autoinflation has any effect on hearing, as there was very little evidence about this.\nAutoinflation may slightly reduce the number of children who still have OME after three months of follow‐up, and may result in an improvement in quality of life.\nChildren who use autoinflation may experience more ear pain than those who do not receive any treatment, but only one study assessed this, and the number of children with pain was small (4.4% compared to 1.3% in those who did not have treatment).\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little information about the longer‐term effects of autoinflation. A variety of different techniques and devices are available for autoinflation, and we do not know if some of these are more effective than others.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to January 2023.",
