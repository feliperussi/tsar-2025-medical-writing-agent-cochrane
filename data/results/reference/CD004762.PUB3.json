  "text": "What medicines are useful to treat myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation after contraction)?\n\nKey messages\n– Mexiletine appears to be safe and is likely an effective treatment for managing symptoms of myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation after a contraction) in people with non‐dystrophic myotonia and it probably also slightly reduces myotonia in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n– Lamotrigine may also reduce myotonia in non‐dystrophic myotonia.\n– More research and larger studies are needed to determine with certainty if lamotrigine is an effective treatment in both myotonic dystrophy and non‐dystrophic myotonia.\nWhat is myotonia?\n\nMyotonia is delayed relaxation of muscles after they have contracted. It is a key symptom in a number of muscle diseases called myotonic disorders. These are genetic conditions that have a significant impact on quality of life and function, and include the conditions non‐dystrophic myotonia (where there is no muscle wastage) and myotonic dystrophy (where there is muscle wastage).\nMyotonia can affect skeletal muscles (muscles that are attached to bones by tendons and are responsible for movement; for example, hands, legs, and face) and is experienced as stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. There is currently no cure for myotonia but the symptoms can be treated with medicines called acetazolamide, phenytoin, mexiletine, lamotrigine, clomipramine, imipramine, and taurine (among others).\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nThis review looked at studies which tested the effectiveness of different medicines for treating myotonia.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for well‐designed studies that looked at treatments for myotonia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 17 studies involving 392 people, of whom 219 had myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 had non‐dystrophic myotonia. Seven studies were newly identified and included in this updated review, with 249 people (106 with myotonic dystrophy and 143 with non‐dystrophic myotonia). Four of these studies looked exclusively at people with non‐dystrophic myotonia and the effects of mexiletine or lamotrigine. Other studies explored mexiletine in people with myotonic dystrophy.\nBased on these studies, mexiletine appears to be safe and is likely an effective treatment for the symptoms of myotonia in people with non‐dystrophic myotonia. In myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably reduces myotonia slightly. Lamotrigine may reduce myotonia in people with non‐dystrophic myotonia.\nIn general, both medicines were well tolerated. The most common unwanted effects of mexiletine were heartburn/reflux (a burning feeling in the chest that is caused by stomach acid coming up into your throat) and headache. The unwanted effects of lamotrigine included headache, skin rash and itching, and fatigue. These more‐recent studies were better designed and conducted.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nSome of the included studies had sections that were not described well, and made the evidence less reliable. Studies of medicines other than mexiletine or lamotrigine were small or not well described. Our confidence in these medications was limited because the results varied widely between studies, and they involved only small numbers of people. Some studies did not clearly report how they were conducted and used methods that were likely to introduce errors in their results.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current up to March 2023.",
