  "text": "Do dressings and securement devices prevent complications for people with peripheral arterial catheters?\n\nKey messages\n– We are very uncertain whether different dressings and securement devices reduce the risk of peripheral arterial catheter complications or failure.\n– We found five studies that investigated this, but we are not very confident in their results due to small sample sizes and few outcome events.\n– Future research should compare products currently used to secure and dress arterial catheters in hospitals, with high‐quality methods and large numbers of people receiving catheters.\n– It is important for patients and caregivers to discuss the risks and benefits of different arterial catheter dressing and securement devices with their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can help the patient choose the best device for their individual needs.\nWhat are peripheral arterial catheters?\n\nPeripheral arterial catheters are thin tubes that are inserted into a patient's arteries through their skin. They are generally used in intensive and critical care settings or in operating theatres to monitor blood pressure or when a patient's blood needs to be regularly sampled. These patients may be critically unwell and require the catheter to support care.\nDespite their importance, arterial catheters often fail (stop working) and need to be reinserted. There are many different dressings and securement devices that aim to keep arterial catheters in place and fully functioning. It is not clear which dressings or securement devices are the most effective for maintaining arterial catheter function and preventing arterial catheter complications.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out which dressings or securement devices were the most effective for preventing arterial catheters from stopping working due to infection and complications including dislodgement, occlusion (blockages), and unwanted effects in hospitalised people.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for well‐designed studies that compared different types of dressings and securement devices for arterial catheters. We then compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found five studies that involved 1228 people with 1228 arterial catheters. The studies compared different dressing and securement devices and included the following four comparisons.\n1. Standard polyurethane plus tissue adhesive versus standard polyurethane (clear (transparent) dressing with medical grade 'super glue' versus clear dressing)\n2. Bordered polyurethane versus standard polyurethane (bordered dressing versus clear dressing)\n3. Standard polyurethane plus sutureless securement devices versus standard polyurethane (clear dressing with skin anchor device versus clear dressing)\n4. Integrated securement dressings versus standard polyurethane (bordered dressing with additional securement dressing versus clear dressing)\nMain results\nWe are uncertain whether use of the following dressing and securement products reduces the risk of arterial catheter failure or catheter‐related bloodstream infection: standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, tissue adhesive, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\nWe are also uncertain if using the above dressings and securement products reduces the risk of arterial catheter dislodgement, blockages, or adverse (unwanted) events; or if these products lead to improved patient satisfaction.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not very confident in the current available evidence because of the low number of participants included and few events in these studies. Due to the nature of the intervention, participants and investigators were aware of which treatment participants received. This could have had an effect on the way that participants who received different interventions were treated. Further trials could examine the effect of dressing and securement products in more defined populations, including children and newborn babies. In addition, a standardised set of outcomes would support researchers to measure the same outcomes, across similar measurement points to help data collection. The evidence in this field is evolving and future research may help address unanswered clinical questions.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 16 May 2023.",
