  "text": "Do education programmes improve outcomes in people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes? Key messages • For people with both chronic kidney disease (a long‐term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high), education programmes (planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition) may improve their knowledge of diabetes, their ability to manage their condition, and self‐management behavioural changes. • However, the small number of people enrolled in these studies and the wide range of outcomes reported means our findings must be interpreted cautiously. Larger, well‐designed studies with common outcomes and longer follow‐ups are needed. Why is improving diabetes care important for people with kidney disease? Chronic kidney disease (a long‐term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively) and diabetes (a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high) are chronic conditions that bring on many challenges for people, particularly when they have to manage both at the same time. Diabetes can accelerate the development of kidney disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure (a condition where the kidneys no longer function well enough to keep a person alive). While sticking to complex treatment plans can be challenging, successful self‐management in the early stages of kidney disease can improve outcomes later in life and delay the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. What are education programmes? Education programmes are any set of planned activities designed to improve a person's ability to manage their condition and delay the progression of their kidney disease. These activities can aim to improve a person's knowledge of their disease, self‐care activities, and their ability to self‐monitor the disease, thus encouraging and motivating them to create healthy lifestyle changes, improve their treatment compliance, and improve quality of life. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out whether an education programme designed for people with both kidney disease and diabetes helps them understand their condition and recognise the importance of strategies aimed at slowing its progression and preventing long‐term complications. What did we do? We searched for randomised studies (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups) that compared education programmes to usual care for people with both kidney disease and diabetes. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included eight studies involving 840 people 18 years or older with both kidney disease and diabetes. Four studies were undertaken in multiple centres, and four studies were performed in single centres. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 12 weeks to four years. Most of the education programmes were designed to increase a person's knowledge of their condition and improve self‐management behaviours. One study focused on reducing stress using mindfulness (a person's ability to be aware of where they are and what they are doing), and it was adapted to include practices for complex thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, and one study used a co‐ordinated medical care approach with multiple practitioners involved in a person's care. Overall, education programmes probably lower blood glucose levels and may lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, but may make little or no difference to kidney function, abnormally low or high blood sugar, and cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). For people with diabetes on dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly), an education programme may improve their knowledge of diabetes, self‐management behaviour for checking their feet, using lotion, wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and coping with stress. For people with moderately increased protein in the urine, there may be an improvement in their general knowledge of diabetes, their confidence in monitoring their blood sugar levels at home, their beliefs in their personal control, as well as behavioural changes to their diet. There may be no behavioural changes to exercise, foot care, or quitting smoking. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have low confidence in education programmes improving the understanding of diabetes in people with kidney disease. This is because the number of studies reporting outcomes of interest was low, and the education programmes varied, so we were unable to properly analyse the results. How up‐to‐date is the evidence? The evidence is current to July 2024.",
