  "text": "Can endoscopic sinus surgery (i.e. surgery using a long thin tube inserted into the sinuses) help to treat nasal polyposis (soft growths in the nasal passages called polyps) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)?\n\nKey messages\nWe are uncertain whether nasal irrigation together with an endoscopic sinus surgery intervention improves symptoms and lung function or reduces the need for antibiotics compared to nasal irrigation alone.\nThere was one episode of bleeding during surgery that was corrected during the procedure with no further consequences.\nWhat is CF?\n\nCF is a genetic condition that affects the lungs, nose, sinuses and several other organs in the body. The body produces thick sticky mucus that is hard to clear and causes inflammation. Many adults and children with CF have polyps in their nasal passages and sinuses as a result of this sticky mucus and the inflammation. Polyps can lead to more lung infections and a worse quality of life.\nHow are nasal polyps in CF treated?\n\nEndoscopic sinus surgery aims to open the blocked sinuses to improve breathing and make it easier to clear mucus. It is a procedure with a few side effects (bleeding and damage to the sinuses) linked to it.\nMedical treatment includes a number of medicines (both inhaled and swallowed), such as antibiotics, steroids and inhaled medications with humidified oxygen. Saline solutions are also used for nasal blockages. A new group of drugs is available, called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators; these drugs are able to correct the basic defect in the CFTR protein, but it is not yet clear how they may affect nasal polyps.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nIs endoscopic sinus surgery alone or used together with medical treatment better than medical treatment alone for improving quality of life and lung function without complications in people with CF? We also wanted to know the effects of treatment on bacterial infections, pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of lung disease), need for additional antibiotics and survival.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe looked for studies that compared the different treatments in people who had been diagnosed with CF, polyps and chronic sinus problems. Participants had to have been put into treatment groups in a random order.\nWhat did we find?\n\nMain results\nWe found a single study which compared nasal irrigation (with saline solution and mometasone (which is a steroid)) in 14 young adults to nasal irrigation with endoscopic sinus surgery in another 14 young adults. The 28 people taking part in the study were aged 19 to 28 years. Those who had surgery as well as using saline irrigation reported a greater improvement in nasal symptoms. They also had a greater reduction in the number of bacteria in their nasal passages, used fewer antibiotics and had fewer pulmonary exacerbations, but there was no difference in their lung function. One person bled more than usual during surgery, but that was successfully dealt with during the procedure with no further consequences. The study did not report on survival.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur overall confidence in the evidence was very low because we could not determine how participants were put into the different treatment groups and whether the investigators would know into which group a person would be put. Participants and researchers were not blinded and that could bias some outcomes, including changes in quality of life. Another reason for our low confidence in the evidence is that we found only one study which included a very small number of participants.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to 4 July 2022.",
