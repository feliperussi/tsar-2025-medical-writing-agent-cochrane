Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) is a frequent complaint of people with myotonic dystrophy and is related to problems with controlling breathing.\nHow can hypersomnia in myotonic dystrophy be treated?\n\nPsychostimulants are medicines that increase alertness and include caffeine, amphetamine, selegiline, methylphenidate, and modafinil.\nWhat did we want to find?\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychostimulants are better than placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment in treating hypersomnia in myotonic dystrophy.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at psychostimulants compared with placebo or no treatment in children and adults with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found six studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of psychostimulants in myotonic dystrophy. The effects of psychostimulants on hypersomnia as evaluated by objective sleep studies and on quality of life are very uncertain. Psychostimulants may improve hypersomnia as self‐evaluated by patients and may increase the risk of unwanted effects. Further studies looking at the effectiveness and safety of psychostimulants for myotonic dystrophy are needed.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe included studies involved between 11 and 40 people, and only adults. No study evaluated treatment beyond four weeks.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to January 2023.",
