It is found in liver, eggs, dairy products, and most green leafy or orange fruit and vegetables. However, lack of vitamin A (vitamin A deficiency) is a common public health problem, especially in low‐income countries. People with vitamin A deficiency may suffer from poor growth, an unhealthy immune system, night blindness and blindness. They are more likely to catch infectious diseases. Young children and pregnant women are most at risk.\nIn order to decide whether treatment with vitamin A supplements is needed or not, for individuals and communities, we need to know the existing levels of vitamin A deficiency. This requires accurate tests. Not recognising vitamin A deficiency when it is present may result in delayed or no vitamin A supplementation; vitamin A deficiency worsens, leading to scarring and vision problems. An incorrect diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency may mean that individuals are given vitamin A supplements when they are not needed, increasing the risk of vitamin A intake above recommended levels.\nWhat tests measure vitamin A status?\n\nThe most accurate tests for vitamin A status (called the 'reference standards’) are liver biopsy and retinol isotope dilution. Liver biopsy involves removing a small sample of someone's liver and examining it under a microscope in a laboratory. Retinol isotope dilution involves giving a small dose of vitamin A and then examining a blood sample. These tests are invasive, costly, time‐consuming, and technically demanding.\nOther tests to measure a person’s vitamin A status are less invasive, less expensive, and quicker, but may not be so accurate. They are called 'index tests'. They look for signs of vitamin A ('biomarkers') in a blood sample. The most common tests are 'serum or plasma retinol' (SR) and 'serum or plasma retinol binding protein' (RBP). A positive test result indicates vitamin A deficiency, while a negative test result indicates the absence of vitamin A deficiency.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to determine the accuracy of index tests compared with the reference standards for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people at risk of vitamin A deficiency.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated the accuracy of the index tests compared to a reference standard and combined the results of the studies.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 40 studies that compared at least one index test and one reference test. Studies took place in North, Central and South America; Europe; South and Southeast Asia; and Africa. Participants were aged from 1 month to over 80 years. The percentage of people with vitamin A deficiency averaged between 4% and 60%. The results below are based on a hypothetical group of 1000 people.\nSR versus retinol isotope dilution (23 studies)\nIn1000peoplewhere100 (10%)have vitamin A deficiency measured withretinol isotope dilution,82people would have a SR result indicating vitamin A deficiency is present. Of these,72would be incorrectly classified as having vitamin A deficiency. Of the918 peoplewith a result indicating that vitamin A deficiency is not present,90would be incorrectly classified as not having vitamin A deficiency.\nSR versus liver vitamin A (16 studies)\nIn1000peoplewhere100 (10%)have vitamin A deficiency measured withliver vitamin A,206 peoplewould have a SR result indicating vitamin A deficiency is present. Of these,153would be incorrectly classified as having vitamin A deficiency. Of the794 peoplewith a result indicating that vitamin A deficiency is not present,47would be incorrectly classified as not having vitamin A deficiency.\nRBP versus retinol isotope dilution (8 studies)\nIn1000peoplewhere100 (10%)have vitamin A deficiency measured withretinol isotope dilution,266 peoplewould have a RBP result indicating vitamin A deficiency is present. Of these,216would be incorrectly classified as having vitamin A deficiency. Of the734 peoplewith a result indicating that vitamin A deficiency is not present,50would be incorrectly classified as not having vitamin A deficiency.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. Most studies were small with little information about how they were done, so we couldn't judge how robust their methods were. Studies were not designed to determine the accuracy of index tests, so we need to be careful about interpreting their results. Finally, we didn't find information on all the tests.\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2022.",
