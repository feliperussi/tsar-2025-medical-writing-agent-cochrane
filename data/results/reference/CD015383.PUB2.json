  "text": "Psychedelic‐assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression and existential distress in people with life‐threatening diseases\n\nKey messages\n‐ In people with life‐threatening diseases (e.g. cancer), we found that psychedelic‐assisted therapy with “classical” psychedelics (i.e. psilocybin ('magic mushrooms'), LSD), may result in a reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms.\n‐ We also found that existential distress (such as feeling that life has no meaning) and quality of life may be improved by classical psychedelics, but the evidence is mixed and very uncertain.\n‐ Data regarding these outcomes is minimal for psychedelic‐assisted therapy with MDMA ('Ecstasy'), and we are very uncertain about the results.\n‐ No severe negative side effects of psychedelic‐assisted therapy were reported in the studies we identified, but the evidence is very uncertain. Moderate side effects subsided after the drug effects wore off or within the following week.\nWhat is the significance of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‐threatening diseases?\n\nAnxiety, depression and existential distress are frequently experienced by people facing a life‐threatening disease and negatively impact their quality of life as well as the quality of life of their caregivers.\nHow are anxiety, depression, and existential distress treated?\n\nTreatment of these symptoms is challenging, especially in end‐of‐life care, because well‐established antidepressant or anti‐anxiety medication may not work and psychotherapy may take a long time or be difficult to access.\nWhat is psychedelic‐assisted therapy?\n\nPsychedelics are illegal in most countries, but a few places have allowed restricted access, and research into the potential use of these drugs is increasing. Psychedelic‐assisted therapy involves the intake of a psychedelic drug (e.g. LSD, psilocybin ('magic mushrooms'), MDMA ('Ecstasy')) under close supervision by a therapist (physicians, psychologists, and others). Psychedelic‐assisted therapy includes three treatment phases: preparation sessions take place first, then the drug dosing (intake) session, and afterwards, integration sessions are conducted to reflect on the experience.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether psychedelic‐assisted therapy was better than active‐placebo‐assisted therapy to improve anxiety, depression, and existential distress. We also wanted to find out whether psychedelic‐assisted therapy was linked with any unwanted effects or risk of harm.\nWhat did we do?Our aim was to systematically collect and evaluate available evidence for psychedelic‐assisted therapy to treat anxiety, depression, and existential distress. We searched for high quality clinical studies. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found six studies testing psychedelic‐assisted therapy using psilocybin (3 studies), LSD (2 studies), and MDMA (1 study). The studies involved 149 adults with anxiety, depression, or existential distress. The largest study tested psilocybin in 56 people and the two smallest studies tested psilocybin or LSD in 12 people. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland. Most studies had a follow‐up of 6 to 12 months. Drug companies were not involved in study funding, but funding was provided by organisations that promote psychedelic‐assisted therapy.\nPsychedelic‐assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) compared to an active placebo (e.g. a very low dose of the same drug) may reduce anxiety and depression. However, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; we may find that the true effect is substantially different when more studies are conducted. Psychedelic‐assisted therapy with classical psychedelics may reduce existential distress, but the evidence is mixed and very uncertain. For psychedelic‐assisted therapy with MDMA, the data on anxiety or depression is inconclusive, and existential distress was not investigated.\nPsychedelic‐assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) compared to an active placebo may improve quality of life and induce spiritually significant experiences, but the evidence is very uncertain. For MDMA‐assisted therapy, quality of life did not improve, but the evidence is very uncertain. Spirituality outcomes were not assessed for MDMA.\nPsychedelic‐assisted therapy seems to be well tolerated, but evidence about side effects is very uncertain. The studies reported no serious side effects. The classical psychedelic studies reported mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, anxiety, dry mouth, psychotic‐like symptoms (e.g. pseudo‐hallucination, where people know that they are hallucinating), and high blood pressure, which subsided when the drug effects wore off or the following day. The MDMA study reported anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches, which subsided when the drug effects wore off or within the following week.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThere were several limitations to the evidence. Importantly, participants were often aware of the treatment they were receiving, which may influence their results. In addition, the studies were small. It is important to note that future studies might change the conclusions of this review. As the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) currently classifies psychedelics as Schedule I substances (i.e. having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse), research involving these drugs is restricted, but is steadily increasing.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review is based on a search for evidence up to March 2024.",
