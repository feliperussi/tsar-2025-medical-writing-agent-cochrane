  "text": "Sucrose for analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants undergoing heel lance\n\nKey messages\n‐ Sucrose, compared to control interventions, probably reduces pain for a single painful event (heel lance).\n‐ There were a few minor immediate adverse events, such as gagging, that resolved without intervention.\n‐ We need studies that assess the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long‐term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.\n‐ We need to assess how sucrose affects neonates who are extremely preterm, unstable, or ventilated (or a combination of these factors).\nWhat is sucrose analgesia?\n\nSucrose (table sugar) is mixed with water in various concentrations (usually 24%) and is given to babies in very small amounts (e.g. a few drops) about two minutes before a painful procedure. Sucrose is also given with other nondrug pain‐relieving interventions such as a pacifier (non‐nutritive sucking ‐ NNS) or when the baby is receiving skin‐to‐skin care.\nWhy is this important for newborn babies who are undergoing heel lance procedures?\n\nBabies who are sick or immature, and require a stay in hospital, have several painful procedures per day and multiple painful procedures throughout the hospital stay; for most babies, the majority of painful procedures are heel lances. If untreated, pain has immediate and long‐term consequences that can impact their brain and behavioural development. It is important to minimise the number of painful procedures and the associated pain and suffering.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know how well sucrose worked to relieve pain in newborn babies who are having heel lance procedures while they were in hospital. We also wanted to know whether there were any safety concerns about using sucrose to relieve pain from single painful events such as heel lance.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated:\n‐ Sucrose compared to no treatment or standard care;\n‐ Sucrose compared to water, other sweet solutions (e.g. glucose);\n‐ Sucrose compared to another nondrug intervention (e.g. NNS);\n‐ Whether sucrose was effective in decreasing the amount and severity of pain that babies experienced as assessed by baby’s pain responses (e.g. crying, grimacing, heart rate) and by using standardised infant pain scales.\nWe also wanted to know if sucrose was associated with any unwanted effects in preterm or term babies.\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods.\nWhat did we find out?\n\nWe reviewed 55 studies that included a total of 6273 babies. Twenty‐nine studies had full‐term babies only, 22 had preterm babies only, and four had both full‐term and preterm babies. Heel lance was the painful procedure in 50 studies. Five studies investigated a variety of other minor painful procedures in addition to heel lancing.\nMain results\n‐ Sucrose compared to the control treatment probably reduces pain from single heel lances in babies.\n‐ Results are uncertain about the effect of sucrose compared to NNS, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, and facilitated tucking, in reducing pain scores.\n‐ Results are uncertain about the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS, in reducing pain.\n‐ Sucrose does not seem to reduce pain from single heel lances compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin‐to‐skin care.\n‐ Reported adverse events were minor and resolved without any intervention.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have moderate‐certainty evidence that sucrose likely reduces pain from heel lance.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is up‐to‐date as of February 2022.\nStudy funding sources\nWe did not identify any studies that received funding from industry.",
