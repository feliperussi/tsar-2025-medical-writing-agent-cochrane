People with asthma have inflammation (swelling) in the airways in the lungs. The symptoms are wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough.\nWhat is asthma education?\n\nAsthma education aims to teach children and caregivers how to manage their asthma using a partnership between the patient and healthcare professionals. Components of asthma education include information about asthma; training in managing asthma, including how to use inhalers effectively; a management strategy; and encouragement to use medications correctly. Monitoring of asthma, such as with a peak flow meter (a hand‐held device that measures how quickly you can breathe out fully) and regular healthcare professional reviews are also components of asthma education.\nWhy do we think the home might be a good place to give children asthma education?\n\nThe home setting allows educators to reach populations (such as those with poorer backgrounds) that may experience barriers to care (such as lack of transportation) within a familiar environment, and prevents a need for attendance at healthcare settings.\nThis review update is timely because following the COVID‐19 pandemic, healthcare policymakers are thinking more broadly about how and where care is delivered.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWhile guidelines recommend that children with asthma should receive asthma education, it is not known if education delivered in the home is superior to usual care (no education or education delivered elsewhere). We wanted to consider if the intensity of the education (e.g. how many education sessions were given) had any impact on children with asthma.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies delivering home‐based education about asthma to children or their caregivers. The education had to be compared to control (either no education or education delivered at a healthcare centre), or to a less‐intensive education delivered at home.\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 26 studies involving 5122 children. Most studies were done in North America. Most families were from poorer areas. Children differed in terms of age, severity of asthma and type of educational intervention.\nResults\nWe found that home‐based education may result in little to no difference in exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, but the evidence is very uncertain. We found that there may be little or no difference in the number of courses of oral corticosteroids prescribed (a medicine used to treat asthma that reduces inflammation (swelling) in the airways).\nWe found there may be some improvement in quality of life with home‐based education compared to control, and reduced admissions to hospital with an asthma exacerbation compared to less‐intensive education, but the evidence is uncertain.\nAsthma symptom‐free days and days missed from school or work also showed considerable uncertainty when compared with either control or less‐intensive education, and there may be little or no difference in these outcomes.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe children and families may have known which treatment they received.\nThere were many differences between the children's asthma severity, the types of education delivered and other factors. There were also many differences between the control groups of the included studies (that is, who the education group was compared to). This makes it difficult to know whether treatments had any impact on children with asthma because the studies were so different.\nThe aims of a treatment might be different too. For some children whose families have little asthma knowledge, the aim may have been to improve their knowledge of symptoms. This may encourage them to go to the emergency department more often. However, for some children who have poorly controlled asthma and may be going to the emergency department a lot, the aim may have been to decrease the number of emergency department visits. This might be by teaching them how to use their medications properly so they have improved asthma control. This makes thinking about the evidence more complicated.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis is the first update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011. The information is current to October 2022.",
