  "text": "What are the benefits and risks of using topical insect repellents to prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n• Topical repellents may slightly reduce the incidence and prevalence of malaria caused byPlasmodium falciparum.\n• These changes seem to be particularly important in high‐risk populations, specifically in refugees living in camps where there are fewer other options.\n• Topical repellents may make little or no difference in malaria prevalence and incidence in settings where insecticide‐treated nets, and other options to control the transmission of malaria are readily available.\nWhat is malaria?\n\nMalaria is a disease caused by at least five species of parasites from the genusPlasmodium, and spread by the bite ofAnophelesmosquitoes.The disease regularly affects people in tropical areas of Central and South America, South and Southeast Asia, and particularly, Africa. Over 247 million malaria cases and 619,000 deaths occurred in 2021, mostly in Africa. The disease affects the function of red blood cells, which transport oxygen through the body. This generally causes fever, malaise (a feeling of 'just not feeling well'), and other mild symptoms. However, some people can develop complicated disease, which is associated with a severe reduction in the number of circulating red blood cells, and problems in the liver, brain, and other organs.\nMalaria can be treated with different medicines, which are generally effective. Certain tools that prevent mosquito bites, like nets treated with insecticides, can protect people from getting it, and have helped to significantly reduce the number of cases around the world. Nonetheless, most of these approaches target mosquitoes that feed indoors and on humans. They are less effective against species that can feed outdoors, so do not really eliminate the disease.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if topical insect repellents (substances applied to the skin to prevent mosquito bites) can prevent malaria in people living in regions where this disease occurs regularly. We were particularly interested in their effect on people who might not be adequately protected by other measures, which are more commonly used to prevent malaria.\nWe wanted to find out if topical repellents were better than a placebo, or no intervention at all, to reduce two indicators of malaria transmission:\n• Malaria incidence (the number of new cases in a period of time);\n• Malaria prevalence (the number of all cases at a certain moment).\nWe also wanted to know if topical repellents caused any adverse side effects to people who used them.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched the existing literature for studies that compared the effect of topical repellents (alone or in combination with other tools to prevent mosquito bites) with a placebo or no intervention. We compared and summarized the results of the included studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence they provided, based on the methods used in each one.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included a total of eight studies, which included over 60,000 people. The studies took place in areas with low malaria transmission, mostly in Southeast Asia and South America.\nThe topical repellents evaluated included lotions, soaps, and cosmetics. We found evidence suggesting that topical repellents may slightly reduce the incidence and prevalence of malaria cases caused byP falciparumin settings where other tools to prevent mosquito bites are not available. Despite this, our findings suggest that repellents probably make little or no difference in places where these tools are already widely used. Topical repellents are considered safe, and the prevalence of adverse side effects was very low.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe benefits of topical repellents were particularly clear among refugees. However, shortfalls in the design of the included studies did not allow us to generalize these observations to other contexts. We only included cases of malaria caused by the parasiteP falciparum.We also recognize that studies measured and reported adherence differently, and often did not know if the participants actually used the repellent as advised.\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 11 January 2023.",
