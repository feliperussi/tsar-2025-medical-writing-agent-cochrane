  "text": "Is face‐down positioning better than other positioning after vitrectomy and gas tamponade for macula‐involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments?\n\nKey messages\n‐ There is not enough high‐quality information to say whether face‐down positioning should be recommended to people after surgery for retinal detachments affecting the center of the retina (the macula).\n‐ Overall, evidence from studies suggests that face‐down positioning after surgery may lead to fewer complications, with less postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia (double vision with both eyes open). These complications can be very bothersome to those affected, but their impact on quality of life was not studied.\n‐ Face‐down positioning may increase intraocular pressure (fluid pressure inside the eye) compared with support‐the‐break positioning (head positioning dependent on the location of retinal breaks [holes or tears in the retina]); however, intraocular pressure can most often be treated successfully.\nWhat is a macula‐involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?\n\nThe retina is a layer at the back of the eye which provides sight. It is normally attached to the wall of the eye. When it separates from the wall of the eye, then this is called a retinal detachment. When a retinal detachment is caused by a tear or break in the retina, then it is termed a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The macula is the center of the retina. If the macula also detaches, then this is called a macula‐involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.\nThe visual cells (the cells in the retina that provide sight) get their nourishment through blood vessels in the wall of the eye. If the retina is detached and away from the wall of the eye, then the visual cells do not receive nourishment. As a result, sight is lost.\nRetinal detachments are treated with surgery, often with a type of surgery called a vitrectomy. In vitrectomy surgery, the gel that fills the middle of the eye (called vitreous) is removed, and most often gas is put inside the eye to push the retina back in place (gas tamponade). The gas rises, like a balloon. Some surgeons ask their patients to keep their head down (face‐down positioning) right after surgery so that the gas pushes the macula flat into its normal position.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if keeping the face‐down position after vitrectomy and gas tamponade for macula‐involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is better than keeping the head in other positions. Keeping the head face‐down may prevent such complications as large or small folds forming in the macula. These folds can affect sight. We also wanted to find out if face‐down positioning has any harmful effects, such as neck problems.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared keeping the head face‐down after surgery with other head positions in people with macula‐involving retinal detachments. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found three studies with a total of 368 people (369 eyes) with macula‐involving retinal detachments. Study follow‐up time varied, with the longest being six months. The results showed that some complications may be less frequent with face‐down positioning, including retinal displacement (the retina 'landing' in a different position than where it was before it detached), retinal folds, and double vision. These complications may be very troublesome for people. Face‐down positioning may increase the chance of high pressure in the eye; however, this can most often be successfully treated with eye drops. Face‐down positioning did not seem to make any difference in the quantity of vision (reading letters in the chart) or quality of vision (how clearly people saw), or in quality of life.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very low confidence in the evidence for face‐down positioning after vitrectomy and gas tamponade for macula‐involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment because of the relatively small sample sizes and flawed study designs.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to November 2022.",
