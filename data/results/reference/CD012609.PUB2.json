  "text": "Infliximab for the maintenance of successful treatment in Crohn's Disease\n\nKey messages\nInfliximab is probably superior to placebo for preventing disease relapse for patients who have shown response to infliximab. It may also be superior to placebo for preventing loss of response in patients with fistulating disease. It may be similar to placebo in terms of total adverse events.\nInfliximab combined with purine analogues is probably superior to purine analogues alone for preventing disease relapse, both clinically and endoscopically, for patients in remission, who have shown response to infliximab.\nInfliximab may be similar to the biosimilar for preventing clinical relapse, and it may be slightly worse in preventing loss of clinical response, for patients with active disease who have shown response to infliximab. Infliximab may be worse than the biosimilar in terms of withdrawals due to adverse events. Infliximab may be similar to the biosimilar for serious and total adverse events.\nWhat is Crohn's Disease?\n\nCrohn's disease is a chronic (life‐long) inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the gut. Common symptoms include bloody poo, diarrhoea, stomach ache, fever, weight loss, fatigue, and others. When someone is experiencing symptoms of Crohn's, they are said to have 'active' disease and, when their symptoms are under control, they are considered 'in remission'. We don't know what exactly causes Crohn's, but it could be related to a combination of the genes, immune system malfunction, 'bad' gut bacteria, and environmental reasons. There is no known cure, but the symptoms are usually managed with drugs, such as steroids, immune system medications and, if necessary, surgery. At the turn of the century, a new type of drug called infliximab, which belongs to a drug category called biologics, became available and started being widely used for the treatment of Crohn's.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how infliximab compares to any other medical treatment, or dummy treatment (placebo), for maintaining remission or treatment response in Crohn's. We also wanted to find out how safe it is compared to other treatments.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups, and can give us the highest standard of evidence) comparing infliximab with any other medical treatment for people with Crohn's Disease. We only included studies with adult patients. We had no restrictions in terms of sex, disease duration or previous medications used.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found nine studies with 1257 participants that met our inclusion criteria.\nInfliximab was compared to placebo, purine analogues (azathioprine and/or 6‐mercaptopurine), a biosimilar (a drug designed to be very similar to infliximab), and a different biologic drug called adalimumab. Infliximab was also combined with purine analogues and compared to purine analogues alone, and two different forms of the biosimilar were compared to each other.\nThree studies had participants who were in remission at the beginning of the study, while the other six had participants with various degrees of active disease who had responded to previous treatment with infliximab at the beginning of the study.\nInfliximab is probably superior to placebo for preventing disease relapse for patients who have shown response to infliximab. It may also be superior to placebo for preventing loss of response in patients with fistulating disease. It may be similar to placebo in terms of total adverse events.\nInfliximab combined with purine analogues is probably superior to purine analogues alone for preventing disease relapse, both clinically and endoscopically, for patients in remission, who have shown response to infliximab.\nInfliximab may be similar to the biosimilar for preventing clinical relapse, and it may be slightly worse in preventing loss of clinical response, for patients with active disease who have shown response to infliximab. Infliximab may be worse than the biosimilar in terms of withdrawals due to adverse events. Infliximab may be similar to the biosimilar for serious and total adverse events.\nWe cannot draw any conclusions about any other comparisons or effects because of the very low quality of the evidence.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nA lot of the evidence is of low and very low quality. This is because of problems with the methodology, lack of planning, limited participant numbers, and problems with the reporting of the data in the included studies.\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThis review is up to date to June 2023.",
