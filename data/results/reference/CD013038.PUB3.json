  "text": "Does exposure to the smell and taste of milk accelerate feeding in tube‐fed preterm infants?\n\nKey messages\n• Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time it takes preterm infants to reach full sucking feeds.• We found no evidence of any unwanted effects of exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds in newborn infants.\nWhat is tube feeding?\n\nInfants born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) often need to be fed via a thin tube inserted through the mouth (orogastric tube) or nose (nasogastric tube) into the stomach until they are able to suck all of their feeds.\nWhy is the smell and taste of milk important for tube‐fed babies?\n\nInitially, only small volumes of milk are given, and this is gradually increased depending on how well the babies tolerate the milk. Smell and taste have a significant role in helping with digestion and absorption of food, and since infants being fed by a tube may not experience the smell or taste of milk, they might be taking longer to tolerate larger volumes of milk.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if exposing infants to the smell and taste of milk before or while they were being fed through a tube could help them tolerate greater volumes of milk more quickly and improve their overall growth and development. We also wanted to know if this method had any unwanted effects.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated exposing preterm infants to the smell or taste (or both) of milk with tube feeds, compared to no such exposure. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated the certainty of the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and number of infants included.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe identified eight completed studies involving 1277 preterm infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.\nExposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time to reach full sucking feeds, but the results are very uncertain. Two studies reported that no infants had any unwanted effects related to exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk may have little to no effect on duration of intravenous nutrition (feeding through a vein), time to reach full enteral feeds (feeds though a tube into the stomach), or on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious intestinal disease), although the results for time to full enteral feeds are very uncertain. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk probably has little or no effect on the risk of developing an infection more than two days after birth.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because:\n• we identified few studies;• most studies were small and provided different types of exposure to smell and taste;• in many studies, clinicians and parents were aware of which treatment the infant was receiving; and• the studies did not investigate all the outcomes we were interested in.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review is current to April 2023.",
