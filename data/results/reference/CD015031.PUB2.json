  "text": "Is there a difference between pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap and pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling for large macular holes? Key messages 1. Pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap technique compared to pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling for treating macular holes may result in better vision after three or more months. 2. Pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap technique compared to pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling for treating macular holes probably results in a higher likelihood of macular hole closure 3. There is a need for high‐quality research in this area to confirm these results and measure other effects of the different surgeries. What is macular hole? The macula is a small area in the center of the retina (the light‐sensitive layer of cells lining the back of the eye). A macular hole is a gap that opens in the macula. Macular holes vary in size, and can be idiopathic (occurring spontaneously without a specific underlying disease), traumatic (caused by an injury), and myopic (associated with near‐sightedness). What is pars plana vitrectomy? Vitrectomy is removal of the vitreous humor (the gel that naturally fills the eye). It is a crucial step to be able to access the retina. The pars plana is part of the eye that does not touch critical internal eye structures such as the retina. In pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), the eye surgeon inserts the surgical instruments through the pars plana to avoid damaging the retina or adjacent eye structures. What is internal limiting membrane peeling and internal limiting membrane flap? The internal limiting membrane (ILM) is the innermost layer of the retina. ILM peeling and the ILM flap technique are used to treat macular holes. Peeling refers to complete removal of the ILM from the retina surrounding the macular hole. The ILM flap technique involves separating a portion of the ILM from the retina and inverting it to cover the macular hole. What did we want to find out? We wanted to examine whether PPV with the ILM flap technique was better than PPV with ILM peeling for treating large macular holes. What did we do? We searched for studies that evaluated PPV with ILM flap versus PPV with ILM peeling for treatment of large macular holes. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found four studies that had treated 285 eyes of 275 people diagnosed with large macular holes. The average age of the people taking part was 59.4 years to 66 years. Two studies were conducted in India, one in Poland, and one in Mexico. No studies reported conflicts of interest or financial support. PPV with ILM flap compared to PPV with ILM peeling may result in better vision and probably increases the likelihood of macular hole closure. What are the limitations of the evidence? In three of the four studies, the people measuring the results of the surgery may have known which treatment each study participant had received, and this knowledge may have influenced their assessments. The studies reported the results at different time points after surgery, which may have affected the assessment of vision. There were some differences in the surgeries across the studies; for example, in two studies, all people had cataract surgery combined with PPV. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to December 2022.",
