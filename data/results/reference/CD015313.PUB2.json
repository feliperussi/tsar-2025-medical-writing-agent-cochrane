  "text": "Mucolytics (drugs that break down mucus) for children with chronic suppurative lung disease\n\nKey messages\n‐Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if mucolytics are helpful for children with chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). We found only one small study with design limitations.\n‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of mucolytic medications in children with CSLD.\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD)?\n\nChronic suppurative lung diseases are conditions associated with chronic infection and inflammation of the airways with excessive mucus, leading to a daily wet cough for the children affected. They include the conditions of protracted bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis. If treated properly in childhood, the cycle of ongoing infection, inflammation and disruption of the airways' ability to clear mucus can be broken and so prevent and even reverse lung damage.\nHow is CSLD treated?\n\nThe two main aspects of treating CSLD are appropriate use of antibiotics and chest physiotherapy, which improves airway clearance. Chest physiotherapy aids in the clearing of mucus from the airways and can be manual techniques, such as percussion of the chest wall (which involves rhythmically striking the chest wall with cupped hands to loosen mucus from the walls of the airways, making it easier to cough up) and breathing and huffing exercises. Both aspects can help improve disease management, such as reducing the number of flare‐ups, improving lung function and quality of life.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nMucolytics are drugs which can help break down mucus and make it easier for children to cough up and so, potentially, may be very helpful for this condition. We wanted to find out if there was any evidence as to how helpful mucolytics are for children with CSLD, including with bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis, in preventing exacerbations, improving children's lung function and improving their quality of life.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched databases and registries for studies that compared a mucolytic with a dummy treatment or no treatment in children aged 18 years and under with CSLD.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found only one small study which assessed a mucolytic (inhalation of hypertonic saline) in 63 children with bronchiectasis, with results reported for 52 children.\nMain results\nWhilst a small single study found that using inhaled hypertonic saline before chest physiotherapy in children with CSLD might reduce the number of flare‐ups and improve lung function, when compared to not using nebulised hypertonic saline before chest physiotherapy, the evidence is not certain.\nWe also found two ongoing studies, one using hypertonic saline and one using a mucolytic taken by mouth (erdosteine), which will potentially be included in future updates of this review.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThere are serious limitations to the evidence as the study was small and only lasted eight weeks. We also had concerns about study design; for example, people knew which treatment the children were getting. The study did not report on unwanted effects or quality of life. We did not find any studies on other mucolytics, such as oral mucolytics, studies of treatment given during a bronchiectasis flare‐up, or for other diseases like protracted bacterial bronchitis, and there were no studies that took place outside of hospital. Further research is necessary to answer this important clinical question.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe search was undertaken up to September 2024 and the included study was published in 2021. Thus, this review is up‐to‐date but limited due to being based on a single small study with design limitations.",
