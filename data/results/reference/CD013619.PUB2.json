  "text": "Family presence during resuscitation\n\nWhy is this question important?\n\nPatients and their relatives increasingly expect to be actively involved in the decisions of treatment. However, there are concerns that family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) can lead to post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)‐related symptoms in relatives, or have a negative impact on the performance of healthcare professionals, thereby hampering the quality of critical care. There are also concerns that patient confidentiality can be violated, as the patient's thoughts and preferences in the situation are unspoken. The needs of all participating individuals must be balanced, as the actions involving patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals is seen as a triangular relationship that may impact one another.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to examine the existing evidence for the effect of FPDR, including cardiac arrest, trauma, and acute medical care.\nThe primary aim of this review was to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during cardiac arrest, trauma, or acute medical care of their loved ones affects the occurrence of PTSD‐related symptoms in the relatives.\nThe secondary aim was to investigate how offering FPDR affects the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and grief in the relatives, and what effect FPDR has on the length of time the medical care is performed, how healthcare professionals are affected, the quality of medical care, and patient's chance of survival.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched medical databases on 22 March 2022 without any language limits. We checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of adults who were present during resuscitation of their relative.\nWhat we found\nWe included 2 trials (3 papers) involving a total of 595 participants who were between the ages of 19 and 78. One trial involved 15 pre‐hospital emergency medical services units in France, investigating FPDR in patients with cardiac arrest. This trial had a one‐year evaluation that we included in the review. The other included trial was a small pilot study of FPDR in patients with cardiac arrest or trauma in an emergency department in the UK.\nKey results\nThere was not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of FPDR on any of the outcomes studied. Overall, it appeared that FPDR decreased PTSD, anxiety and depression, and grief; however, as the studies are very few and were at high risk of bias, this effect is very uncertain. One of the included studies also measured duration of patient resuscitation and personal stress in healthcare professionals during FPDR and found no difference between study groups.\nHow reliable are the results?\n\nOur confidence (certainty) in the evidence is very low. There is too little evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of FPDR on psychological outcomes of relatives or any other of the outcomes studied.",
