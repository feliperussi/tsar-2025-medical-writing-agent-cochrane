  "text": "Is 'TENS' (electrical nerve stimulation through the skin) an effective treatment for period pain and does it cause unwanted effects?\n\nKey messages\n• Overall, both high‐frequency and low‐frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may reduce pain compared with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment.\n• We are uncertain about the effects of high‐frequency TENS compared with low‐frequency TENS, the effects of both high‐ and low‐frequency TENS compared with other treatments (acupressure, acetaminophen, interferential current therapy), and unwanted effects.\n• Future studies should investigate unwanted effects, and also the effectiveness of TENS on the need to use additional painkillers, daily activities limited by pain, and quality of life. Studies should involve more women and use robust methods.\nWhat is period pain?\n\nPeriod pain is cramps in the uterus and pain or a constant ache in the lower stomach and the lower back and legs. It usually occurs at the beginning of a monthly period (menstruation). It is very common in women and girls of childbearing age. Many women take over‐the‐counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). However, some women cannot use these medicines due to unwanted effects, or other health problems.\nWhat is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) and how might it help?\n\nA TENS machine is a small, portable device with pads (electrodes) that stick to the skin over the source of pain. It is usually used by women themselves, at home, when they start to experience pain. The machine sends a small electrical current through the skin to the affected area, which may give a tingling sensation. TENS doesn't stop cramps or pain, but it is thought that the current blocks pain signals from nerves to the brain, which reduces the feeling of pain. TENS may also help the body to produce 'endorphins', which are the body's natural painkillers. TENS is inexpensive and may have fewer unwanted effects than medications. Unwanted effects may include slight redness or irritation of the skin around the electrodes. It is possible to vary the frequency and strength of the electrical current, described as high‐frequency TENS or low‐frequency TENS.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if TENS can relieve period pain without causing unwanted effects. We were interested only in the effects of TENS on women whose pain was caused by periods, not due to any other condition. We wanted to know if high‐frequency TENS was more effective than low‐frequency TENS, and whether TENS was more effective than a placebo (dummy) treatment or no treatment, or other treatments for period pain.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated high‐ or low‐frequency TENS compared with a placebo or no treatment, or another treatment. Studies could take place anywhere in the world as long as they included women and girls with period pain.\nWhat did we find?\n\nFor this review, we included 20 studies with 585 women with period pain. Studies were published between 1985 and 2019. They mostly took place in Brazil, the USA and Sweden, with others in South Korea, Japan, Iran, Norway, Turkey, Taiwan and India.\n• High‐frequency TENS compared with placebo or no treatmentmay reduce pain (10 studies, 345 women) but we don't know if there is any difference in unwanted effects (3 studies, 146 women).• Low‐frequency TENS compared with placebo or no treatmentmay also reduce pain (3 studies, 645 women). No studies reported unwanted effects.• High‐frequency TENS compared with low‐frequency TENS:we don't know which has more effect on pain (3 studies, 54 women). One study reported that no unwanted effects occurred.• High‐frequency TENS compared with other treatments:the only other treatments we found were acupressure (1 study, 18 women), acetaminophen (paracetamol)(1 study, 20 women), and 'interferential current therapy', which is similar to TENS but with a stronger electrical current (2 studies, 62 women). We don't know if there was any difference between high‐frequency TENS and these treatments. There may be no difference in unwanted effects.• Low‐frequency TENS compared with other treatments: the only other treatment we found was acetaminophen (1 study, 20 women). We don't know if there was any difference between the two treatments. No studies reported unwanted effects.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOverall, our confidence in the evidence was low to very low. This was mainly because we found a small number of studies, and they did not include many women. In particular, unwanted effects were poorly reported in most studies.\nHow up to date is the evidence?\n\nThis new review replaces a review published in 2009. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",
