  "text": "Use of dexmedetomidine to reduce pain and induce sleep in newborn babies who need life support ventilation\n\nKey messages\n1. Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that is used to relieve pain and induce sleep. It is used in newborn babies who need mechanical ventilation (a machine to assist breathing). We found no evidence to support using or not using dexmedetomidine in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation.\n2. Well‐designed studies are needed to determine the benefits and harms of dexmedetomidine in newborn babies, particularly in very preterm babies, as they are the sickest.\nWhat is dexmedetomidine?\n\nDexmedetomidine is a sedative. Sedatives work by helping a person to relax and feel calm; often people fall asleep after taking a sedative. Dexmedetomidine also has pain relief properties. Dexmedetomidine is given to people of all ages to help them relax and feel less pain during intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and stressful diagnostic or surgical procedures.\nWhy is this important for newborn babies who are on mechanical ventilation?\n\nAbout 9% of all newborns are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) directly after birth. Many of these infants require help breathing and are on mechanical ventilators. Mechanical ventilation and time in the NICU are stressful for babies. Pain and stress in newborns lead to long‐lasting complications (into adulthood). Medicines to relieve pain and reduce stress are therefore often needed during intensive care.\nTo reduce the pain and stress associated with ventilators, infants are usually given pain relief medicines like opioids (morphine, fentanyl) combined with midazolam. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine (sedative) and helps to relax the baby. Morphine and fentanyl both have serious side effects such as physical dependency, withdrawal problems, and slowed digestion and breathing.\nDexmedetomidine may be used in place of opioids and benzodiazepines, or in combination with smaller doses of opioids. Dexmedetomidine does not affect respiratory drive (the infant does not forget to breathe), simplifying assistance during kangaroo care (skin‐to‐skin contact).\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is an effective and safe medicine to use for pain and stress relief in sick newborn babies who need mechanical ventilation.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at dexmedetomidine compared with opioids (such as morphine or fentanyl), non‐opioid relaxing medicines (such as ketamine, midazolam, phenobarbital, or propofol), or placebo (dummy treatment) in sick newborns in need of mechanical ventilation.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe did not find any studies comparing dexmedetomidine with relaxing medicines or placebo. We found four ongoing studies comparing dexmedetomidine with fentanyl, morphine, and ketamine plus dexmedetomidine. We are unsure if these studies will help answer the question about using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in babies on mechanical ventilation, because we do not yet know if the babies in the studies will need mechanical ventilation.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe did not find evidence to support using or not using dexmedetomidine to reduce pain and discomfort in preterm infants on mechanical ventilation.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to September 2023.",
