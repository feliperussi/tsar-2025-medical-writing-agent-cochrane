  "text": "Higher‐protein formula versus lower‐protein formula: which works better to prevent malnutrition and obesity in infants? Key messages 1. We are unsure if high‐protein formula affects malnutrition or obesity in infants. 2. Larger studies are needed to further evaluate the benefits and potential harms of the different types of formula. 3. Future research should focus on long‐term growth and brain development. What are high‐ and low‐protein infant formulas? Infant formulas have a similar nutritional content to breast milk, and contain ingredients such as cow's milk, fats, vitamins, proteins (such as whey or soy protein), and carbohydrates. Depending on the amount of protein they contain, formulas are categorized as low‐protein (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal), standard‐protein, or high‐protein (2.5 g or more per 100 kcal). Why is it important to study infant formula? Despite World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, many full‐term infants around the world are fed formula instead of breast milk. Some infant formulas contain more that the recommended amount of protein; they are designed to increase weight gain in infants during the first year of life. However, we do not know the effect of high‐protein formula on malnutrition, overweight, or obesity during infancy. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out whether high protein formula is better than standard or low protein formula for preventing: 1. malnutrition (low weight for age, low height for age, or low weight or height); 2. overweight or obesity (high weight for height); and 3. other unwanted events. What did we do? We searched for studies examining higher‐protein formula compared with lower‐protein formula in healthy infants of either sex, born at nine months of pregnancy and with normal birth weight and height. We compared and summarized the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 11 eligible studies involving 1885 healthy, full‐term, formula‐fed infants. Seven studies (1629 infants) compared high‐protein formula with standard‐protein formula, and four studies (256 infants) compared standard‐protein formula with low‐protein formula. The biggest study included 1090 infants, and the smallest study included 20 infants. Ten studies were conducted in Europe and one in the USA. Most studies lasted approximately four months; only two studies lasted five years or more. Pharmaceutical companies funded all the studies. Overall, we are unsure if feeding healthy infants high‐protein formula compared to standard‐protein formula has any effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity in the first year of life. We are unsure if feeding healthy infants standard‐protein formula compared to low‐protein formula has any effect on undernutrition in childhood. The occurrence of unwanted events in formula‐fed infants may be unrelated to the protein content of the formula. What are the limitations of the evidence We are not confident about the evidence because the studies provided information in different ways, and the results varied considerably across studies. Moreover, some studies had many dropouts, which could have affected the results. Further research is likely to modify the results of this review. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to October 2022.",
