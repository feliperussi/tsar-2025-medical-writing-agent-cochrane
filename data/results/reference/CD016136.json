It is caused by insufficient levels of iron in the blood. When there is not enough iron in the blood, the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin, the molecule needed for oxygen to be carried to every living cell. People with iron deficiency anaemia can experience fatigue, weakness, headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath.\nHow do iron therapies treat iron deficiency anaemia?\n\nIron therapies help increase the amount of available iron in the blood and can, therefore, increase haemoglobin levels, provided there are no other causes of anaemia. Two main forms of iron therapy are intravenous (injected into a vein) and oral (by mouth). Within these two groups are multiple preparations and many forms of iron therapies that can be used to treat iron deficiency anaemia.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if intravenous iron is better than oral iron at treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy and to explore any unwanted effects caused by the different routes of administration.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for all available studies looking at the effects of intravenous iron compared to oral iron in pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 13 studies involving a total of 3939 pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia. Most studies looked at women's anaemia status between three and six weeks after they had received intravenous or oral iron. The 13 studies were published over 20 years, between 2002 and 2024.\nWe found that intravenous iron is likely better at treating iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy than oral iron. Intravenous iron given during pregnancy may slightly reduce severe anaemia after birth compared to oral iron, but we are very uncertain about the results. There did not seem to be a difference between intravenous and oral iron in the ability to prevent heavy bleeding after childbirth or the need for blood transfusion. Serious unwanted effects, including death, were rare and may not be increased with intravenous iron compared to oral iron.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident that intravenous iron improves haemoglobin levels and anaemia during pregnancy compared to oral iron. However, we have moderate to very low confidence in the evidence for unwanted effects of treatment because this information was reported differently across studies. Also, serious unwanted effects were rare, making it difficult to confidently say whether intravenous iron has more risks than oral iron.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to March 2024.",
