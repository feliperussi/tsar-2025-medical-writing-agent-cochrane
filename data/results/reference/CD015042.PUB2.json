  "text": "Treatments to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy\n\nKey messages\nWe found that among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy, brief psychosocial interventions (BIs) may increase the number of continuously abstinent women when compared to treatment as usual (TAU). There may be no difference between groups in the number of drinks per day, but the evidence is very uncertain. Receiving a BI compared to TAU probably results in little to no difference in the number of women who completed treatment.\nWhat are the consequences of alcohol use during pregnancy?\n\nAlcohol use during pregnancy can have severe consequences for both the pregnant woman and the embryo and fetus. Higher amounts of alcohol are associated with the greatest risk; however, low‐to‐moderate prenatal alcohol exposure is also linked to certain deficits at birth. Accordingly, any alcohol use confers some risk during pregnancy, and current guidelines recommend avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy. Nevertheless, in Europe, approximately one out of four pregnant women report alcohol use during pregnancy.\nWhich treatments are available to stop or reduce alcohol use during pregnancy?\n\nPsychosocial interventions and medications have been shown to be effective for unhealthy alcohol use within the general population. Those with alcohol use disorder (AUD), a mental disorder where the person is unable to control their alcohol use, may additionally benefit from medications. It is unclear if these treatments are effective among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether psychosocial interventions or medications can help pregnant women who report alcohol use in reducing or stopping such behaviour.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared psychosocial interventions or medications, or both, with no treatment, TAU, placebo (dummy treatment), or other treatments to help pregnant women stop or reduce their alcohol use.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included eight studies involving a total of 1369 pregnant women who reported alcohol use during pregnancy. In two studies, almost half of the participants were diagnosed with current or previous AUD. Most studies (75%) took place in the USA. Treatments were BIs, ranging from 10 to 60 minutes in duration, mainly delivered in a single session or few sessions (up to five). The group receiving BIs was compared with a group receiving TAU. Pregnant women received the psychosocial intervention at approximately 15 weeks of pregnancy, and alcohol use was assessed 8 to 24 weeks after the intervention. We did not find any study that looked at the effects of AUD medications during pregnancy.\nWe found that BIs may increase the rate of continuously abstinent women. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of BIs on the number of drinks per day. Finally, we found that BIs probably result in little to no difference in the number of women who completed treatment.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe did not find any study that assessed the effectiveness and safety of AUD medications during pregnancy. Only two studies recruited pregnant women with current or lifetime AUD; this limitation means we cannot generalise our results to pregnant women who have AUD. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of psychosocial interventions or medication in helping pregnant women with AUD to stop or reduce alcohol use.\nThe effects of psychosocial interventions are largely influenced by the social context; given that most of the included studies took place in the USA, this limits the generalisability of the findings to countries and marginalised ethnic groups not recruited to these studies.\nGlobally, our results are far from being considered conclusive.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to 8 January 2024.",
