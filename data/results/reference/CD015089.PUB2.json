  "text": "Head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination for causes in the brain of acute dizziness Key Messages The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations were reasonably accurate for diagnosing a central cause for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). What is acute vestibular syndrome? Acute vestibular syndrome is a specific type of dizziness, which can include severe vertigo (spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. Acute vestibular syndrome can be due to peripheral causes (those within the ear canal) or central causes (those within the brain). Clinicians can assess for the cause using risk factors, personal history, examination findings, or advanced imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). What are the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations? The head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) examination is a three‐step examination performed by clinicians to determine if AVS is due to a peripheral or central cause. This includes assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning a person's head (head impulse), assessing the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and assessing whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an assessment of auditory function (hearing). What did we want to find out? This review looked at how accurate the HINTS or HINTS Plus examination is in determining if a person's AVS is due to a central cause. What did we do? We looked for studies of adults (aged 16 years or older) that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS or HINTS Plus examination compared with a gold standard of advanced imaging or final diagnosis by a neurologist. What did we find? We found 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants. Twelve studies assessed the HINTS examination; five assessed the HINTS Plus examination. Most studies were performed in the emergency department; half were performed by neurologists. The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations had good sensitivity and reasonable specificity for diagnosing a central cause for AVS. What are the limitations of the evidence? The included participants, clinician training, clinician specialty, and clinician experience varied across studies. Study outcomes focused primarily on a single central cause (stroke), while only a few assessed for broader causes, such as intracranial bleeding, intracranial mass, or multiple sclerosis. How up to date is this evidence? This evidence is up‐to‐date to 26 September 2022.",
