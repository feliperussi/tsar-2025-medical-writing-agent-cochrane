  "text": "Anti‐VEGF for prevention of complications after vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy\n\nWhy is this question important?\n\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes. It is caused by abnormal new blood vessels that grow on the retina, the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye. Pars plana vitrectomy is an established surgical treatment for the complications of PDR. During this operation, the gel‐like substance that exists inside the eye, called the vitreous, is removed. The most common reason for performing vitrectomy is non‐clearing vitreous haemorrhage, where there is bleeding in the inner part of the eye called the vitreous cavity. When this occurs, vitreous loses transparency and the light cannot pass through it, causing vision loss. Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti‐VEGFs) are drugs that can stop these abnormal blood vessels growing and control the leaking blood, when they are injected inside the eye. The injection of anti‐VEGF agents before vitrectomy for the complications of PDR may make surgery easier, reduce intra‐ and postoperative bleeding and improve outcomes. However, there is no clear evidence about the different types of anti‐VEGF agents, the best time to use them or their effect on other outcomes. We reviewed published research to determine whether anti‐VEGF injections around the time of surgery have an effect on the outcomes of vitrectomy for the treatment of complications of PDR.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if the additional use of anti‐VEGF agents either before or during diabetic vitrectomy surgery was better than diabetic vitrectomy alone in terms of:\n‐ visual outcomes;‐ incidence of early and late POVCH;‐ incidence of revision surgery for POVCH in the first six months postoperatively;‐ incidence of revision surgery for recurrent traction/macular pucker (structural alteration in the macula, the part of the eye which is responsible for sharp, central vision, thus causing decline of visual function) in the first six months postoperatively;‐ vision‐related quality of life measures;‐ proportion of people with poor visual acuity (counting fingers or worse);‐ number of intraoperative retinal breaks (tears in the light sensitive layer of the eye);‐ frequency of silicone oil tamponade (a tamponade agent used to push the retina towards the eye wall and keep it stable).\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared any anti‐VEGF combined with vitrectomy versus vitrectomy with no anti‐VEGF or with sham treatment or with any other anti‐VEGF in people undergoing vitrectomy for the complications of PDR. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 28 studies that involved 1914 eyes undergoing vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Sample sizes varied from 20 to 214 participants. The studies were from China (11), Iran (three), Italy (two) and Mexico (two), and the remaining studies were from South Korea, UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, USA, Indonesia and Pakistan. One study was multi‐centre, including 13 clinical sites from nine countries. Two studies declared receiving funding from the manufacturer of the anti‐VEGF drug studied.\nMain results\nThe additional use of anti‐VEGFs in diabetic vitrectomy may improve visual outcomes at six months postoperatively. Their use also reduces the risk of late POVCH and probably reduces the risk of early POVCH. Anti‐VEGFs reduce intraoperative retinal breaks and may reduce the requirement for silicone oil tamponade.\nAnti‐VEGF use probably results in a lower need for revision vitrectomy for POVCH, and may reduce the need for revision surgery for recurrent traction and/or retinal detachment.\nWe found no studies to help us answer our question about quality of life and the proportion of people with visual acuity of counting fingers or less.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are confident that anti‐VEGF injections reduce the incidence of late POVCH and intraoperative retinal breaks (high‐certainty evidence), fairly certain that they reduce the incidence of early POVCH and the need for revision surgery for POVCH (moderate‐certainty evidence) but less certain about the effects on visual outcomes, revision surgery for retinal detachment and silicone oil use (low‐certainty evidence).\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up‐to‐date to 22 June 2022.",
