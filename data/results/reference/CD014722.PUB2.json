The review focused on children and adults living in low‐ and middle‐income countries.\nKey messages\nThe employment use of primary‐level and community workers may improve the mental health of adults and children living in low‐ and middle‐income countries. However, more evidence is needed.\nWhat was studied in this review?Many people who would benefit from mental health support cannot access these services. One reason for this is a lack of specialized mental healthcare staff. This is especially true in low‐ and middle‐income countries. To overcome this barrier, people without a professional background in mental health, such as nurses or teachers, can be trained to deliver some mental health services. In our review, we investigated whether this strategy helps to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders amongst adults and children. We also assessed its costs.\nWhat are the main results of this review?\n\nWe included 113 studies from a range of low‐ and middle‐income countries.\nThe studies assessed the effects of services carried out by primary‐level and community workers on people's mental health, quality of life, and social outcomes.\nWe grouped interventions depending on their overall objectives. Specifically, we refer to those targeting the whole population as 'promotion/universal prevention', those targeting people at risk for developing a mental disorder as 'selective prevention', and those designed for already presenting some sign of mental disorders as 'indicated prevention'. Below we report evidence of the results of low to moderate‐certainty, directly after the intervention. We did not present results for outcomes for which there was no or very uncertain evidence.\nPromotion/universal prevention interventions, compared to usual care:\n‐ probably slightly reduced anxiety symptoms in adults\n‐ may slightly reduce distress/PTSD symptoms in adults\n‐ may improve the quality of life of children\n‐ may reduce adverse events in children\n‐ may slightly reduce depression symptoms in children\n‐ may slightly reduce anxiety symptoms in children\nSelective prevention interventions, compared to usual care:\n‐ probably slightly reduced depressive symptoms in adults\n‐ may slightly reduce functional impairment in children\n‐ probably slightly reduced depressive symptoms in children\n‐ may slightly reduce anxiety symptoms in children\n‐ probably slightly reduced distress/PTSD symptoms in children\nIndicated prevention interventions,compared to usual care:\n‐ may reduce adverse events in adults\n‐ probably slightly reduced functional impairment in adults\n‐ decreased slightly functional impairment in children\n‐ decreased slightly depressive symptoms in children\n‐ may slightly reduce distress/PTSD symptoms in children\nIndicated prevention interventions delivered through task‐shifting may improve mental health outcomes.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe limitations of the evidence in this review stem from the absence of assessments related to the reduction in the incidence of mental disorders in the prevention studies, and the lack of discernible differences in acceptability. Furthermore, the limited number of randomized controlled trials reporting our secondary outcomes, and their low quality, failed to demonstrate clinically significant advantageous effects of the studied prevention interventions for some outcomes in both child and adult populations.\nHow up‐to‐date is the review?\n\nReview authors searched databases up to November 2021 to find and include all relevant published and unpublished trials.",
