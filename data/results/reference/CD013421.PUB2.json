The certainty of our findings was low or very low, because most of the studies had important limitations in the way they were conducted.\nWhat are anastomoses and sealants?\n\nIn vascular surgery, arteries and veins are often connected together using stitches. Such connections are known as anastomoses. When these connections are created, bleeding can occur from the needle holes of the sutures. Surgeons can use a variety of techniques to stop this bleeding (known as achieving hemostasis). The techniques used include applying pressure and other materials such as medicated foams that can be absorbed into the site. One type of material that is often used are sealants, which help recreate key steps of the body's natural clotting mechanism.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to compare sealants with other types of techniques or materials used to stop bleeding in vascular surgery.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe included 24 clinical trials that randomized 2376 participants and combined their results together using a standardized process to determine how effective sealants were in stopping bleeding in vascular surgery. The trials included anastomoses in vascular surgery and were primarily carried out in the United States and Europe, with a few taking place in the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries.\nWhat did we find?\n\nUsing sealants may result in faster time to stopping bleeding in the anastomoses, and sealants were potentially less likely to fail at stopping bleeding in comparison to other techniques or materials. However, using sealants did not clearly result in less bleeding, less operating time, less bleeding following surgery during recovery for 30 days, or lower likelihood of having to go back to the operating room for bleeding complications during recovery for 30 days. None of the studies reported any deaths because of sealant use, and none of the studies investigated whether using sealants provided a better quality of life for patients.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nMost studies did not specify how they randomized participants, or how they kept the randomization process hidden. This is important because randomizing participants properly, and keeping the process hidden, can make us more confident that the study is determining only the difference in the techniques and not something else. No studies prevented the surgeons or staff from knowing which technique or material was being used to stop bleeding. This is important because awareness of which technique or material was being used can influence the surgeons' or staff's judgment of how effective they are. Thirteen of the studies had high rates of participants not completing their follow‐up time period, or not completing the study for other reasons. All the studies had risk factors for introducing other sources of bias into the study.\nAs a result, the certainty of evidence was low or very low for all the outcomes.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nWe searched for studies up to March 2023.",
