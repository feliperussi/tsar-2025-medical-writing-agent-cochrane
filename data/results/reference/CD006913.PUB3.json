  "text": "Psychological interventions in inflammatory bowel disease\n\nWill persons with inflammatory bowel disease IBD) feel better when they get psychological therapy as well as their normal medication?\n\nKey messages\n1. Psychological treatments probably have small beneficial effects on quality of life and symptoms of depression and anxiety in grown‐up persons with IBD.\n2. There may be no effect on inflammation and bodily symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n3. In adolescents, psychotherapy is probably effective in improving quality of life. We are uncertain about the effects on depression, anxiety and inflammation.\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nInflammatory bowel diseases are a group of lifelong conditions that lead to an inflamed gut. The primary forms are called Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Sometimes, the diagnosis is undecided between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel disease is then called unclassified or indeterminate colitis. Persons with inflammatory bowel disease often suffer from gut problems such as pain, diarrhea and blood loss. Many patients also feel tired, depressed or anxious.\nWhat is psychological therapy?\n\nWe have defined psychological therapy in broad terms, as three main types: psychotherapy, education and relaxation. Psychotherapy helps people deal with thoughts and feelings. Education is applied for a better understanding of the disease and the difficulties which come with the disease. Relaxation helps people to calm down. We have looked at all these types because they are often combined and overlap.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out what types of psychological treatments have been examined in studies and whether the different psychological treatments make adults and children with the diseases feel better.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies on the effects of psychological therapies on children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease. We were particularly interested in the effects on quality of life. We also examined whether mood improved, whether people were less anxious and whether the inflammation was treated. The studies were checked for quality. We then summarized the results from all studies on the different types of psychological treatments.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 68 studies, but only 48 reported the information needed for our summaries. There were 6111 adult participants and 294 children and young people. All studies had a control group of persons who did not get psychological treatment or who got another type of treatment. In many studies, the treatments were combinations of psychological therapies: psychotherapy, education and relaxation.\nMain results\nIn adult people with inflammatory bowel disease, compared to no additional treatment:\n‐ Psychotherapy may improve the quality of life and decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety, but the effects were small.\n‐ Treatments which included education or relaxation may also slightly improve the quality of life and symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nIn children and young people with inflammatory bowel disease:\n‐ Psychotherapy improved the quality of life.\n‐ There was no information on the effect of education or relaxation.\nThe treatments may make little or no difference to inflammation and bodily symptoms.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nAll effects were small. There are many different treatments, and they can be difficult to compare. The type of treatment could not be hidden (blinded) from the participant, and there was no placebo or sham (mock treatment) for comparison. Therefore, the results from these studies cannot be as trustworthy as when a drug is examined (where blinding is possible). Also, many of the included studies were small.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe review is up to date to May 2023.\nWhat next?\n\nWe will conduct other analyses to find out which parts of the different treatments work best and for whom.",
