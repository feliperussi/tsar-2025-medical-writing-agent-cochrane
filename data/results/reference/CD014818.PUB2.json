It involves injecting pain‐numbing medicine near specific nerves in the breast area to block pain signals during and after surgery. Unlike opioids, which affect the whole body, regional analgesia targets only the nerves. Different regional analgesia techniques target different nerves, as shown below.\nParavertebral block: near the spine\nErector spinae plane block: along the back muscles\nPectoral nerve block: in the chest area\nSerratus anterior plane block: near the sides of the chest\nWhy is this important for women undergoing breast cancer surgery?\n\nPain after breast surgery can cause problems, lead to longer hospital stays, and even result in long‐term pain. Opioids, commonly used for pain relief, have side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Regional analgesia is important because it effectively reduces pain while avoiding the risks associated with opioids.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nThis review looked at how well regional analgesia techniques work and how safe they are. We compared different types of nerve blocks to see their effects on pain levels and possible complications.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for high‐quality medical studies that compared different types of nerve blocks for breast cancer surgery. We analysed their combined effects on pain and complications using advanced statistical methods. We evaluated erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block against paravertebral block.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 39 studies involving 2348 women. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023. The results of the most important outcomes are summarised below.\nFor reducing pain at rest two hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block is slightly more effective than paravertebral block, but this difference is not clinically meaningful. Compared with paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block is similarly effective, and serratus anterior plane block probably has similar effectiveness.\nFor reducing pain during movement two hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block may be more effective than paravertebral block. Erector spinae plane block and paravertebral block may be similarly effective.\nFor reducing pain at rest 24 hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block is slightly more effective than paravertebral block, but this difference is not clinically meaningful. Compared with paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block and serratus anterior plane block are similarly effective.\nFor reducing pain during movement 24 hours after surgery, compared with paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block probably has similar effectiveness, pectoral nerve block may be similarly effective, and serratus anterior plane block may be similarly effective, but the last result is very uncertain.\nFor reducing pain at rest 48 hours after surgery, one study reported no difference between paravertebral block and erector spinae plane block, but the result is very uncertain.\nFor reducing pain during movement 48 hours after surgery, pectoral nerve block and erector spinae plane block may be similarly effective compared with paravertebral block, but both results are very uncertain.\nIn the three studies that recorded complications of regional analgesia, no complications occurred.\nOverall, we found that the different regional analgesia techniques were similarly effective for managing pain management, and that all had low complication rates.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nSome factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. First, some comparisons included few studies and participants, making the results less reliable. Second, studies sometimes had different findings, making it harder to draw clear conclusions. Third, we excluded some studies from our analysis because we considered their methods were not sufficiently robust. Finally, where studies did not provide results, we had to calculate them ourselves, which may have added some uncertainty.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe review is current to 6 June 2023.",
