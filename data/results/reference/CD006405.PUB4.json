  "text": "Nasal high flow therapy for breathing support in preterm babies\n\nReview question\nIn preterm babies, what are the benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy (high flow) when used for breathing support soon after birth, compared with other types of non‐invasive breathing support?\nWhat is respiratory support and how is it treated?\n\nPreterm infants (born before their due date) often require support with their breathing soon after birth. Non‐invasive respiratory support is provided without placing a breathing tube in the baby's windpipe. There are several types of non‐invasive respiratory support. High flow is one type that delivers warm air and oxygen via two small prongs that sit inside the infant's nostrils. Alternatives to high flow include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), where continuous pressure (rather than flow) of oxygen is given via larger prongs or a mask, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) where, in addition to CPAP, inflations of oxygen at a higher pressure are occasionally given.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched medical databases for well‐designed studies evaluating the benefits and harms of high flow respiratory support in preterm infants compared to other forms of non‐invasive respiratory support.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 13 studies including 2540 preterm babies that compared high flow with other non‐invasive ways of supporting babies' breathing soon after birth. There are nine studies awaiting classification and 13 ongoing studies. The included studies differed in the treatments they compared, the flows of oxygen used, whether CPAP could be used if high flow did not work and the approach to the use of surfactant (a medication used to help prevent the small airways collapsing down) in babies with more severe breathing difficulties.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWhen used soon after birth in preterm babies, high flow may make little to no difference to death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a chronic lung disease in preterm babies) compared with CPAP or NIPPV. High flow probably increases treatment failure compared with CPAP. For example, babies treated with high flow might have needed higher oxygen concentrations or had worse blood test results. CPAP worked better than high flow in around 10 more babies out of every 100. However, high flow probably makes little to no difference to the likelihood of needing intubation (placement of a breathing tube). High flow probably caused less damage to the infant's nose, compared with CPAP or NIPPV and probably reduced the risk of pneumothorax (air in the space between the lung and the chest wall). There were very few extremely preterm infants (born before 28 weeks' gestation) included in these studies. Therefore, we remain unsure about the benefits and harms of high flow soon after birth for extremely preterm infants.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOverall, we have very low to moderate confidence in these findings. Our confidence is limited because clinicians in the studies knew which treatment babies received; the results varied widely as some studies showed benefit with one type of breathing support while other studies showed benefit with the comparator type of breathing support; and there were low numbers of events for some outcomes making it difficult to compare groups.How up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe search is up to date as of 12 March 2022.",
