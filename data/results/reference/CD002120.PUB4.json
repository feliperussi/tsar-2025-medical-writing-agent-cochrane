  "text": "Combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) as treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea\n\nReview question\nCochrane authors reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the treatment of painful menstrual cramps (period pains, also called dysmenorrhoea).\nBackground\nOCPs are readily used as a treatment for menstrual cramps, but the evidence was uncertain about the effects.\nStudy characteristics\nWe found 21 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the effects of OCPs with either placebo (fake pill), other OCPs, or non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory medicines that reduce pain and inflammation. The studies included 3723 women. Most women had painful menstrual cramps of at least moderate severity. Manufacturers of OCPs funded 11 studies. We searched the databases in March 2023.\nKey results\nOCPs compared to placebo\nOCPs reduce pain by 0.7 to 1.3 points more on the total dysmenorrhoea scale (range 0 to 6) than placebo in women with menstrual cramps (6 studies with 588 women; high‐quality evidence). The six studies that measured improvement as a yes/no category showed that OCPs may reduce pain. Women with a 28% chance of improving on placebo may have a 37% to 60% chance of improving on OCPs (low‐quality evidence).\nOCPs increase the risk of side effects (59% in placebo group compared to 71% to 86% in OCP group; moderate‐quality evidence), and may lead to more serious side effects (1.1% in placebo group compared to 0.5% to 6.8% in OCP group; low‐quality evidence).\nIrregular bleeding increases among women using OCPs. Women with an 18% risk of irregular bleeding on placebo have a 39% to 60% risk of irregular bleeding on OCPs (high‐quality evidence). Moderate‐quality evidence found that OCPs probably increase the risk of headaches (17% in placebo group compared to 19% to 35% in OCP group), and nausea (feeling sick; 10% in placebo group compared to 11% to 22% in OCP group).\nWe are uncertain of the effect of OCP on weight gain.\nLow‐quality evidence found that OCPs may slightly reduce the need for extra medicine (38% in placebo group compared to 15% to 37% in OCP group), and absence from work (36% in placebo group compared to 11% to 35% in OCP group).\nDifferent OCPs compared to each other\nThere may be little or no difference between OCPs that contain low or high doses of oestrogen, or between newer and older formulations of OCPs (moderate‐quality evidence).\nUsing continuous OCP (no inactive pills taken as a break between active pills, to postpone bleeding) might reduce pain more than the traditional regimen (low‐quality evidence). The traditional regimen is to take active tablets for 21 days and pausing for 7 days (or taking inactive tables for 7 days) where a breakthrough bleeding will usually occur.\nThere might be little or no difference in the risk of any side effects between the continuous and traditional regimens (65% in traditional group compared to 66% to 80% in continuous group; low‐quality evidence).\nDue to very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain if there is a difference in the risk of serious side effects (0.9% in traditional group compared to 0.3% to 7.7% in continuous group), headaches (8% in traditional group compared to 4% to 15% in continuous group), nausea (6% in traditional group compared to 3% to 13% in continuous group) or absence from work (9% in traditional group compared to 6% to 18% in continuous group). Continuous use of OCP probably increases irregular bleeding (33% in traditional group compared to 38% to 56% in continuous group; moderate‐quality evidence).\nThese studies did not report on weight gain or the need for extra medicine.\nOCP compared to a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory medicine\nDue to low‐quality evidence, we were unable to determine whether OCPs were more effective than non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory medicines. Side effects were not reported.\nQuality of the evidence\nThe quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high. The most important problems were a lack of data and variations in data between studies.",
