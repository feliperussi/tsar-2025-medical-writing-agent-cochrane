  "text": "Are digital health, technology‐driven, or technology‐assisted interventions helpful in managing obesity in children and adolescents?\n\nKey messages\n• Digital interventions may have small, short‐term beneficial effects on fat mass, but their effects on other outcomes are unclear.\n• No studies reported on the safety of interventions.\n• Future studies should report their results by age, gender, race/ethnicity; include the full data; include adverse events and other outcomes; control for both diet and physical activity in their analyses; and include the behavioral theory informing their intervention.\nWhy is obesity in childhood a problem?\n\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of developing long‐term diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Worldwide, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 were living with overweight or obesity in 2016.\nWhat are digital technologies, and how are they used in weight‐loss management?\n\nResearchers are exploring new ways of managing obesity in children and adolescents using digital technologies, including wearable devices, web‐based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, 'exergaming' and active video gaming, and telehealth (seeing or talking to your doctor from home using your phone, computer, or tablet). The advantages of these technologies may include:\n• being available at all times, helping to sustain a behavior over time;• lower care costs;• promoting health equity – that is, reducing unfair differences in health between different groups of people – as they are generally accessible and available to a large population.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know whether integrating digital technologies helps children and adolescents to lose weight, and if these tools are safe.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that explored digital technology, such as 'wearables' (a compact, portable electronic device that you wear on your body to track your diet, health, and/or fitness), web‐based tools, texting, mobile apps, exergaming, or telehealth, in the management of obesity in children and adolescents aged up to 19 years. We grouped the studies into two comparisons:\n• digital technology plus usual care versus usual care alone;• digital technology alone versus usual care alone.\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 15 studies involving a total of 911 children and adolescents. Five studies included children from 0 to 19 years old. Ten studies included only those aged 10 to 19 years. Nine studies lasted less than six months (short‐term studies); six studies lasted at least six months (long‐term studies).\nEight studies compared a digital technology plus usual care to usual care alone. The digital technology approach may reduce body fat by an average of 2.63% at the end of the study. This is a small but important improvement. The effects on other outcomes were unclear.\nSeven studies compared a digital intervention alone to usual care alone. The effects on the outcomes assessed were unclear.\nNo studies reported on the safety of these treatments.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe long‐term clinical meaning of the reduction in fat mass with a digital intervention combined with conventional care in this population is difficult to assess due to the limited evidence. Also, we have no evidence about the safety of these digital technologies, and there was not enough information to determine whether different age groups had different outcomes.\nHow current is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is current to 14 April 2025.",
