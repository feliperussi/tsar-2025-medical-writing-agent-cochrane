In places where general health checks and treatment are not free, resources like time and money also play a role. Some people avoid general health checks because they are afraid of bad results.\n• We found less information about healthcare funders and providers, so we do not fully understand what drives their decisions about funding or delivering general health checks.\n• People should think carefully about whether to have a general health check, weighing up the pros and cons and taking into account their own health and situation.\nWhat are general health checks?\n\nGeneral health checks are routine health examinations offered to people who feel healthy, especially in wealthier countries. They include screening for various cancers, and assessing people's risk of getting diabetes or heart disease. These checks are believed to help by spotting risks or diseases early so they can be treated, or so people can make changes to their lifestyle. However, there may be risks. For example, people might receive a wrong screening diagnosis and have to undergo further testing, and possibly unnecessary treatment. General health checks are expensive to provide, and research shows that they may not be effective for preventing heart disease.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nDemand for general health checks remains high, but we don't know whether they significantly help to reduce death, cancer and heart disease. We wanted to understand what factors lead policy‐makers, healthcare managers and providers, and clients to fund, provide and attend general health checks.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies where policy‐makers, healthcare managers, healthcare providers and clients shared their views and experiences. We evaluated the quality of each study individually and summarised the findings.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 146 studies, and selected 36 of them to analyse. Most studies took place in high‐income European countries, with a third from middle‐income countries in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Most clients, healthcare providers and policy‐makers had similar perceptions and experiences of general health checks. We developed 22 findings and judged our confidence in these findings to be high, moderate, low, or very low, indicating how likely the finding represents what we sought to study.\n1. We have high confidence in the evidence of the following findings.\n• Clients’ perceptions of the disease, prevention and risk affect uptake.\n• Both healthcare providers and clients believe that people who provide general health checks need to be skilled and understand the clients' culture.\n2. We have moderate confidence in the evidence of the following findings.\n• Many clients see general health checks as a way to get an objective health assessment, reassurance from health professionals and motivation for healthier living.\n• Clients who fear bad results or who only seek care when they have symptoms are less likely to attend.\n• Some clients feel a duty to their families or society to attend health checks, believing it helps maintain or improve their health.\n• Interaction with healthcare providers can either encourage or discourage attendance.\n• Availability, accessibility and clear information are crucial in clients' decision‐making process.\n• Factors like time, money and health insurance affect whether people attend.\n• Healthcare providers face barriers to delivering general health checks, like time constraints, staff shortages, limited resources, technical issues and complicated reimbursement processes. Some believe offering general health checks in locations like supermarkets or churches might improve access.\n• Healthcare funders, managers, providers and clients have different views on how beneficial general health checks actually are.\n• Healthcare providers and clients feel that raising awareness of general health checks, including their benefits and risks, requires clear information, effective invitation systems and educational efforts.\n3. We have low or very low confidence in the following findings.\n• Clients prefer a broad range of tests, while healthcare providers favour more tailored testing, based on the person's needs.\n• For clients, clear explanations of test results and recommendations are important. Everyone agrees that follow‐up care is essential to make general health checks meaningful.\n• Clients report that cultural background, social norms, religion, gender and language shape how people perceive prevention and disease, which influences their decision to attend general health checks.\n• Policy‐makers believe that a supportive political climate and backing from various groups are necessary to implement general health checks.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe tried to include a sample of studies representing diverse geographical regions, settings, and people. However, there were gaps in the research, so we could not get a clear picture of everything we were interested in. In particular, information about funders and providers is probably incomplete.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nWe searched for studies in January 2022 and August 2022. The studies that we analysed were published between 1995 and 2021.",
