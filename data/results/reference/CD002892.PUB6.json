  "text": "The effect of individual‐level interventions for reducing stress in healthcare workers\n\nKey messages\n‐ Individual‐level interventions in which one’s attention isonthe experience of stress (like focusing on thoughts, feelings, behaviour) orawayfrom the experience of stress (like exercising, relaxing) may reduce stress among healthcare workers up to one year after the intervention.\n‐ A combination of individual‐level interventions may reduce stress up to a couple of months after the intervention.\n‐ We do not know if interventions that focus on work‐related risk factors on an individual level have any effect on stress.\nWhat is stress?\n\nThere is currently no clear definition of (work‐related) stress. This review is about healthcare workers with low levels of stress to moderate distress and burnout, which might lead to depression and anxiety but does not have to. People with stress can experience physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension or pain, but also mental symptoms, like impaired concentration. They can also have behavioural problems (like conflicts with other people) and emotional problems (like emotional instability).\nWhat can be done about stress among healthcare workers?\n\nStress among healthcare workers can be tackled at an organisational level, but also at an individual level. Stress management interventions at the individual‐level aim to:\n‐ focus one’s attentiononthe experience of stress (thoughts, feelings, behaviour), for example by cognitive‐behavioural therapy or coping skills training;\n‐ focus one’s attentionawayfrom the experience of stress, for example by yoga, Tai Chi, drawing, or acupuncture;\n‐ alter work‐related risk factors on an individual level, such as alterations in work demands.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if various types of individual‐level stress management interventions are better than no intervention (or another intervention) to reduce stress among healthcare workers currently working as such.\nWhat did we do\nWe searched for studies that looked at stress management interventions in healthcare workers and reported on stress symptoms. The healthcare workforce comprises a wide variety of professions and occupations who provide some type of healthcare service, including direct care practitioners and allied professionals.\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and study size.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found a total of 117 studies that involved a total of 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies followed their participants up to three months and some up to 12 months, but only few longer than a year.\nWe found that there may be an effect on stress reduction in healthcare workers from stress management interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress. This effect may last up to a year after the end of the intervention. A combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. The long‐term effects of stress management interventions, longer than a year after the intervention has ended, remain unknown. The same applies for interventions on (individual‐level) work‐related risk factors.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe estimates of the effects of individual‐level stress management interventions may be biassed because of a lack of blinding of the participants in the included studies. Furthermore, many studies were relatively small. Taken together, our confidence in the effects we found is reduced.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up‐to‐date to February 2022.",
