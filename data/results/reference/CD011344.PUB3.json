  "text": "Do automated mandatory boluses of epidural medications provide superior labour pain relief than basal infusion?\n\nKey messages\n‐ When used to maintain epidural pain relief during labour, automated mandatory boluses are associated with lower incidence of pain requiring clinical intervention and medication consumption, compared to basal infusion.\n‐ Both automated mandatory boluses and basal infusion are comparable in their associated incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, and duration of labour epidural.\nWhat are the methods of maintaining epidural pain relief during labour?\n\nEpidurals are often used to provide pain relief during labour, and involve administration of local anaesthetic medications into the epidural space around the spinal column. Broadly, medications can be delivered via two techniques: basal infusion (BI) and automated mandatory boluses (AMB). With BI, medications are administered without interruption over an extended period of time, whereas AMB involves administration of medications at set time intervals with each dose delivered within a short period of time.\nThe superior method of delivering epidural medications would result in effective pain relief and low incidence of experiencing pain that requires anaesthesiologist intervention (also termed breakthrough pain). Also, it would be associated with lower incidence of epidural‐related adverse effects including caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery (use of forceps or vacuum device to assist delivery), prolonged duration of labour pain relief, and increased local anaesthetic consumption.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nPrior studies have reported contradicting data regarding which method (AMB compared to BI) provides superior pain relief during labour, and previous systematic reviews are outdated as there have been several new studies published on this topic. Inclusion of their data may improve the precision of our results regarding the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of AMB versus BI for maintenance of epidural pain relief during labour.\nHence, we aimed to compare AMB with BI in terms of:\n‐ incidence of breakthrough pain (pain occurring during labour epidural requiring anaesthesiologist intervention)\n‐ incidence of caesarean delivery\n‐ incidence of instrumental delivery\nAdditionally, we compared AMB with BI in terms of duration of epidural analgesia and local anaesthetic consumption.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared AMB with BI for labour epidural pain relief. We compared and summarised the results of these studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nOur review included 18 studies involving 4590 women at term with uncomplicated pregnancies. Overall, we found that AMB was associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and lower local anaesthetic consumption compared to BI, but both methods were comparable regarding the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, and duration of labour epidural.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence, but it was limited by two main factors. First, there were differences between the studies in their respective methods, which includes differences in the types of medications used, stage of labour at which the epidural procedures were performed, and use of concurrent forms of pain relief in addition to labour epidural. These differences between the included studies could have contributed to the observed differences between AMB and BI. Second, some of our results were based on data obtained from a small number of women, which may have limited the precision of our findings.\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to 31 December 2022.",
