Some or all embryos may be frozen, and are thawed and transferred to the womb at a later stage. This is called frozen‐thawed embryo transfer (FET).\nWomen with regular spontaneous periods (menstrual cycles) may be offered a range of cycle regimens to prepare the womb lining (the endometrium) for FET. Alternatively, FET can be carried out after spontaneous ovulation (release of an egg) in a natural cycle. This is called natural cycle FET.\nWomen with irregular cycles are either not ovulating or are ovulating randomly. Therefore, natural cycle FET is not suitable for them. These women can be offered either ovulation induction with fertility drugs or hormone therapy (HT) to prepare them for FET.\nThe most common regimens for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG (human chorionic gonadrotophin) to trigger ovulation, or endometrial preparation with HT with or without a gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to temporarily suppress ovarian function.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe conducted this review to find out if a particular FET regimen is more effective or safer than others. Our main outcomes were live birth rates and miscarriage rates per woman.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared one type of cycle regimen with another in subfertile women (including women with regular ovulation, irregular or random ovulation, or no ovulation). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 32 studies involving 6352 women. Most of the studies included women with regular ovulatory cycles. They provided little to no information about women with irregular or no ovulation cycles. The studies were conducted in Iran (11 studies), Belgium (four studies), Italy (three studies), plus two studies each in China, France, Israel, Turkey, and the UK; and one study each in Egypt, Singapore, Spain and the Netherlands.\nMain results\nThis review did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of one cycle regimen in preference to another in preparation for FET in subfertile women with regular ovulatory cycles. The most common approaches for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG to trigger ovulation or endometrial preparation with HT, with or without GnRHa suppression. We identified six direct comparisons of these two approaches, and there was insufficient evidence to support the use of one over the other.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the included studies were small with few results reported.\nHow current is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to 19 December 2022.",
