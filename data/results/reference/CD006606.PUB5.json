  "text": "What is the best therapy for women who produce too many eggs when having fertility treatment? Key messages – We do not know if in vitro maturation (growing immature eggs outside the body until they are mature enough for fertilisation) is better than in vitro fertilisation (treatment where eggs are fertilised with sperm in a laboratory) in increasing live births and pregnancies in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (where the ovaries do not produce eggs properly) who undergo fertility treatment. – In vitro maturation increases miscarriage and reduces ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (painful condition where the ovaries produce too many eggs) in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared to in vitro fertilisation. – There is little to no difference in premature births (before the due date) and the baby's development while in the womb, but more studies are needed. What is the problem? Women who have difficulty getting pregnant (reduced fertility) may need treatment to increase their chances of conceiving. This is where women take medication to stimulate egg growth, the eggs are removed and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory, and the fertilised egg is returned to the woman's womb. This is called in vitro fertilisation. Some women with reduced fertility have ovaries that do not produce eggs properly (called polycystic ovarian syndrome). If these women take medication to stimulate egg growth, they may produce too many eggs (called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). This causes the ovaries to swell and become painful and may cause serious illness or (rarely) death. When women with polycystic ovarian syndrome take medications to stimulate their ovaries, the eggs produced are often too immature to be fertilised by sperm, leading to low pregnancy rates. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome may benefit from the earlier retrieval of eggs if the eggs are matured in the laboratory before they are fertilised (called in vitro maturation). While successful pregnancies have been reported, there is concern about the health of the babies born. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if in vitro maturation is beneficial or harmful compared to in vitro fertilisation techniques in women with reduced fertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome. What did we do? We searched for studies investigating in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation techniques in women with reduced fertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study method and size. We were interested in live births (delivery of a live baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy), miscarriage (loss of pregnancy during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy), clinical pregnancy (a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound scan at seven weeks of pregnancy), ovarian hyperstimulation, premature births, and the baby's development while in the womb. What did we find? We found four studies. Two provided insufficient data, but the other two published their results in full. These two studies involved 810 women. Main results Live birth rate was similar between in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation, but our confidence in the evidence is very low (2 studies, 739 women). If 45 women out of 100 have a live birth following in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 13 and 53 women out of 100. In vitro maturation increases miscarriage compared to in vitro fertilisation (2 studies, 378 women). If 20 women out of 100 have a miscarriage following in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 20 and 40 women out of 100. In vitro maturation results in a large reduction in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (2 studies, 739 women). If 4 women out of 100 have ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 0 and 2 women out of 100. There may be little to no difference in clinical pregnancy, but our confidence in the evidence is very low (2 studies, 739 women). In vitro maturation probably results in little to no difference in premature birth (2 studies, 739 women) and our confidence in the evidence is very low about the baby's health, development, or genetics while in the womb (1 study, 351 women). What are the limitations of the evidence? There is still uncertainty about the effect of in vitro maturation on live births and clinical pregnancies compared to in vitro fertilisation because the study methods differed and did not include enough women to provide meaningful results. We are confident that in vitro maturation increases the chance of miscarriage, and reduces the possibility of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We are moderately confident in the evidence for premature birth due to the small number of women enrolled and have little confidence in the evidence for the baby's health, development, or genetics while in the womb due to the small number of women enrolled in only one study. These findings should be interpreted with caution. How up to date is the evidence? We reviewed the evidence up to February 2023. This is the third update of this review.",
