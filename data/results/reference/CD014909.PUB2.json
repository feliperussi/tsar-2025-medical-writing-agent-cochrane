To prevent these infections, bowel preparation before surgery is intended to reduce faecal contamination of the bowel and minimise bacterial colonisation.\nHow is the bowel preparation done?Preoperative bowel preparation can be done mechanically, using laxatives to rinse the bowel, or by taking oral antibiotics that lead to local decontamination. These two methods can be performed either alone or in combination.\nWhat did we want to find out?We wanted to find out whether combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation compared with mechanical or oral antibiotic preparation alone or no bowel preparation has an effect on:\n‐ the occurrence of surgical site infections\n‐ the occurrence of anastomotic leakages\nIn addition, we wanted to find out whether combined bowel preparation had an effect on mortality, the occurrence of mild or severe postoperative complications, the likelihood of postoperative ileus (bowel motility disorder) or the length of hospital stay. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether side effects of the bowel preparation interventions differ between combination therapy and sole mechanical, sole oral antibiotic, or no bowel preparation.\nWhat did we do?We searched for studies comparing combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with sole mechanical, sole oral antibiotic, or no bowel preparation in patients scheduled for colon or rectal resection.We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?We included 21 studies in which patients scheduled for colon or rectal resection were assigned either to a group receiving combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation or to a comparison group. The comparison group received mechanical bowel preparation alone in 17 studies, oral antibiotics alone in three studies, and no bowel preparation at all in one study. All participants received intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery. The studies included a total of 5968 participants, of whom 5264 were analysed.Most of the studies were conducted in industrialised countries in Europe or Asia. Bowel preparation was conducted over one to three days before surgery and the follow‐up period was 30 days in most of the studies. No industrial funding was reported by any of the studies, but only five of the 21 studies provided information on their funding.Overall, slightly more men (58%) than women (42%) were included. The average age of the study participants varied between 42 and 69 years.\nWe found moderate‐certainty evidence that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leakages without affecting mortality, the occurrence of postoperative ileus or length of hospital stay.When comparing combined bowel preparation with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation, we found low‐certainty evidence that there is little to no difference between the compared approaches.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?There are different reasons why our confidence in the evidence is limited.We are moderately confident in the evidence regarding the reduction of surgical site infections through combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, because different surgical strategies (in terms of surgical access and type and location of bowel resection) and also different methods of bowel preparation (in terms of agent, dose and timing) were used. We are also only moderately confident in the reduction of anastomotic leakage through combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, because just a few cases occurred across the included studies.Regarding the comparison of combination therapy with oral antibiotics alone, we have little confidence in the evidence because not enough studies examined this issue to be certain about the results of our outcomes. In addition, there are some concerns about the methods used in the included studies.As there is only one study, we also have little confidence in the evidence comparing combined bowel preparation with no bowel preparation.\nHow up to date is this evidence?This evidence is up‐to‐date as of December 2021.",
