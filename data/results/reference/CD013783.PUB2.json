  "text": "How accurate are toe‐brachial index and toe systolic blood pressures for peripheral arterial disease?\n\nKey messages\n‐ There is currently a lack of quality evidence to support the use of toe‐brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) to detect peripheral arterial disease, and clinicians should interpret these tests with caution.\n‐ More high‐quality studies with larger numbers of participants are required to increase the certainty of evidence.\nWhy is improving the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease important?\n\nPeripheral arterial disease affects approximately 236 million people globally. In peripheral arterial disease, the arteries that supply blood flow to the legs and feet are affected by fatty deposits (atherosclerosis), which leads to narrowing and can cause blockages. This can result in pain, wounds and gangrene, which can lead to amputation. Not recognising peripheral arterial disease when it is present (a false‐negative test result) may result in the condition not being appropriately treated or a delay in treatment. This could lead to increased rates of wounds, amputation and premature death. An incorrect diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary imaging or inappropriate prescription of cardiovascular risk‐reducing medications where there is no benefit to be gained and the potential for side effects. An incorrect diagnosis may also result in stress and anxiety for the patient.\nWhat is the toe‐brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure?\n\nClinicians have a variety of tests available to detect peripheral arterial disease, which are non‐invasive and can be performed by the bedside. Two of these tests are the toe‐brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP). TSBP is a blood pressure taken at the great or second toe. A small blood pressure cuff is wrapped around the toe and a Doppler, laser or photoplethysmograph probe is placed on the toe to detect a blood flow signal. The cuff is then inflated until the signal disappears, and then slowly deflated until the signal re‐appears. The pressure at which the signal returns is considered the TSBP. To measure the TBI, the TSBP is simply divided by the highest blood pressure of both arms, resulting in an index. Lower values indicate that peripheral arterial disease is present. A variety of different thresholds are used in practice and research.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the TBI and TSBP are for detecting peripheral arterial disease in people at risk of the condition. We also wanted to compare the accuracy of the TBI with TSBP.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that had investigated the accuracy of either TBI or TSBP for peripheral arterial disease, and examined the quality and certainty of these studies.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 18 studies: 13 evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only and four evaluated both TBI and TSBP. TBI was evaluated in 17 studies including 1927 participants and TSBP was evaluated in five studies including 701 participants. Studies were conducted in the USA, Australia, the UK, Japan, Korea, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, India and Iran. The mean reported age range of participants was between 63 and 83 years. The studies were carried out in people who were at risk of peripheral arterial disease, such as people with diabetes, kidney disease, older people or people with known risk factors. However, there were not enough studies and the studies we found were too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the overall accuracy of the tests for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOnly a small number of studies were included (18) and the studies were quite different from each other. This is because our inclusion criteria were broad and inclusive. However, this made it impossible to directly compare or pool (combine) the studies together. The studies that we included were generally of low quality, and we have low or very low confidence in the results. The included studies also had some important limitations in the way that they were conducted. This may have resulted in TSBP and the TBI appearing more accurate than they really are in some of the included studies.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThis review was conducted of all literature published up to 27 February 2024.",
