Colchicine, first used to treat illness in ancient Egypt, is an inexpensive medication that fights inflammation. It has been used to treat gout, liver diseases, and systemic connective tissue disorders. More recently, researchers have been studying its potential for preventing ACVD.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out colchicine's benefits and harms in preventing ACVD before it ever occurs (primary prevention) in the general population. Primary prevention is all about taking steps to prevent a disease before it even develops, rather than waiting until someone is already sick to start treatment. In the case of ACVD, this is especially important because it is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. By focusing on prevention, people can be helped to live longer, healthier lives with a resulting reduced burden on healthcare systems. One approach to primary prevention is using immunomodulating medications, which work by modifying the immune system's response. Colchicine is one example of this type of medication.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe looked at the effects of colchicine for primary prevention of ACVD, including heart attacks, strokes, death from cardiovascular causes, and death for any reason. We also looked at unwanted effects such as diarrhoea and neurological events (seizure and mental confusion). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 15 studies involving 1721 participants with follow‐up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks, comparing colchicine with placebo (dummy pill), immunomodulating medications, or usual care. Colchicine was taken by mouth as a pill, either once or twice a day, depending on the regimen being followed. The people included in the studies were adults at high risk for developing ACVD, but who had not yet had a major cardiovascular event like a heart attack or stroke. The risk factors considered included age, family history, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and presence of other conditions like diabetes.\nMain results\nThe evidence for the effects of colchicine on preventing cardiovascular events is very uncertain. Although the current evidence does not suggest clear benefits or a reduction in ACVD complications, this conclusion is limited by the quality of the evidence. Further high‐quality studies are essential to accurately determine the benefits and harms of colchicine for the primary prevention of ACVD.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low because of concerns about how some of the studies were conducted, results that differed across studies, and changes to the intended populations or treatments. The studies were very small, and analyses included only a few studies.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to 31 May 2023.",
