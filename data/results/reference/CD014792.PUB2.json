  "text": "Do different methods of nutritional support affect recovery and complications in adults after pancreaticoduodenectomy?\n\nKey messages\n‐ Enteral nutrition may not increase the risk of complications but is probably linked to a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition.\n‐ When comparing jejunostomy feeding to oral nutrition, there may be no clear difference in complications or length of hospital stay, but the evidence is uncertain.\n‐ More evidence is needed to say with higher levels of confidence how these different types of feeding affect patients after a pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nWhat is pancreaticoduodenectomy?\n\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. It is often done for cancer but can also be used for benign tumours and chronic pancreatitis. The goal is to remove all cancerous tissue and help the patient live longer.\nWhat types of nutritional support are given after pancreaticoduodenectomy?\n\nAfter this surgery, patients need nutritional support to help them recover. This can be done in three ways:\n‐ Oral feeding: usually starting with fluids and gradually adding solid foods.\n‐ Enteral feeding (gastric or jejunal feeding): using tubes to deliver nutrition directly to the stomach or small intestine.\n‐ Parenteral nutrition: delivering nutrients through a central or peripheral vein, either as full nutrition (total parenteral nutrition) or partial nutrition.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to see how different methods of nutritional support affect recovery and complications in adults after pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe reviewed existing research from several medical databases up to October 2022. We included studies that compared different ways and timings of giving nutrition, focusing on those conducted in hospitals. We analysed 17 studies involving 1897 patients, with eight studies suitable for a detailed statistical analysis (meta‐analysis).\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe studies used various methods of nutritional support. Enteral feeding (through the small intestine) (jejunostomy, nasojejunal or gastrojejunostomy) was used in at least 13 studies. Parenteral nutrition was used in at least 10 studies. Oral intake was used in seven studies.\nWe found that there is likely a reduced length of hospital stay with jejunostomy feeding when compared to parenteral nutrition. There may be no difference in complications like pancreatic fistulas (a leak of pancreatic fluid into somewhere that is not into the inside of the gut wall), haemorrhage (major bleeding) or delayed gastric emptying (slow stomach emptying).\nWhen comparing nasojejunal feeding to parenteral nutrition, we found that there may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or complications like delayed gastric emptying or haemorrhage. We found that total parenteral nutrition may slightly improve rates of pancreatic fistula.\nWhen comparing oral nutrition with jejunostomy, we found that there may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay, delayed gastric emptying or haemorrhage.\nFurther high‐quality research is needed.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nThe level of evidence varied, with the majority of our findings based on evidence in which we have low or very low confidence. This was largely because only a few small studies have been conducted in this area. There was also wide variation in how nutritional support was provided across the studies.\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence includes studies and data available up to October 2022.",
