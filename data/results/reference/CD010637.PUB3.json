  "text": "Can physical exercise improve blood flow in people with chronic venous insufficiency?\n\nKey message\nThere is not enough evidence available to help us decide if physical exercise benefits people with chronic venous disease.\nWhy is this question important?\n\nVeins are a type of blood vessel that carry blood from the body back to the heart ('venous blood return'). The process is aided by contractions of a series of muscle pumps within the legs. Problems with the veins or muscle pumps in the legs in some people can impair this process, resulting in a condition known as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). CVI may cause pain, oedema (swelling due to fluid retention), and leg ulcers, and can impact a person's quality of life. It is thought that treatments such as physical exercise that increase the movement of the ankle joint and strengthen the muscle pump in the calf of the leg may help prevent the disease from getting worse.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared the effects of following exercise programmes with no exercise in people with CVI. In randomised controlled trials, the treatments people receive are decided at random, and these give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found five studies involving a total of 146 people with CVI that directly compared the effects of physical exercise with controls that did not include a structured physical exercise programme. The studies looked at possible changes in signs and symptoms of CVI; blood flow (measured by ejection fraction (the amount of blood the heart pumps each time it beats) and venous refilling index); quality of life; exercise capacity; muscle strength; and ankle joint mobility. Not all the studies reported on all of these outcomes, and the outcomes were measured in different ways. Most results came from small, single studies. None of the studies reported on new cases of venous leg ulcers or if surgical treatment was needed to relieve symptoms.\nHow certain are we about the evidence?\n\nAlthough some studies reported improvements in some outcomes after an eight‐week period and a six‐month period in the exercise group compared to the control group, we are uncertain if these equal real differences due to concerns about how the studies were designed and because the results were from small, single studies.\nHow up‐to‐date is the evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to 28 March 2022.",
