  "text": "What is the best treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n\nKey messages\n• There are currently no studies with information available to guide patients' and doctors' choices regarding treatments for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\n• It is difficult to conduct research in this area because relatively few people have this condition and the types of aneurysm they have vary.\n• Future research should explore how organisations that fund and oversee healthcare services could require or promote the inclusion of people with AAAs in studies testing different treatments.\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a widening of the wall of the aorta (the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body) to more than 50% of its original diameter. A diameter of greater than 5.0 to 5.5 cm (depending on a person's sex/gender) is considered potentially life‐threatening, with a risk of bursting. When the swelling occurs close to, next to, or above the arteries supplying the kidney, this increases the complexity of surgical treatment options.\nHow is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm treated?\n\nThere are different treatment options. Open surgical repair involves a major operation to open the abdomen and replace the diseased aorta with a fabric graft.\nEndovascular repair involves the use of X‐ray guidance to insert metal stents (small, tube‐shaped device placed inside a blood vessel) covered with fabric (endografts) via cuts made in the groin. When treating complex AAAs that are near the arteries supplying the kidneys, it is sometimes necessary to use specific endografts with windows (fenestrations) in them that allow for the kidneys and bowel to keep their blood supply when the endograft is inserted. This is called fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR).\nThere is also the option of not performing any procedures and counselling patients and their families, and in some cases, prescribing medications to manage their cardiovascular risk factors. This is called conservative management.\nIt is unclear which treatment is best for people with complex AAAs.\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out whether there are randomised controlled trials exploring whether FEVAR, open surgical repair, or conservative management is best for the treatment of complex AAAs. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that groups of participants are similar, and that investigators and participants don’t know who is in which group. In other words, RCTs aim to control factors that could impact on the results, such as people's background health, to allow fair comparison of the treatment options.\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared FEVAR with open surgical repair or conservative management of complex AAAs. We searched for studies performed up to March 2023.\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe could not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria. There is a lack of evidence to help us answer the question.\nHow current is the evidence?\n\nThe evidence is current to March 2023.",
