  "text": "Title: Is maturing eggs in the lab before IVF (in vitro maturation, IVM: a fertility technique where immature eggs are collected from the ovaries and matured in the laboratory) better than standard IVF (in vitro fertilisation, IVF: a procedure in which eggs are removed from an ovary and combined with sperm outside the body to form embryos) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS: a common hormone condition that affects how the ovaries work and can make it harder to get pregnant)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies where participants are assigned by chance to different treatments) with 810 women. The evidence is low to very low certainty (GRADE: a system that rates how sure we are about evidence). It is unclear whether IVM changes the chance of a live birth (live birth: the proportion of women who start a treatment and go on to deliver at least one living baby).\n- In cycles mostly using a GnRH antagonist protocol (GnRH antagonist: a drug that blocks hormones that trigger ovulation), IVM reduced moderate or severe OHSS (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a potentially serious reaction to fertility drugs where the ovaries become swollen and fluid can build up). However, IVM probably increases miscarriage per clinical pregnancy (clinical pregnancy: a pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound, usually by seeing a fetal heartbeat; miscarriage: an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week).\n- IVM probably makes little to no difference to preterm birth (preterm birth: birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or congenital anomalies (congenital anomaly: a problem present at birth, also called a birth defect). More large, well-designed trials are needed that compare modern IVM methods, such as capacitation IVM (capacitation IVM: a newer two-step lab method that aims to improve egg development), with current standard IVF.\n\nWhat is PCOS and how can it affect fertility?\nPCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) is a set of symptoms that affect the ovaries and hormone levels. It affects about 8% to 13% of women of reproductive age. It is present in around half of women who seek help for infertility (infertility: the inability to produce children). PCOS can cause irregular periods and make it harder to release an egg (oocyte: the female egg cell that can be fertilized).\n\nWhat are IVF and ICSI, and why can they pose extra risks for women with PCOS?\nIVF and ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection: a procedure where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to help it fertilize) are types of assisted reproductive technology (ART: procedures used to treat infertility). In standard IVF/ART, doctors give gonadotrophins (gonadotrophins: reproductive hormones such as FSH and LH given as injections to help eggs grow) to stimulate the ovaries. In women with PCOS, this can cause an excessive ovarian response and lead to OHSS.\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation (IVM) and why might it help women with PCOS?\nIn IVM, doctors collect immature eggs (oocytes) earlier and mature them in the lab (in vitro: in the laboratory). This approach uses fewer hormone injections and may lower the chance of OHSS. After lab maturation, eggs are fertilised (fertilisation: the process where a sperm joins with an egg to form an embryo) using IVF or ICSI.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if IVM followed by IVF or ICSI helps women with PCOS have a live birth. We also wanted to know about harms, including miscarriage, OHSS, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases (MEDLINE and Embase: large biomedical article databases, and CENTRAL: Cochrane’s register of controlled trials) and other sources for RCTs. We combined study results using meta-analysis methods and judged how certain the evidence was with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 4 RCTs with 810 women. Most trials used a GnRH antagonist protocol. The lab methods varied and included capacitation IVM. The reports gave few details on study duration, funding, countries, or participant characteristics. No data were available for cycle cancellation (cycle cancellation: stopping a fertility treatment cycle before egg retrieval or embryo transfer) or fertilisation rates (fertilisation: the process where sperm and egg join to form an embryo).\n\nOverall, we do not know whether IVM changes the chance of a live birth. IVM reduced moderate or severe OHSS. IVM probably increased miscarriage per clinical pregnancy. IVM probably made little to no difference to preterm birth or congenital anomalies.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\nThe trials used different lab methods and different groups of women. The number of trials and participants was small. Some key outcomes were not reported. These factors lower our confidence in the results and limit how well the findings apply to all clinics or people.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to February 2023.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nWe need more large, well-designed trials that directly compare modern IVM methods (for example, capacitation IVM) with current standard IVF. These trials should report live birth, miscarriage after clinical pregnancy, OHSS, and safety for mothers and children, including longer-term child outcomes.",
