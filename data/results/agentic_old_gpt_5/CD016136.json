Adverse events (unwanted effects of a treatment) were similar for IV and oral iron, but serious harms were too rare or poorly reported to be sure.\n- Most trials were in India and African countries, enrolled people at 13–37 weeks’ gestational age (how far along a pregnancy is, in weeks), and compared different IV iron products (iron sucrose; ferric carboxymaltose; ferric derisomaltose; ferumoxytol — names of IV iron medicines) with oral iron tablets (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate — types of iron supplements). Results varied by product and timing.\n- We need larger, well-designed trials that follow people through birth and the postpartum or postnatal period (the time after birth), directly compare IV iron products, use the same definitions, and report safety better so rare harms can be detected.\n\nWhat is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy, and why does it matter?\nIron deficiency anaemia (IDA) means the body lacks enough iron to make haemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein). Low haemoglobin can cause tiredness and breathlessness. In pregnancy, anaemia can raise risks around birth, such as heavy bleeding after birth (postpartum haemorrhage — dangerous heavy bleeding after childbirth), need for a blood transfusion (a procedure that gives donated blood through a vein), infections, longer hospital stay, or admission to an intensive care unit (ICU — the hospital unit for very sick patients).\n\nHow is iron deficiency anaemia treated during pregnancy?\n- Oral iron (by mouth) means taking iron tablets (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate — oral iron supplements). Tablets can cause nausea or constipation and can take time to raise haemoglobin.\n- Intravenous (IV) iron (into a vein) is given in a clinic or hospital. IV iron lets clinicians give larger doses faster but needs monitored administration (giving the drug and watching for reactions). IV products include iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, and ferumoxytol (IV iron medicines).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe asked whether IV iron or oral iron works better and is safer for IDA in pregnancy. We looked at haemoglobin level, correction of anaemia, postpartum haemorrhage (heavy bleeding after birth), need for blood transfusion, infections, length of hospital stay, ICU admission, deaths (mortality — number of deaths), breastfeeding (feeding the baby breast milk), mothers’ satisfaction and well‑being, and adverse events (unwanted effects).\n\nHow did we find and study the evidence?\nWe searched databases and trial registers to March 2024, including MEDLINE (a major medical database), Embase (a biomedical database), Cochrane CENTRAL (a trials database), ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization trial registry). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs — studies that randomly assign people to treatment groups). Where possible, we pooled results using meta-analysis (a method that combines results from several studies) and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach (a system for grading certainty in evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 13 RCTs with 3,939 pregnant people with haemoglobin below 11 g/dL. Most studies were in India and Africa. Participants started treatment between 13 and 37 weeks’ gestation.\n- Compared with oral iron, IV iron probably raised haemoglobin a few weeks after treatment and around birth (mean difference — the average difference between groups). IV iron probably reduced the chance of being anaemic at those times. After birth, IV iron may raise haemoglobin and may reduce anaemia, but we are very uncertain about effects on severe anaemia.\n- IV iron probably made little to no difference to postpartum haemorrhage and probably made little to no difference to need for blood transfusion or to breastfeeding. IV iron probably made little to no difference to severe infections or hospital length of stay and may make little to no difference to ICU admissions.\n- Adverse events were probably similar between IV and oral iron. Serious adverse events (major medical problems such as life‑threatening issues or hospitalization) were rare and were not consistently reported, so we cannot be sure about rare harms.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence for some outcomes and lower confidence for others. Concerns include possible lack of blinding (people may have known which treatment they received), different study settings and products, and few events for rare outcomes (imprecision). These issues lower certainty about safety.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We need larger, well-planned trials that follow people through birth and the postpartum period, compare IV iron products directly, and measure outcomes that matter to mothers (including satisfaction and well‑being).\n- Trials should use clear definitions and better safety reporting so we can detect rare harms.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is current to March 2024.",
