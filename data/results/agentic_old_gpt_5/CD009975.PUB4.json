  "text": "Title: Is using a video laryngoscope (a device with a camera that shows the vocal cords on a screen to guide placing a breathing tube) better than direct laryngoscopy (looking directly with a hand-held tool and light) for newborn babies?\n\nKey messages\n- Compared with direct laryngoscopy (looking directly into the throat with a hand tool and light), video laryngoscopy (a laryngoscope with a camera and screen) may increase success on the first try and may reduce the number of tries. The evidence is low certainty and comes from small studies with design weaknesses.\n- Video laryngoscopy probably lowers minor injuries to the mouth or airway (harm to the mouth or throat). Effects on drops in blood oxygen (desaturation: a fall in oxygen level) and slow heartbeat (bradycardia: a slow heart rate) are unclear.\n- The studies used different video devices (for example, C-MAC, Airtraq, GlideScope; brands of videolaryngoscopes) and were done in hospitals. This limits how sure we can be that results apply in all settings. Larger, better studies are needed.\n\nWhat is neonatal intubation and why does it matter?\nSome newborns (neonates, babies in the first 28 days of life) cannot breathe well on their own. Intubation (inserting a small tube through the mouth into the windpipe or trachea to help the baby breathe) secures the airway so oxygen (the gas we need to live) can reach the lungs. Getting the tube in quickly matters because delays can lower oxygen and cause harm.\n\nHow do clinicians place the breathing tube?\nClinicians use laryngoscopy (a way to view the voice box or larynx and the opening to the windpipe). With direct laryngoscopy (looking directly into the throat with a hand tool and light), the clinician guides the tube by direct view. With videolaryngoscopy (a laryngoscope with a camera that shows the glottis, the middle part of the larynx where the vocal cords are, on a screen), the clinician watches a monitor to guide the tube. Video views may make it easier to see the glottis (where the vocal cords are) and place the tube on the first try.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe asked whether videolaryngoscopy, compared with direct laryngoscopy, helps clinicians intubate newborns (0 to 28 days old) more effectively and safely. We looked at time to place the tube, number of attempts (tries), success on the first attempt, and safety outcomes such as desaturation (drops in blood oxygen), bradycardia (slow heart rate), and injury to the mouth or airway.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases, trial registries, and conference abstracts up to Nov 2022 for studies that compared video laryngoscopes with direct laryngoscopy in newborns. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach (a system for rating how certain the evidence is). We included randomized and similar trials where available.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 8 studies that provided data on 759 intubation attempts in hospital settings. The studies compared several video devices (C-MAC, Airtraq, GlideScope; each is a brand of videolaryngoscope with a camera and screen) with direct laryngoscopy. Reported outcomes included time to successful intubation, number of attempts, first-attempt success, episodes of desaturation and bradycardia during intubation, lowest oxygen level reached, and injury to the mouth or airway. Studies did not report other adverse effects.\n\nMain results\n- First-attempt success: Video laryngoscopy may increase the chance of success on the first try (low-certainty evidence).\n- Number of attempts: Video laryngoscopy may slightly reduce the number of tries needed (low-certainty evidence).\n- Time to intubate: Video laryngoscopy likely makes little or no difference to how long the procedure takes (low-certainty evidence).\n- Injuries: Video laryngoscopy probably lowers injuries to the mouth or airway during attempts (moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Oxygen and heart effects: We are uncertain whether video laryngoscopy changes how often desaturation or bradycardia occur during intubation (very low-certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference to the lowest oxygen level reached (low-certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations?\n- Most studies were small. \n- Staff and others could likely tell which device was used, which can introduce bias (flaws in study design or conduct that can favor one result).\n- Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\n- The studies used different devices and settings, so results may not apply to all hospitals, devices, or levels of staff training.\n\nWhat this means\nVideo laryngoscopy may help clinicians place breathing tubes on the first try and probably reduces minor airway injuries. However, the evidence is not strong. We need larger, well-designed studies to confirm these findings, compare specific devices, and measure outcomes that matter to babies and families, including safety (oxygen levels and heart rate), speed and success of tube placement, and how training and setting affect results.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our earlier review. The evidence is current to Nov 2022.",
