  "text": "Title: Do exercise programs help treat chronic venous insufficiency (a long-term problem where the leg veins and their valves do not move blood back to the heart well, causing swelling, aching, and skin changes that can lead to sores) in people without leg ulcers (a break on the skin or tissue surface)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found not enough good-quality evidence to know whether structured exercise programmes (planned sets of activities) help people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI; a long-lasting vein problem in the legs) who do not have leg ulcers. Across small studies, effects on symptoms, everyday wellbeing (quality of life; how someone feels and functions day to day), leg vein pumping and refill, walking ability, and muscle strength were unclear. No study reported whether exercise prevents leg ulcers, and studies did not report unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The exercise programmes differed by type, intensity (how hard), frequency (how often), and duration (how long). Results varied between the small studies, so we do not know which, if any, approach helps specific groups.\n- We need larger, well-designed randomized trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatments) that use standardised exercise programmes, follow people for longer, and measure outcomes that matter to patients, such as symptom relief, everyday function, development of leg ulcers, and unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why is it a problem?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long-lasting condition. The leg veins and their valves do not move blood back to the heart well. This poor return can cause swelling, aching or heaviness, cramps, itchiness, and skin changes. Over time, CVI can lead to slow-healing open sores called venous leg ulcers (an open sore on the lower leg or ankle). These problems can limit daily activities and lower quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day).\n\nHow is CVI usually treated, and where does exercise fit in?\nCommon treatments aim to improve blood return and ease symptoms. These include compression stockings (special socks that squeeze the legs to help blood flow), elevating the legs, weight control, and medical procedures on damaged veins (surgical intervention, meaning operations or procedures). Exercise may help by strengthening the calf muscles and improving ankle movement. When we walk or point our toes, the calf muscles squeeze the leg veins. This action, called the calf muscle pump, helps push blood up toward the heart. Exercise programmes can be done at home or with supervision.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether structured physical exercise programmes helped people with non-ulcerated CVI compared with no structured exercise. We looked for benefits and harms. We focused on:\n- leg symptoms and signs;\n- everyday wellbeing (quality of life; how someone feels and functions day to day);\n- how well veins pump out blood (ejection fraction of the calf muscle pump, meaning how much blood the calf muscles push out);\n- how quickly veins refill after movement (venous refilling time; the time it takes for leg veins to fill again after being emptied);\n- the chance of later developing a leg ulcer;\n- walking distance or time, overall fitness, leg muscle strength, ankle movement;\n- the need for procedures and any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registers (lists of planned and completed clinical trials) for trials that compared structured exercise programmes with no structured exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI. We summarized results on symptoms, vein function, quality of life, and related outcomes. We could not combine results because studies used different measures. We rated our confidence in the evidence using a standard system (GRADE, a system that shows how trustworthy evidence is).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 randomized trials involving 146 adults with non-ulcerated CVI. The trials compared structured exercise with no structured exercise. Exercise programmes differed across trials. Follow-up (how long people were observed) ranged from about 8 weeks to 6 months. Overall, the results are uncertain. We do not know whether exercise improves leg symptoms and signs, vein pumping, vein refill time, quality of life, walking distance or time, leg muscle strength, or ankle movement. None of the trials reported whether exercise changed the chance of developing a leg ulcer. Trials did not report unwanted effects.\n\nHow sure are we about these results?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. The trials were small, and people may have known which treatment they received (no blinding, meaning participants or staff knew the treatment). Not all trials reported all outcomes we wanted. These factors make the results uncertain.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe cannot say if structured exercise helps people with CVI who do not have ulcers. Patients may still choose exercise to improve general fitness or leg strength, but we lack strong evidence that it reduces CVI symptoms or prevents ulcers.\n\nWhat is needed next?\nWe need larger, high-quality randomized trials that use the same exercise programmes, follow people for longer, and measure outcomes that matter to patients, including symptom relief, everyday function, development of leg ulcers, and unwanted effects.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
