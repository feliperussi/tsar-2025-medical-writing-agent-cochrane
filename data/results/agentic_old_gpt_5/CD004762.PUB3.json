  "text": "Title: Do medicines help with myotonia (a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing after they contract, causing stiffness, delayed release of grip, cramps, or pain), and what side effects do they cause?\n\nKey messages:\n- Some medicines can help, but benefits and harms differ by condition. In non-dystrophic myotonia (a group of inherited muscle conditions where delayed relaxation is the main problem without progressive muscle wasting), mexiletine (a heart rhythm medicine that blocks sodium channels to calm overactive electrical signals) probably reduces everyday stiffness. Lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant or anti-seizure medicine) may help muscles relax faster and may improve how people feel.\n- In myotonic dystrophy (an inherited disorder that causes myotonia and progressive muscle weakness and can affect the heart with abnormal rhythms and the eyes with cataracts), evidence is limited. Mexiletine may shorten how long the hand stays stiff after gripping, but it is unclear if it improves how people feel and function (quality of life: how someone feels and functions day to day).\n- Not everyone benefits. Reported unwanted effects (adverse events: unwanted events that cause harm) included stomach and gut problems (gastrointestinal: affects the mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines), tiredness or sleepiness (fatigue), headache, and, with lamotrigine, skin rash (an area of skin that may be red, itchy, or irritated).\n\nWhat is myotonia and why does it matter?\nWe studied myotonia (a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing after they contract, causing stiffness and delayed release of grip). It can cause cramps, pain, a feeling that joints are stuck, and tiredness. These problems make everyday tasks slow or hard, such as opening the hand after gripping, standing up, or climbing stairs. Myotonia occurs in:\n- non-dystrophic myotonia (a group of inherited muscle channelopathies: disorders caused by faulty ion channels in muscle cells that disrupt electrical signals), and\n- myotonic dystrophy (an inherited disorder that also causes progressive muscle weakness and can affect the heart with arrhythmias: abnormal heart rhythms, and the eyes with cataracts: clouding of the eye).\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for myotonia?\nWe use medicines to reduce stiffness and help muscles relax. These include:\n- sodium channel blockers (medicines that block sodium channels in nerves or muscles to calm overactive electrical signals), for example mexiletine (a heart rhythm medicine);\n- anticonvulsants or anti-seizure medicines, for example lamotrigine;\n- tricyclic antidepressants (an older class of antidepressants that can help nerve pain);\n- benzodiazepines (medicines that calm the nervous system and relax muscles);\n- calcium channel blockers (medicines that block calcium channels and can affect muscle activity);\n- taurine (a natural compound sometimes taken as a supplement);\n- prednisone (a steroid that reduces inflammation).\nOther medicines tested in small trials include phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin), imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam (Valium), and quinine. No randomized trials tested acetazolamide, flecainide, ranolazine, or lacosamide.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether medicines reduce myotonia symptoms and whether they are safe. We focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies that assign people randomly to 2 or more treatment groups to compare results). We looked mainly at patient-reported outcomes (whether people said their myotonia improved), plus clinical tests and electromyography (EMG: a test that records the electrical activity of muscles). We also looked at side effects and quality of life.\n\nHow did we study this?\nWe searched medical databases and other sources for randomized trials comparing medicines with placebo (a dummy treatment that looks like the real drug). We combined results where appropriate. We rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (a system to rate how sure we are about evidence and how strong recommendations should be).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 randomized trials with 392 people: 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (the most common form) and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. Seven trials were new in this update. Most trials tested mexiletine or lamotrigine versus placebo. Several small trials tested other medicines.\n- In non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces patient-reported stiffness and other symptoms. It probably makes little to no difference in simple eye-closing or basic hand relaxation tests but improves some hand-grip measures and EMG signs of myotonia (patterns where the muscle keeps firing after it should relax). It may improve quality of life.\n- In myotonic dystrophy type 1, mexiletine probably shortens how long the hand stays stiff after gripping slightly. It may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n- Lamotrigine may reduce relaxation time in non-dystrophic myotonia and probably improves quality of life.\n- Both mexiletine and lamotrigine probably increase unwanted effects such as stomach upset (gastrointestinal symptoms), tiredness or sleepiness (fatigue), and headache. Lamotrigine may also cause rash.\n- For other medicines tested in small trials, evidence is unclear.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\nMost studies were small and included few people. Some used cross-over trial designs (where each person receives more than one treatment at different times). Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. Participants or staff may have known which treatment was given in some trials. These issues lower our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nWe need larger and longer randomized trials that focus on patient-reported outcomes, monitor long-term safety, compare medicines directly, and identify who is most likely to benefit. Trials should use methods that make reliable research possible in rare diseases.\n\nCurrency statement\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence up to March 2023.",
