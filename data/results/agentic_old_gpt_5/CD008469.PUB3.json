  "text": "Title: Is teaching about asthma (a long-term lung condition that makes the airways narrow and inflamed) at home better than usual care or teaching elsewhere for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages\n- We found not enough good-quality evidence from randomised trials (research in which participants are randomly assigned by chance to different treatments to compare them) to show that face-to-face home-based education (a trained educator visiting the family at home to teach about asthma and how to manage it) is better than usual care (the care a provider would normally give) or similar education delivered elsewhere (for example, in a clinic or school). We saw little to no clear difference for emergency department visits (the hospital department that gives urgent care) or for needing a short course of oral corticosteroids (steroid tablets or liquid given by mouth to treat bad asthma attacks).\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), but we are very uncertain. We did not find reports of unwanted or harmful effects (negative outcomes or harms). More intensive home visits might reduce hospital admissions (being admitted to stay in hospital for treatment), but the evidence varied and was uncertain.\n\nWhat is childhood asthma and why does it matter?\nAsthma (a long-term condition in which the breathing tubes to the lungs become narrow and swollen, causing wheeze, cough, chest tightness, or shortness of breath) affects many children and teenagers. It can disturb sleep, limit play and sports, and cause missed school days. Usual treatment includes daily preventer inhalers (inhalers that reduce airway inflammation) and reliever inhalers (inhalers that ease symptoms). Good care also includes learning self-management (education and support to help families manage asthma day to day), such as avoiding triggers (things that bring on symptoms, like pollen or smoke) and using inhalers correctly.\n\nWhat is home-based asthma education?\nHome-based education means a trained educator visits the family at home to teach the child and/or their caregiver (a parent or person who looks after someone with a health condition). The educator may explain asthma, review how to avoid triggers, check inhaler technique (how to use an inhaler, a device that gives medicine as a spray to breathe in), and help set up a written asthma action plan. This approach may be more convenient and can help families who have trouble getting to clinic visits.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether home-based education improves outcomes compared with usual care or the same education provided in other places (clinic, hospital, or school). We also asked if more-intensive home programmes (more or longer visits) work better than less-intensive ones (fewer or shorter visits). We looked at outcomes such as flare-ups or exacerbations (times when asthma suddenly gets worse), emergency department visits, courses of oral corticosteroids, hospital admissions, symptom-free days (days with no asthma symptoms), days missed from school, and quality of life.\n\nHow we did the review\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries (to October 2022) for randomised trials. We combined results where possible in pooled analyses (meta-analysis, a method that combines results from several studies) and rated how certain we are about the evidence. We judged certainty using established methods such as GRADE (a system that rates how certain the research evidence is and how strong recommendations should be).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 26 randomised trials with 5,122 children and adolescents. Sixteen trials with 3,668 participants provided data we could pool. The education programmes varied widely in content, number, length, and frequency of sessions. Comparisons were with usual care, a waiting list control (a comparison group that did not receive the programme during the study but was scheduled to receive it later), or less-intensive education either at home or elsewhere. Most outcomes were measured around 6 months.\n\nCompared with usual care or education elsewhere, home-based education probably makes little to no difference to emergency department visits or to the need for oral corticosteroids. It may improve quality of life, but we are very uncertain. We are also very uncertain about effects on symptom-free days, days missed from school, and hospital admissions.\n\nWhen more-intensive home education was compared with less-intensive home education, it may make little to no difference to emergency visits or to oral corticosteroids. More-intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but the results varied and were uncertain. We are very uncertain about effects on quality of life and on symptom-free days.\n\nHow sure are we?\nOverall, our certainty in the evidence ranged from low to very low. Many trials were open (participants or staff knew which group they were in, which can change care or behaviour and affect results — this is called performance bias). The interventions and the people in the studies varied. Many results were imprecise. These issues reduce our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture trials should use the same agreed outcomes (standard measures), follow participants for longer, compare home education with the same content delivered elsewhere, report harms and costs (how much the programme uses in money and resources), and test which parts of a programme matter most.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence up to October 2022.",
