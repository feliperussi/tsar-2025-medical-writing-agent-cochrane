(Infant formula: a manufactured milk substitute for babies when breast milk is not available.)\n- Growth in the first year and later rates of overweight (weighing more than is healthy for height) or obesity (a more severe excess of body fat) looked similar across formula types. Unwanted effects (adverse events: harmful or unwanted effects such as diarrhea or vomiting) were also similar. No study reported deaths from any cause (all-cause mortality: deaths from any reason during the study).\n- The evidence is mostly from high-income countries, varies in how formulas and outcomes were measured, and is uncertain for longer-term outcomes. We need larger, better studies that report harms clearly and follow children longer.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We asked whether healthy, formula-fed, term infants (term infant: a baby born between 37 and 42 completed weeks of pregnancy) who received higher-protein formula did better or worse for growth and later weight than those who received lower-protein formula. We looked at poor growth in the first year (underweight, stunting, wasting) and at later overweight or obesity. We also looked for unwanted effects such as tummy upsets and milk reactions. We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies where participants are assigned by chance to different groups) to get fair comparisons.\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched databases, trial registries, and conference records up to October 2022. We included randomized trials that compared higher- with lower-protein formulas in healthy, term infants who used formula for at least 3 months. We combined and summarized results for growth in the first year, later overweight/obesity, and side effects. We rated our confidence using the GRADE system (a way to say if evidence is very low, low, moderate, or high confidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 11 randomized trials in high-income countries with 1,185 healthy, term, formula-fed infants. Some children were followed up to 11 years. No trial reported deaths (all-cause mortality).\n- Higher-protein formula in these studies meant formulas with 2.5 g or more protein per 100 kilocalories (kcal: a unit of food energy). Standard-protein formulas had protein in the usual middle range. Low-protein formulas had under about 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive formula feeding (exclusive formula feeding: only formula, no breast milk) or under 1.7 g per 100 kcal when formula was used alongside other foods (complementary feeding: formula or foods added while continuing breast milk). (Grams per 100 kcal: shows how concentrated a nutrient is in a food.)\n- Compared with standard-protein formula, higher-protein formula may make little or no difference to growth in the first year. This includes measures such as weight-for-age, height-for-age, or weight-for-height (ways to compare a child’s growth to a reference group). It may also make little or no difference to unwanted effects like diarrhea (frequent loose or watery stools), vomiting (being sick), or milk allergy. One study that followed children to about age 5 suggested little or no difference in rates of overweight or obesity, but we are very uncertain about that result.\n- Compared with low-protein formula, standard-protein formula may make little or no difference to growth in the first year. It may also make little or no difference to unwanted effects in the first 4 months. No trials in this comparison reported later overweight or obesity.\n- For most outcomes we rated the evidence as low or very low confidence. That means we are unsure about the results.\n\nWhat are the main limits of the evidence?\n- The trials used different formulas and measured outcomes in different ways. Most trials were done in high-income countries, so results may not apply everywhere. Few trials were large or long enough to give clear answers about later outcomes such as overweight or obesity. Most studies did not measure body composition (the balance of fat and muscle).\n\nWhat does this mean for parents and clinicians?\n- Current evidence does not clearly favour higher- or lower-protein formula for healthy, term infants. We need larger, well-designed trials that:\n- directly compare protein levels in formula,\n- report unwanted effects (adverse events) clearly,\n- measure body composition, and\n- follow children for longer to see later weight outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n- The evidence search is up to date to October 2022.",
