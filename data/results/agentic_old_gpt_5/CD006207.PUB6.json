  "text": "Do masks, handwashing, and other everyday measures help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses (like flu and COVID-19)?\n\nKey messages\n- We think hand hygiene (hand washing or using hand sanitiser) probably gives a small reduction in general respiratory illness (sudden infections of the nose, throat, airways, or lungs that cause coughs, colds, or fever).\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence that medical/surgical masks (disposable, loose-fitting masks that cover the nose and mouth) in the community clearly reduce influenza (flu)‑like illness (fever with cough or sore throat) or laboratory-confirmed infection (proven by a lab test). N95/P2 respirators (tight-fitting masks that filter very small particles) probably make little to no difference compared with medical/surgical masks for lab-confirmed infection in routine care. Unwanted effects (adverse events; harms such as discomfort or skin irritation) were rarely measured.\n- Most trials took place outside major outbreaks (pandemics, which are outbreaks that spread across many countries). Many people did not follow the assigned measures (adherence; following the study directions). This adds uncertainty and shows we need more large, well-designed trials in different settings and groups.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We asked whether simple, everyday physical measures (non-drug actions) can stop or lower the spread of acute respiratory infections (ARIs — sudden infections of the breathing passages such as colds, flu, or COVID-19). We looked for effects on respiratory illness and on laboratory-confirmed infection (proven by a lab test). We also wanted to know about unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nHow did we do the review?\n- We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned by chance to different groups) and cluster-randomized trials (where whole groups, such as schools or clinics, are assigned by chance). We combined results across studies and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 78 randomized and cluster-randomized trials. This update added 11 new trials with 610,872 participants. Six of the new trials took place during the COVID-19 pandemic (an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus).\n- Studies ran in many settings: schools, childcare, households, crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries, an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country, and hospital wards. Participants included community members and healthcare workers (people who provide care to patients). One new large trial enrolled 1,009 healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients across 4 countries.\n- We found trials that compared medical/surgical masks with no masks, N95/P2 respirators with medical/surgical masks, and hand hygiene with no added hand hygiene. We found no randomized trials on gowns and gloves, face shields (clear plastic visors worn over the face), or screening at entry ports (checking travellers at airports or borders).\n- Overall, wearing medical/surgical masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to flu-like illness or to laboratory-confirmed infections based on the current trials. Compared with medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators probably make little to no difference for laboratory-confirmed infection, may reduce flu-like illness, and have uncertain effects on general respiratory symptoms. Hand hygiene probably reduces general respiratory illness a little, but may make little to no difference to flu-like illness or lab-confirmed infection. Reports of unwanted effects were rare and poorly measured.\n\nHow sure are we?\n- We rated the evidence as low to moderate certainty. Many trials had low adherence (people did not follow the measures). The risk of bias (flaws in how studies were designed, done, or analysed) was often high or unclear. Studies used different methods and took place in different people and settings. These issues increase uncertainty.\n\nWhat does this mean for people and policy?\n- Hand washing likely helps a little to lower common respiratory illness. Current trials suggest masks, whether medical/surgical or N95/P2 respirators, probably change outcomes little in routine community settings. We need more large, well-designed trials that measure how well people follow measures, report unwanted effects, compare medical/surgical masks with N95/P2 respirators, and test measures not yet evaluated such as gowns and gloves, face shields, and screening at entry ports.\n\nLimitations\n- Many trials were done outside pandemic periods. People often knew which group they were in, which may affect results. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. These limits reduce our confidence in the findings.\n\nCurrency\n- This review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to October 2022.",
