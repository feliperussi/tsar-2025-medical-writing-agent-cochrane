  "text": "Does lowering blood pressure help prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy (a type of diabetic eye disease; damage to the small blood vessels in the retina that can cause vision loss)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found 29 randomized trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatments) that included 27,185 people. Over about 5 years, more intensive blood pressure control (aiming for lower-than-usual blood pressure targets using medicines and close monitoring) probably slightly reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy (damage to the small blood vessels in the retina).\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence that lowering blood pressure slows progression (getting worse over time) once retinopathy is already present. We also did not find clear evidence that it reduces serious eye problems such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (an advanced form with fragile new blood vessels that can bleed and cause vision loss), macular edema (swelling of the central part of the retina that can blur vision), vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding into the clear gel inside the eye), or loss of visual acuity (how clearly a person sees). Reported harms included more episodes of hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); deaths were similar between groups.\n- People with type 2 diabetes (a condition where the body does not use insulin well) who already had hypertension (high blood pressure; often defined as 140/90 or higher) seemed to benefit more than people with normal blood pressure (normotension; normal blood pressure). Evidence in people with type 1 diabetes (a condition where the body makes little or no insulin and needs insulin treatment) was limited. Few trials reported quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) or costs.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is an eye disease caused by diabetes (a condition with high blood glucose, or blood sugar). High blood glucose over time harms tiny blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. This damage can lead to vision problems and is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. Early stages may not cause symptoms. We recommend regular eye checks. When vision is threatened, treatments can include laser therapy, injections into the eye, and surgery.\n\nHow could controlling blood pressure help protect sight in people with diabetes?\nBlood pressure is the force of blood on the inside walls of blood vessels. High blood pressure (hypertension; often 140/90 or higher) can strain and damage small blood vessels throughout the body, including those in the retina. Many people with diabetes also have hypertension. Lowering blood pressure with lifestyle changes and antihypertensive drugs (medicines that lower blood pressure) might help prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy. Some studies tested intensive blood pressure control (stricter targets) versus usual care (the care a provider would normally give).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether actively controlling blood pressure in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, whether they had normotension (normal blood pressure) or hypertension (high blood pressure), helps to:\n- prevent diabetic retinopathy from developing;\n- slow its progression (getting worse over time);\n- preserve vision (visual acuity, or how clearly a person sees);\n- reduce serious eye complications.\nWe also looked for unwanted effects (adverse events; harms), effects on quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), and costs.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched research databases and trial registries (public online lists of clinical studies) for randomized trials (studies that assign people by chance) that compared tighter blood-pressure control with standard care, placebo (an inactive treatment that looks like the real one), or different blood-pressure medicines. We combined results for new cases (incidence), progression, vision, serious eye problems, harms, quality of life, and costs. We rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 29 randomized trials with 27,185 people. Trials came from many countries. Follow-up ranged from under 1 year to 9 years, with many key results at about 5 years. Funding sources varied. Overall:\n- Intensive blood pressure control probably slightly reduced the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over about 5 years.\n- It may slightly reduce the combined chance of developing or worsening retinopathy.\n- It probably makes little to no difference to progression once retinopathy exists.\n- It may make little to no difference to serious eye complications, and we do not know if it affects noticeable loss of vision.\n- People with type 2 diabetes and hypertension seemed to benefit more.\n- For safety, intensive control probably slightly reduced deaths but increased symptoms of low blood pressure (hypotension) such as dizziness or fainting.\n\nHow certain are we?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Studies included different kinds of people and used different treatments and targets. Many outcomes and subgroups were not well covered. There were not enough studies to be certain about some results.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture trials should follow people for longer. They should report outcomes that matter to patients (vision, daily functioning, harms such as hypotension, and costs). They should directly compare different blood-pressure medicines and different blood pressure targets. Trials should clarify effects in people with normotension and in those with type 1 diabetes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.",
