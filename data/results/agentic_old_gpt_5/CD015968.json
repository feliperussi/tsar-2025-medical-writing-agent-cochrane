  "text": "Title\nDo digital health tools (health support via phones, computers, or other devices, such as apps, fitness trackers, texts, active video games, or telehealth visits) help children and teenagers with obesity when used alone or with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on small, mostly short-term randomized controlled trials (a study where people are randomly put into groups to fairly test what works), adding digital health (use of digital technologies such as apps, wearables, text messaging, or telehealth) to conventional care (the usual face-to-face healthcare such as advice on eating and physical activity) probably leads to a small short-term drop in body fat (adiposity: the amount of fat in the body) compared with conventional care alone. We are moderately confident in this finding, but more research could change it.\n- It is unclear whether adding digital tools helps weight, body mass index (BMI: a measure of weight for height), physical activity (any body movement that uses energy), blood pressure (the force of blood on artery walls), well-being, or quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). No study reported adverse events (unwanted harms or side effects), so we do not know if digital tools cause harm.\n- When digital tools were used on their own, without conventional care, their effects were unclear. Most studies enrolled adolescents (ages 10 to 19), so we do not know if the results apply to younger children.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem?\nObesity is a long-term disease marked by too much body fat (adiposity). Researchers often use BMI (a number based on height and weight) to identify obesity in young people. Childhood obesity is common worldwide and raises the chance (risk) of problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep problems, joint pain, and liver disease. It can also hurt mental health and daily life (quality of life). Many young people with obesity stay overweight into adulthood. Early, effective care matters.\n\nWhat care do young people usually receive, and what is 'digital health'?\nUsual care (conventional care) often gives advice on diet (what a person eats and drinks), helps increase physical activity (any body movement that uses energy), and supports habit change. Care can come from clinics, schools, or community programs and often involves families. Digital health means using technology to support health goals. Examples include:\n- wearables (small devices worn on the body that track steps, heart rate, or activity);\n- mobile apps (health programs on phones or tablets) and text messages;\n- web-based programs (health programs on websites);\n- exergaming or active video games (video games that make you move);\n- telehealth (health care by phone or video).\nThese tools can be added to usual care or used on their own.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked whether digital health tools help children and adolescents with obesity and whether they are safe. We compared digital tools plus usual care versus usual care alone, and digital tools alone versus usual care alone. We looked for changes in body fat, weight or BMI, physical activity, blood pressure, well-being, quality of life, and any unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched multiple databases and trial registers up to April 2025. We included randomized controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups). We combined results when suitable. We judged how certain the evidence was by looking at study methods, size, and consistency. We also considered bias (flaws in study design or conduct that can favor one result).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 15 randomized controlled trials with 911 children and adolescents with obesity. Studies came from the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. All trials included adolescents (ages 10 to 19); 5 also included younger children. Interventions used wearables, web programs, texts, mobile apps, active video games, and telehealth. Programs varied: 8 combined diet and physical activity, 4 targeted activity only, and 3 targeted diet only. Nine studies lasted under 6 months and 6 lasted 6 months or longer. Many trials did not report the behavior change theory (scientific ideas about how to design programs that change habits) behind the program.\n\nMain results\n- Adding a digital tool to usual care probably reduces body fat slightly in the short term. We are moderately confident in this result.\n- It is unclear whether adding a digital tool improves other outcomes such as weight, BMI, physical activity, well-being, or quality of life.\n- When digital tools were used on their own, their effects were unclear.\n- No studies reported adverse events, so we do not know about harms.\n- We do not know whether any benefits last over time.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nMost studies were small and often short. Many did not report all key data or the behavior change theory that guided the program. People in studies may have known which treatment they received, which can affect results. These issues lower our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat does this mean for research and practice?\nWe need larger, longer trials. Future studies should:\n- report adverse events (unwanted harms or side effects);\n- measure outcomes that matter to children and families, such as weight, physical activity, and quality of life;\n- report results by age, sex, and race or ethnicity (race: groups with shared physical traits; ethnicity: social and cultural background);\n- clearly describe how diet and physical activity were managed with the digital tools.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to April 2025.",
