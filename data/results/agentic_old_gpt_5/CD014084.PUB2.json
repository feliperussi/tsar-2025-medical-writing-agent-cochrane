  "text": "Is adding sinus surgery to medicines better than medicines alone for people with cystic fibrosis (a hereditary disease in which glands make thick, sticky mucus) who have nasal polyps (soft, non-cancerous growths inside the nose)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found too little good-quality evidence to know whether adding sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery: a minimally invasive operation using a thin, lighted camera and small tools through the nostrils to open blocked sinus passages and remove polyps) to medical treatment is better than medical treatment alone for people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We do not know if surgery improves nose symptoms, breathing tests (pulmonary function: how well the lungs work), reduces germs in the nose and sinuses (bacterial colonization: when bacteria live and grow there), lowers the need for antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria), or prevents lung flare-ups (pulmonary exacerbations: sudden worsening of lung symptoms that often need extra treatment).\n- Unwanted effects were rarely reported. One person had bleeding during surgery; this was controlled without lasting problems. The study did not report effects on survival (death rates).\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how can it affect the nose and sinuses?\nWe looked at people with cystic fibrosis (a hereditary disease in which glands make thick, sticky mucus). That mucus can block small drainage passages in the nose and the air pockets in the bones around the nose (sinuses: air pockets that link to the nose). When these passages stay blocked, people can get long-lasting inflammation of the nose and sinuses (chronic rhinosinusitis: long-lasting swelling and irritation of the nose and sinuses) and nasal polyps (soft, non-cancerous growths inside the nose). These problems can cause a blocked or runny nose, face pressure, less sense of smell, and repeated infections. Because cystic fibrosis affects the lungs, sinus problems may link with breathing symptoms and overall health.\n\nWhat treatments are used for nasal polyps and sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe describe two main approaches. Non-surgical care aims to reduce swelling, clear mucus, and treat infection. This includes salt-water rinses (nasal irrigation: rinsing the nose and sinuses with salt water to wash out thick mucus and germs) and medicines. Some people have endoscopic sinus surgery (endoscopic: using a thin, lighted camera tube through the nose; polypectomy: surgery to remove a polyp). The single trial we found used endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy (sinusotomy: surgical opening of the sinus drainage pathways; extended sinusotomy: making a wider opening to improve drainage). Surgery aims to open the sinus passages and remove polyps so the sinuses drain better and other treatments work more effectively.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared endoscopic sinus surgery (alone or with other treatments) with non-surgical care alone for people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We wanted to know if adding surgery helps nose and sinus symptoms, how well the lungs work (pulmonary function), how often people need antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria), how often they go into hospital (hospitalization: care that usually needs at least one overnight stay), and how often they have lung flare-ups (pulmonary exacerbations).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registers (organized lists of study information) for studies that compared endoscopic sinus surgery with non-surgical care. We summarized results for nose/sinus symptoms, lung function, hospital use, antibiotic use, and lung flare-ups. We rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 1 small randomized study (randomization: assigning people to treatments by chance) with 28 adults aged 19 to 28. People were assigned to nasal irrigation (salt-water rinses) alone or nasal irrigation plus endoscopic sinus surgery (endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy). Because this evidence comes from a single, small trial with limited reporting, we are very uncertain whether adding surgery helps with nose symptoms, changes germs in the nose and sinuses (bacterial colonization), reduces the need for antibiotics, reduces lung flare-ups, or improves lung function. One bleeding event happened during surgery and was controlled without further problems. The study did not report survival (death rates) or provide much information on other outcomes, such as hospital use.\n\nHow certain are we about the evidence?\nWe are not confident. There are too few studies to be sure. People in the study may have known which treatment they received. Not all outcomes were reported.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with cystic fibrosis?\nWe do not know if adding endoscopic sinus surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. Doctors and patients should discuss treatment choices and the limits of the evidence.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture studies should be larger, include children and adults, follow people for longer, use clear and objective outcomes (for example, changes in nose symptoms, lung function, infections, and need for antibiotics), report unwanted effects, and consider the effect of newer cystic fibrosis medicines called CFTR modulators (medicines that help the faulty CFTR protein work better).\n\nCurrency: The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
