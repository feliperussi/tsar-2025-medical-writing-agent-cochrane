  "text": "Title: Do antibiotics given before or during surgical treatment for miscarriage (removing pregnancy tissue from the womb) help prevent infection?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving antibiotics before or during surgical treatment for miscarriage (prophylactic antibiotics — antibiotics given to prevent infection; uterine evacuation — removing pregnancy tissue from the womb) may reduce infection of the womb (uterine infection — the invasion and growth of germs in the womb). The most reliable trials showed a reduction, but not all studies were high quality and some people did not take the study medicines or were not checked after treatment (follow-up — checking on people after treatment).\n- Unwanted effects (adverse effects — unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment) were poorly reported. The largest trial found similar rates of vomiting (being sick) and diarrhoea (frequent, loose bowel movements) with and without antibiotics. Allergic reactions (allergy — a reaction that can cause rash, itching, or breathing problems) were possible but seemed rare. No serious, life‑threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis — serious, potentially life‑threatening allergic reaction) was reported.\n- We are uncertain whether routine antibiotics lower the later need for antibiotics or the chance of hospital admission (hospitalisation — being admitted to the hospital for treatment). More large, well‑designed trials are needed that use clear ways to diagnose infection, keep good follow-up, and fully report unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and how is it managed?\nEarly pregnancy loss (miscarriage — an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week) happens when a pregnancy ends on its own in the early months. After a miscarriage, some pregnancy tissue (a group of cells left in the uterus) can stay in the womb (uterus — the hollow, pear‑shaped organ where a fetus grows). Doctors may wait to see if the tissue passes, give medicines, or perform a uterine evacuation (removing pregnancy tissue from the womb). In the studies we found, this was surgical uterine evacuation (removal of pregnancy tissue using medical instruments in a clinic or hospital). Any procedure carries a small risk of uterine infection.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be given before a uterine evacuation?\nAntibiotics are medicines that treat infections caused by bacteria. Prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given to prevent infection) might lower the chance of a uterine infection after the procedure. But antibiotics can cause side effects and may add to antibiotic resistance (when bacteria no longer respond well to antibiotics). People who already have signs of infection clearly need antibiotics; this review looked only at people without signs of infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether routinely giving prophylactic antibiotics to people having a uterine evacuation after miscarriage, who do not have signs of infection, reduces uterine infection. We also wanted to know if routine antibiotics reduce later need for antibiotics, reduce hospitalisation, or cause unwanted effects such as vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergy. The trials compared antibiotics with no antibiotics or with a placebo (placebo — a dummy treatment that does not contain medicine).\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (a study where participants are randomly assigned to get the treatment or a comparison) that compared routine prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in people having surgical uterine evacuation after early pregnancy loss. We combined results when possible and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 randomized controlled trials with 4,371 people who had surgical uterine evacuation. All had no signs of infection. All trials looked at surgical (procedural) management; none looked at medical or expectant management. Only 1 study reported side effects in detail.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n- The better‑quality trials showed that antibiotics given before the procedure reduced uterine infection. When we combined all trials, antibiotics may reduce infection, but the overall certainty is lower.\n- Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to vomiting or diarrhoea. They may increase allergy, but serious allergy (anaphylaxis) was not reported.\n- It is unclear whether routine antibiotics lower the later need for antibiotics or hospitalisation.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because some studies may have been biased (bias — flaws in study design or conduct). Some people did not follow the study medicines, and follow-up was incomplete. The trials used different methods and included different patient groups. There are not enough high‑quality trials to be certain.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to October 2023.",
