  "text": "Title\nHow accurate are toe blood pressure tests (toe‑brachial index: comparison of toe and arm blood pressure, and toe systolic blood pressure: blood pressure at the toe) for detecting peripheral artery disease (narrowed leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not know how accurate the toe–brachial index (TBI) (a ratio comparing blood pressure at the toe to blood pressure in the arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) (the top, or systolic, blood pressure measured at the toe using a small cuff and sensor) are for finding peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (a condition where arteries to the legs become narrowed or blocked, reducing blood flow and causing leg pain, slow-healing wounds, and higher heart and stroke risks). No harms from these tests were reported.\n- We cannot tell if one test is better, which cut‑off value (the chosen number that decides a positive test result) works best, or whether accuracy differs by patient group (for example, people with diabetes, a condition with high blood sugar, or renal disease, diseases of the kidneys), by device, or by the reference standard (the best available method used to decide who really has the disease). The studies were few, small, and often poorly reported.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease and why does early diagnosis matter?\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is when arteries that carry blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by fatty build‑up. This lowers blood flow. Typical problems include claudication (cramping or aching in the legs when walking), rest pain (ongoing foot or toe pain when not moving), slow‑healing wounds, gangrene (death of body tissue), and sometimes amputation (surgical removal of a limb). People with PAD also have a higher chance of heart attack and stroke. Early diagnosis lets us start treatments that lower risk and ease symptoms.\n\nWhat are the TBI and TSBP tests?\nTSBP measures the systolic (top) blood pressure at a toe using a small cuff and sensor (a sphygmomanometer is the cuff and gauge used to measure blood pressure). TBI divides the toe pressure by the arm (brachial) pressure to give a simple ratio. Both tests are non‑invasive (no needles or surgery) and take minutes at the bedside or clinic. Measuring at the toes helps because ankle arteries can be stiff in people with diabetes or renal disease, which can give false ankle readings. Toe arteries are less affected.\n\nHow do researchers check these tests?\nResearchers compare TBI and TSBP with a reference standard (the best available method to decide who really has the disease). Common reference standards were:\n- colour duplex ultrasound (a scan using sound waves that makes pictures of blood vessels and shows colour blood flow),\n- computed tomography angiography or CTA (x‑ray pictures of blood vessels after a dye injection),\n- multi‑detector row CT (an advanced CT scanner that quickly makes thin images),\n- conventional angiography (x‑ray of blood vessels using dye).\nThe toe tests used different devices, such as photoplethysmography (a light sensor that detects small changes in blood volume in the skin), laser Doppler (a low‑power laser that estimates small‑vessel blood flow), and continuous‑wave Doppler (an ultrasound probe that detects blood flow signals). Diagnostic test accuracy means how well a test finds people with and without the disease.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well TBI and TSBP detect PAD in adults at risk. We also wanted to see if different cut‑off values change accuracy, if one test is better, and if accuracy varies by patient group, device, or reference standard.\n\nHow we did the review\nWe searched databases and trial registers up to February 2024 for adult studies that measured TSBP or TBI and used imaging to confirm PAD. We combined results when we could and judged study quality and our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (a system for rating how trustworthy evidence is).\n\nWhat we found\nWe included 18 studies. Thirteen studied TBI only, 1 studied TSBP only, and 4 studied both. TBI was measured in 1,927 people (2,550 limbs). TSBP was measured in 701 people (701 limbs). Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as the reference standard. Studies used many different devices. Most studies were small and poorly reported.\n\nWhat this means\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low. We are uncertain how accurate TBI or TSBP are for finding PAD. We cannot say one test is better. We cannot recommend specific cut‑off values. We also found little information on harms or costs.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture studies should:\n- Compare TBI and TSBP directly in the same people.\n- Use reliable imaging as the reference standard and agree cut‑off values before testing.\n- Include people with diabetes and renal disease and other relevant groups.\n- Use clear, consistent methods and report harms and costs.\n\nLimitations\nWe had low confidence because studies were often small, varied in patients and methods, and were poorly described. Some studies lacked key data.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
