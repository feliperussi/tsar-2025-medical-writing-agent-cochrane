  "text": "Title\nHow do healthcare workers use their own mobile phones and tablets for work, and what are the benefits and downsides?\n\nKey messages\n- Healthcare workers often use their own phones and tablets in unregulated ways (not controlled by official workplace rules or policies). This helps care become faster, more personal and more responsive. It also helps patients reach a specific worker and can strengthen relationships among staff and with communities.\n- Informal device use brings harms. It can cost staff money for calls, airtime (prepaid credit used to make calls, send messages, or access the internet) and data (information collected from or about people taking part in a research study). It can push staff to be available out-of-hours (times outside normal working hours, such as evenings, nights, weekends). It can risk confidentiality (protecting personal information from people who should not have access) and create shadow IT (unofficial technology and data practices used outside an organization’s approved systems). It can also increase inequities (unfair and avoidable differences in pay, resources, treatment, or opportunities) between staff and between patients.\n- We need research to test ways to keep useful parts of informal device use while protecting privacy, keeping records in formal health systems (official, organized healthcare services and information systems), lowering costs for staff, and making care fairer.\n\nWhat are informal uses of mobile phones by healthcare workers?\nWe use \"informal use\" to mean staff use personal devices for work but their workplace has not approved or paid for them. Examples include a nurse calling a colleague for advice, messaging a patient about an appointment, taking a photo of a wound with consent, or looking up clinical guidance online. Informal channels (personal email, WhatsApp, or texting) are common ways this happens. These channels sit outside formal systems and can leave records incomplete.\n\nWhy does this matter for patients and health services?\nInformal use can fill gaps when formal systems are missing, slow, or unreliable. Formal systems include workplace phones, secure messaging apps, or electronic health records. Informal use can make care quicker, more personalised, and more flexible. But it also creates problems:\n- Staff bear costs for airtime and device upkeep and may use personal data (information collected from or about people taking part in a research study) for work.\n- Staff may work outside normal hours and feel pressure to be available out-of-hours (times outside normal working hours).\n- Personal devices can store or share patient details, risking confidentiality (protecting personal information from people who should not have access).\n- Informal channels can create shadow IT (unofficial technology and data practices used outside an organization’s approved systems). Shadow IT weakens formal health systems (official, organized healthcare services and information systems) by moving decisions and records outside approved channels.\n- Unequal access to electricity, internet, or strong personal networks (the colleagues, mentors, and contacts you can reach for advice) can leave some staff and patients worse off. Social hierarchies (ranked levels of status and power among people that influence who has more say or access) can mean lower-paid or less senior workers carry more costs and out-of-hours demands.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals view and use personal mobile devices informally. We asked what drives these practices, how they show up in daily care, and what benefits and risks they bring for patients, staff, and health services. We also looked at effects on teamwork, workload, confidentiality, and the strength of formal systems.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched several bibliographic databases (large searchable online indexes of research articles) from 2008 to August 2022. We included 30 qualitative or mixed-methods studies. \"Qualitative evidence synthesis\" means we brought together findings from many qualitative studies to summarise people’s views and experiences. \"Mixed-methods studies\" combine interviews or observations with surveys or numbers. We organised study findings into themes and judged how much confidence to place in each finding using GRADE-CERQual (a system for judging confidence in qualitative evidence). We rated our overall confidence in the main findings as moderate to high.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Informal use often helps staff be flexible, efficient, and responsive to patients. It enables direct and personal communication with patients and colleagues.\n- Informal use creates costs and pressures for staff. Colleagues and managers may expect staff to use personal devices, adding work outside normal hours and extra expense, especially for lower-paid staff. This can widen inequities (unfair and avoidable differences) in the workforce.\n- Informal use can risk patient privacy and move information outside formal systems. This can weaken records, create shadow IT, and make care uneven across patients and settings.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nThe 30 studies used different methods and covered varied groups and settings. Most studies focused on phones rather than tablets. Participant numbers and funding sources were often not reported. These issues reduce confidence in some details and in how well findings apply everywhere.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nResearch should test ways to strengthen formal systems while keeping useful features of informal use. Possible approaches include better privacy protection, ways to keep records inside official systems, and measures to lower out-of-pocket costs and after-hours burdens for staff. New studies should include different roles, settings, and devices and measure effects on patient care, staff wellbeing, and health system performance.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
