  "text": "Title: Does closing internal gaps (mesenteric defects) during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (a type of weight-loss surgery) reduce the risk of internal hernias (bowel getting trapped inside the belly)?\n\nKey messages\n- Closing mesenteric defects (small holes or gaps in the mesentery, the thin tissue that holds the intestines and their blood vessels) during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; a weight-loss operation that makes a small stomach pouch and connects it to a lower part of the small intestine) may lower the chance of an internal hernia (when intestine slips through an internal gap and can become trapped or blocked). We judged this as low-certainty evidence (we have limited confidence and the true effect may be different).\n- Closing the gaps seems to make little to no difference to overall complications within 30 days after surgery (complications = unwanted health problems). We do not know whether closure changes deaths within 30 days or problems during the operation (intraoperative events). Hospital stay may be slightly longer with closure. Pain at 2 years, quality of life, and costs were not reported.\n\nWhat is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and why can internal hernias happen afterward?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a type of bariatric surgery (surgery to help people who are obese lose weight). The surgeon makes a small stomach pouch and connects it to a lower part of the small intestine. The surgeon also makes new joins in the bowel (anastomoses; surgical connections between two sections of intestine). The surgeon moves the intestine through spaces in the mesentery. These steps can leave mesenteric defects (holes or gaps in the mesentery). Loops of bowel can slip through those gaps. That slipping is an internal hernia (a bulging of the intestine through a gap inside the belly). An internal hernia can cause bowel obstruction (a block in the intestine), with severe pain, vomiting, and need for emergency surgery.\n\nWhy might surgeons close the mesenteric defects?\nSurgeons may close defects with stitches (sutures). Some sutures are non-absorbable (they do not dissolve and stay unless removed). Closure may use interrupted sutures (individual stitches tied one by one) or running sutures (one continuous stitch). Closing may stop internal hernias. But stitches can also narrow or kink the bowel at an anastomosis. That could cause a bowel obstruction. Closure can add time to the operation and might affect recovery, such as hospital stay.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether closing mesenteric defects during RYGB prevents internal hernia compared with leaving them open. We also looked at harms and recovery: complications and deaths within 30 days after surgery, intraoperative problems (events during the operation), length of hospital stay (mean days), and pain at 2 years.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies up to August 2024. We included randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned by chance to different treatments). We combined results across studies and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach (a system that rates how sure we are about evidence from high to very low).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 3 randomized trials with 3,010 adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 35; BMI = body mass index, a measure relating weight to height). Surgery was laparoscopic (keyhole surgery using a camera) or robotic (surgeon controls robotic instruments). Closure used non-absorbable sutures; 1 trial used interrupted sutures and 2 used running sutures. Outcomes were followed up to 10 years.\n- Closing the defects may greatly reduce the chance of internal hernia with bowel blockage within 10 years (low-certainty evidence).\n- Closing the defects may make little to no difference to overall complications within 30 days (low-certainty evidence).\n- We do not know whether closing the defects affects deaths within 30 days or intraoperative problems (very low-certainty evidence).\n- Hospital stay may be slightly longer with closure, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).\n- Pain at 2 years, quality of life, and costs were not reported.\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe have low or very low certainty in the evidence. This means we have limited confidence and the true effect may be different. Reasons include few trials, possible bias (flaws in study design or conduct), and missing information on some outcomes.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and surgeons?\n- Closing mesenteric defects may reduce the long-term chance of a serious internal hernia. But closure may not change short-term complications and may lengthen hospital stay. We lack data on long-term pain, quality of life, and costs.\n- We need more well-designed, adequately sized trials. Trials should compare different closure methods and report harms, recovery, pain, quality of life, and costs.\n\nLimitations\n- Trials did not report participant ages, sexes, or trial funding. People in the trials may have known which treatment they received, which can introduce bias. Not all trials reported all outcomes.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to August 2024.",
