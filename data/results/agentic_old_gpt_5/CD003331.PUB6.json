  "text": "Title: Does exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a structured, heart-safe exercise programme with professional guidance) help adults with heart failure (a long-term condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood, causing breathlessness, tiredness, and swelling) live longer, feel better, and have fewer hospital stays compared with usual care (the care a provider would normally give without a structured exercise programme)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces hospital admissions (being admitted to hospital) and improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (how someone’s health affects their daily life, comfort, and ability to do activities) in the short term (about 6–12 months). We did not find clear evidence it reduces deaths (mortality) over this period (the evidence for death was low certainty).\n- Benefits were similar across delivery methods: centre-based programmes (in a hospital or clinic with supervised exercise), home-based programmes (done at home with a tailored plan and remote support), and digitally supported programmes (using phone or internet tools). Most participants had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (the heart pumps out less blood each beat), so results may not apply to people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (the heart pumps a normal percent but is stiff and does not fill well). Women and older adults were under-represented.\n- Future studies should follow people longer, include more women and older adults, include more people with HFpEF, and report unwanted or harmful effects (injuries or heart problems during exercise) and costs.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a long-term condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood for the body’s needs. People often feel breathless, tired, and have swelling in the legs or abdomen. These symptoms limit daily activities and lower HRQoL (how health affects day-to-day life). Heart failure raises the chance of hospital admission and of death (mortality).\n\nWhat is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation?\nExercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a structured programme that puts planned, regular physical activity at its centre. The programme is heart-safe and tailored to the person. It often includes education and support. Programmes can be centre-based (in clinic), home-based (at home with remote support), or digitally supported (using phone or online tools).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe asked whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, compared with no structured exercise (usual care), helps adults with heart failure to: live longer (reduce mortality), avoid hospital stays (reduce hospital admissions), and feel and function better (improve HRQoL). We also looked at different types of heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) and different programme delivery methods.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments) that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation with no structured exercise. We pooled results from trials that followed people for at least 6 months (the median follow-up was about 6 months). We rated how certain we are in the evidence using the GRADE approach (a system to rate certainty in evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 randomized trials with 8,728 adults. Most people had HFrEF (reduced pumping function). Follow-up was usually 6–12 months. Compared with no structured exercise, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduced all-cause hospital admissions by about 8 fewer people per 100 over about 1 year (from about 24 per 100 to about 16 per 100). It probably slightly reduced admissions for heart failure. It probably improved HRQoL by an amount likely to matter to patients. It may make little to no difference to deaths over this time.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident (moderate-certainty evidence) about reductions in hospital admissions and improvements in HRQoL. We are less confident (low-certainty evidence) about effects on death. Many studies varied in participants and programme delivery. Few deaths were reported, which limits certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\n- Most trials studied people with HFrEF, so evidence for HFpEF is limited.  \n- Women and older adults were under-represented.  \n- Trials reported unwanted or harmful effects (injuries or heart problems during exercise) poorly, so we cannot tell how often these occur.  \n- Studies used different exercise types, amounts (dose), and delivery methods, which adds variation.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nWe think offering exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to adults with heart failure can reduce hospital admissions and improve daily life in the short term. Programmes can be delivered in clinic, at home, or with digital support. Clinicians should consider these options while noting that longer-term effects on survival are unclear. We need longer trials that include more women, older adults, and people with HFpEF, and that report harms and costs clearly.\n\nCurrency: This review updates our previous review.
