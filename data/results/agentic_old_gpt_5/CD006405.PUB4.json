  "text": "Title: Is high-flow oxygen through the nose (high-flow nasal therapy; a breathing support that delivers warmed, humidified air and oxygen through small prongs in the nose at higher flow rates to help a baby breathe without a tube) as good as CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure; a machine that gently pushes air into a baby’s nose at a steady pressure to keep airways open) or NIPPV (nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation; CPAP plus occasional extra pushes of air through the nose to help breaths) for first breathing support in premature babies?\n\nKey messages\n- Among preterm babies (a baby born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), starting with nasal high flow (nHF) seems to give similar chances of survival and avoiding bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; a long-term lung condition in preterm infants who still need oxygen or breathing support weeks after birth) as CPAP or NIPPV. nHF probably increases early treatment failure (when the first breathing support isn’t enough within 72 hours and care must be escalated) compared with CPAP but probably does not increase the need for mechanical ventilation (a ventilator moves air in and out of the lungs through a tube placed in the windpipe) in the first 72 hours. nHF causes less nasal trauma (irritation or injury to the nostrils from devices) and may reduce pneumothorax (an abnormal collection of air around the lung that can cause the lung to collapse).\n- Compared with NIPPV, nHF appears to give similar rates of early treatment failure and similar need for mechanical ventilation within 72 hours, and causes less nasal trauma. The evidence for this comparison is limited and comes from few studies.\n- We need larger, well-designed trials, especially in extremely preterm infants (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), that use consistent device settings, report harms like nasal trauma and pneumothorax clearly, and follow babies longer to assess breathing and development.\n\nWhat breathing problems do babies born early often have?\n- Babies born early (preterm: a baby born before 37 weeks) often have underdeveloped lungs. Many develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; a lung condition in premature babies caused by not having enough surfactant, a slippery substance that coats tiny air sacs and keeps them open). Without support, babies can become low on oxygen and work hard to breathe.\n\nWhat is nasal high flow therapy?\n- Nasal high flow (nHF) gives warmed, humidified gas (air and oxygen that is warmed and moistened to protect the airways) through small nasal prongs (soft tips that sit just inside the nostrils) at higher flow rates (measured in liters per minute). It is non-invasive respiratory support (breathing help given without a breathing tube). Clinicians use nHF as primary respiratory support (the first breathing help given soon after birth) to try to avoid more invasive care.\n\nWhat other treatments help preterm babies breathe?\n- CPAP uses steady pressure through the nose to keep airways open. NIPPV adds occasional extra breaths to CPAP through the nose. If these supports fail, teams may use intubation (placing a tube into the windpipe) to give mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine moving air in and out through the tube). Some babies receive surfactant (a medicine that replaces the lung’s slippery substance). The INSURE technique (INtubation, SURfactant, Extubation) briefly uses intubation to give surfactant and then returns the baby to non-invasive support.\n\nWhat did this review look for?\n- We searched for randomized or quasi-randomized trials (studies where babies were assigned to treatments by chance or by a non-random method) that compared nHF with other non-invasive supports (CPAP or NIPPV) when used as primary respiratory support in preterm infants. We combined results across studies and rated the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 13 trials with 2,540 preterm infants. Most infants were ≥28 weeks’ gestation (gestational age = the age of the pregnancy in weeks). Very few were extremely preterm (<28 weeks).\n- In 11 trials, nHF was compared with CPAP. In 4 trials, nHF was compared with NIPPV. Devices and flow settings varied. Some trials allowed rescue CPAP (starting CPAP after nHF fails) or brief intubation for surfactant (INSURE) without counting this as treatment failure. Several trials had unclear or high risk of bias (flaws in study design or conduct).\n- Compared with CPAP, nHF probably increases early treatment failure within 72 hours (about 9 more babies per 100), but probably does not increase need for mechanical ventilation in 72 hours. nHF probably reduces nasal trauma and may reduce pneumothorax, though the pneumothorax result is imprecise. The certainty for death or BPD before discharge is low.\n- Compared with NIPPV, nHF probably gives similar early treatment failure and similar need for mechanical ventilation in 72 hours, probably causes less nasal trauma, and probably makes little to no difference to pneumothorax. Evidence here is limited.\n\nHow confident are we in these findings?\n- Many trials were small or had methods that could bias results. Not all outcomes were reported. For these reasons we have limited confidence. Certainty ranges from moderate to very low depending on the outcome.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We need larger, high-quality trials, especially in extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks). Trials should use consistent device settings, report harms like nasal trauma and pneumothorax clearly, and follow babies longer to assess breathing and development.\n\nLimitations and currency\n- The evidence is current to March 2022. We updated our previous review. Differences in trial methods and limited data reduce certainty.",
