It probably does not change the chance of readmission (returning to hospital after discharge (release of a patient from care)), may improve satisfaction, probably reduces moves into residential care (living in a care home or nursing facility), and likely lowers health service costs (costs paid by the healthcare system).\n- Hospital at home probably shortens the initial length of stay (number of days a patient stays under hospital or hospital-at-home care) and may lower overall societal costs (all costs across society, including patient and family expenses and lost work). Savings varied by study and costing methods, so the size of benefit is uncertain.\n- Future studies should follow people for longer, report harms (unwanted effects) and caregiver (a person who helps the patient) outcomes, compare patient groups and service models, and use consistent methods to measure benefits, readmission, residential care, and costs to show who benefits most.\n\nWhat is \"admission avoidance hospital at home\"?\nAdmission avoidance hospital at home means healthcare teams give active treatment (care meant to directly treat a condition) at a person’s home for a limited time. Teams can include doctors, nurses, and therapists who visit, monitor health, give medicines, oxygen, or intravenous fluids, and arrange transfer to hospital (moving a patient from a home program to hospital when needed) if the person gets worse. This approach is offered instead of acute hospital inpatient care (care inside a hospital when a person stays overnight for an urgent problem).\n\nWhy might avoiding a hospital admission matter?\nWe know hospital care can save lives. But hospital stays can cause harms, especially for older people. These harms include a higher risk of infections, confusion, disturbed sleep, and loss of independence. Being cared for at home can be more comfortable, help people keep routines, and reduce stress for family and carers. It may also reduce pressure on hospital beds and cut resource use (the amount and types of healthcare services and materials used).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to see if admission avoidance hospital at home works as well as, or better than, inpatient care (medical care that requires a person to be admitted to a hospital and stay at least one night). We looked at survival (mortality: number of deaths), readmission, self-reported health status (how patients rate their own health), satisfaction, moves to residential care, length of stay, effects on caregivers, resource use, and costs to the health service and to society.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched databases and trial registries, including CENTRAL (a Cochrane trials database), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (a WHO platform that brings together trial records). We included randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments). We combined results using meta-analysis (a method that pools results from several studies) where possible. We used the GRADE approach (a system to rate how certain we are about the evidence) to judge confidence. We also used individual patient data (original data from each study participant) when available for more detail.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 randomized trials with about 3,100 adults. Four trials involved chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe), two involved people recovering from stroke (loss of blood flow to part of the brain), seven involved mainly older adults with acute medical conditions (problems that start suddenly and last a short time), and the rest had mixed conditions. Follow-up was usually up to 6 months.\nFor older adults, hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to mortality and readmission. It probably reduces moves to residential care and probably reduces health service costs. It probably makes little or no difference to self-reported health, and it may improve satisfaction. Hospital at home may reduce initial length of stay. The effect on caregivers and harms was unclear because few studies reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limits?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. People in studies often knew which care they got, which can cause performance bias (differences in care other than the treatment). Some trials did not report all outcomes. Studies differed by patient group and service model, and methods for costing resource use differed. This variation, and the small number of trials for some outcomes, makes results uncertain.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2022.\n\nTerms we explain (brief)\n- admission avoidance hospital at home (a program giving hospital-level care at home for a short time).\n- hospital at home (healthcare that delivers acute, hospital-level care in a patient’s home).\n- acute hospital inpatient care (care in hospital when a person stays overnight for an urgent problem).\n- inpatient care (medical care that requires a hospital admission and at least one night’s stay).\n- readmission (returning to hospital for another admission after discharge).\n- residential care (living in a care home or nursing facility with daily help).\n- self-reported health status (how patients rate their own health).\n- caregiver (a person who helps the patient with health needs or daily activities).\n- length of stay (number of days a patient stays in hospital or hospital-at-home care).\n- active treatment (care meant to directly treat a condition).\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe).\n- stroke (loss of blood flow to part of the brain that damages brain tissue).\n- acute (happening suddenly and for a short time).\n- randomized controlled trial (a study where people are randomly assigned to different treatments).\n- meta-analysis (a method that combines results from several studies).\n- individual patient data (original, person-level data from each study participant).\n- GRADE approach (a system to rate how certain we are about the evidence).\n- bias (flaws that favour one conclusion); selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias, performance bias, selective reporting (types of bias).\n- confidence interval (the range where results are expected to fall).\n- risk ratio (a measure comparing risk between groups; 1 means no difference).\n- P value (a number showing how likely results are if there were no true effect).\n- I2 statistic (a measure of how much study differences are due to real variation).\n- Cochrane and EPOC Group (groups that produce and guide reviews of healthcare evidence).\n- CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (major trial and literature databases).\n- resource use (amount and types of healthcare services and materials used).\n- health service costs (costs paid by the healthcare system).\n- societal costs (all costs across society, including patient and family expenses and lost work).\n- transfer to hospital (moving a patient from home-based care to hospital when needed).\n- intervention (a treatment or action to prevent or treat disease).\n- effectiveness (how well a treatment works).\n- analysis (breaking complex information into parts to study it).\n- moderate-certainty evidence, low-certainty evidence (how sure we are about the results).",
