  "text": "Title: What do people, health workers, and decision-makers think about general health checks (routine appointments that include several screening tests for people who feel well, to assess overall health and find risks or early signs of disease)?\n\nKey messages\n- Most stakeholders (people affected by or involved in a service, such as clients/patients, health professionals, and managers/policymakers) saw general health checks as acceptable and often useful. Clients said checks gave reassurance (feeling less worried after a professional confirms health) and helped them change habits. Recommendations from health professionals (people who give care, such as doctors and nurses) encouraged attendance.\n- Barriers included fear of bad results, a preference for symptom-based care (seeking care only when you are unwell), time pressures, problems with access and health insurance (a contract that helps pay some health costs), bad experiences with unqualified providers (people who are not properly trained), and limited awareness (knowing that checks exist and what they do). Providers said skilled, culturally competent care (care that understands and respects patients’ cultures and communication needs) helps, but they faced practical problems such as competing demands from curative care (care to treat illness), staff shortages, limited resources, technical faults, and payment or reimbursement issues (how providers are paid).\n- People disagreed about how checks should be done. Clients liked comprehensive checks (complete, covering important tests with clear explanations). Many professionals preferred individualized checks (tailored to a person’s risk). Organized information and invitation systems (ways to contact and invite eligible people) and offering checks in different places (clinics, workplaces, or community sites) probably improve uptake (how many people use a service). Despite a 2019 Cochrane review (a careful summary of research) that found little or no effect on deaths or major heart disease outcomes, checks remained popular where they had long been used.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they used?\n- We define general health checks as routine appointments for people without symptoms (asymptomatic: having no symptoms) that include at least 2 screening tests (checks done when there are no symptoms to find early signs of disease). They aim to spot risk factors such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n- Checks run in national programmes, local services, workplaces, or private companies. Many people value checks for reassurance and motivation to live more healthily.\n\nWho is involved and what do some words mean?\n- Clients are adults who attend checks (a client is a person who uses a health service). Healthcare providers are the staff who deliver checks (such as doctors and nurses). Healthcare managers and policymakers decide how services are planned and paid for.\n- Commissioning (planning, funding, and organising services) decides whether checks are offered. Delivery means how providers put checks into practice. Uptake means whether people choose to attend. Screening means checking for disease when there are no symptoms. Morbidity means illness. Mortality means death. GRADE-CERQual is a way to rate how much confidence we can place in findings from qualitative studies (studies that use interviews, focus groups, and observations to learn about people’s experiences). A qualitative evidence synthesis is a review that brings together such studies to explain views and experiences.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to know how clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners view general health checks. We looked for factors that affect commissioning, delivery, and uptake. We also wanted to explain why checks are used even when measured health benefits seem limited.\n\nHow did we study this?\n- We searched databases and reference lists for qualitative studies about views of commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. We used a framework synthesis approach (a method that organises and compares findings across studies). We assessed study quality and rated our confidence in findings using GRADE-CERQual.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We considered 146 qualitative studies and analysed 36 in depth. Most studies came from high-income European countries. About 1/3 came from middle-income countries in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Studies took place in primary care (first point of contact for health care), workplaces, and community healthcare settings (local, non-hospital places).\n- General health checks probably motivate people to change habits and give reassurance. Recommendations from providers probably increase attendance. Negative experiences with unqualified providers probably reduce attendance. Limited availability, time pressures, and worries about treatment costs probably reduce attendance.\n- Skilled and culturally competent providers probably make checks more acceptable. Delivery is probably reduced by competing demands with curative care, staff shortages, resource limits, technical problems, and payment or reimbursement issues. Offering checks in a range of convenient places probably improves uptake. Information, invitations, and education probably increase awareness and attendance. We do not know if wider cultural, social, or policy factors affect uptake.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- We are moderately confident in our findings. The studies did not cover all groups or settings. They used different delivery methods. There were not enough studies to be certain about some outcomes.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- Future work should explain why services are commissioned and maintained. It should test delivery approaches that balance people’s preferences, clear communication of results, access, and resource constraints (staff, time, equipment, or money). Research should include under-represented groups and assess unwanted effects such as anxiety, overtesting (testing more than needed), and financial burden (money problems caused by paying for care), and costs.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
