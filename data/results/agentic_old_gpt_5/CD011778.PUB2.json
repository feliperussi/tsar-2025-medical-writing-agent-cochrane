Most studies reported no unwanted effects (adverse effects: harmful or unwanted effects of a treatment). There is not enough evidence to know if aPDT helps for peri-implant diseases (inflammatory problems around dental implants that can affect the gum and bone).\n- The evidence was limited because many studies were small or short and did not report outcomes people care about, such as pocket closure (whether deep gum pockets become shallow), patient satisfaction, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), or changes in bone around implants (an implant: an object put in the body to replace a tooth).\n- We need stronger research: large, well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs: studies where people are randomly put into groups by chance) with longer follow-up that include people with disease around implants, compare aPDT plus deep cleaning with deep cleaning alone or a placebo (an inactive or sham treatment), and report benefits, unwanted effects, and costs.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat are gum disease and problems around dental implants?\nWe looked at long-lasting (chronic: long-lasting) infections that affect natural teeth or dental implants. Periodontitis causes ongoing inflammation (a body response that may include swelling and redness) that harms gums and the jawbone that support teeth. This can lead to loose teeth and tooth loss. Peri-implant diseases range from peri-implant mucositis (gum inflammation around an implant without bone loss) to peri-implantitis (infection and inflammation around an implant that causes bone loss). Soft tissue (muscle, fat, and other supporting tissue) around teeth or implants can also be affected.\n\nHow are these conditions usually treated?\nWe aim to stop infection, reduce inflammation, and protect bone and soft tissue. A key step is deep cleaning under the gumline (subgingival instrumentation/scaling and root planing). Deep cleaning removes biofilm (a sticky layer of bacteria that sticks to tooth surfaces) and tartar. We also support better daily oral hygiene (cleaning) and address risk factors such as smoking. Some people need surgery. After the initial treatment, people often have ongoing maintenance care (supportive periodontal therapy: regular check-ups and cleanings) to prevent the disease from returning.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT)?\naPDT is an add-on (adjunctive) treatment used with standard deep cleaning. The dentist applies a photosensitising agent (a light-sensitive dye). When we shine a specific light, the dye becomes active and produces substances that kill bacteria. The idea is that aPDT may reach bacteria in places that instruments cannot clean well.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to deep cleaning helps adults with periodontitis or peri-implant diseases more than deep cleaning alone or deep cleaning with a placebo. We also wanted to know if aPDT causes unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for adult studies that compared deep cleaning plus aPDT with deep cleaning alone or a sham (placebo). We looked at both initial treatment and maintenance care. We combined results when suitable and judged how confident we were in the evidence using methods such as the GRADE approach (a system for rating how reliable the evidence is).\n\nResults — What did we find?\nWe found 50 RCTs with 1,407 adults, almost all with periodontitis. No study included people with peri-implantitis. One very small study looked at peri-implant mucositis but gave no 6-month results. Most trials were small (10 to 88 people). Many used a split-mouth design (different parts of the same person’s mouth get different treatments); 18 used a parallel-group design (separate groups get different treatments). In every study, aPDT came after deep cleaning. Most trials gave aPDT in 1 session; some gave 2 to 4 sessions. Forty-four studies looked at active treatment; 6 looked at maintenance care. Studies measured change from the start to about 6 months. They checked unwanted effects but did not report pocket closure, patient views, or quality of life.\n\nWe are very uncertain whether adding aPDT changes key measures at 6 months. These measures include:\n- Probing pocket depth (measured depth between gum and tooth).\n- Bleeding on probing (whether gums bleed when gently probed).\n- Clinical attachment level (how much support a tooth has lost).\n- Gingival recession (gum pull-back that exposes more of the tooth).\n\nWhere differences appeared, they were small and not clinically important. Adding aPDT probably makes little to no difference to unwanted effects. The evidence is limited by small studies and by problems in study design.\n\nLimitations\nWe lack confidence in the evidence because some people in the studies may have known which treatment they got. Studies used different methods and included different kinds of people. Many studies were very small. Key outcomes that matter to patients were not reported.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
