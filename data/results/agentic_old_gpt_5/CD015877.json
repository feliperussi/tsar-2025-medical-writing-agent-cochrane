The few small studies that used a computer-based decision support tool (a computer program that combines a person’s data to help create personalized diet recommendations) gave inconsistent results. The studies did not report harmful or unwanted effects (adverse events: an unwanted event that causes harm).\n- The studies tested only a computer tool, so the findings may not apply to other forms of precision nutrition such as using genes (DNA: our inherited genetic material) or the gut microbiome (the collection of microorganisms in the digestive system). The trials did not report outcomes that matter to families, such as mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life (how health affects day-to-day life), or costs.\n- We recommend larger, longer, well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs: studies where people are assigned by chance to different groups) across age groups that clearly describe how the advice is personalized and that measure outcomes important to families, including any harms.\n\nWhy is excess weight in children and teenagers a concern?\nOverweight (weighing more than is healthy for one’s height) and obesity (a long-term condition with a high amount of body fat) are common in childhood and adolescence. Carrying too much weight raises the chance of problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep problems, joint pain, and low mood or low self-esteem. These problems can continue into adulthood. Usual care often gives general one-size-fits-all advice (a program that gives the same advice to everyone) about eating and activity, sometimes in family programs. Because children differ in bodies, habits, and environments, people are interested in approaches that tailor support to each person.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition and how could it help?\nPrecision nutrition means giving diet and lifestyle advice that fits a person’s unique characteristics. These can include genes (DNA), current eating habits, the gut microbiome (the microorganisms in the gut), daily body rhythms (circadian rhythms: the body’s 24-hour internal clock), activity, health conditions, and social or psychological factors. Some precision nutrition approaches use digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI: computers that learn and help make decisions) or machine learning (computer methods that find patterns in data) to combine this information and suggest personalised advice. The hope is that tailored advice will help young people manage weight better than standard advice.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether precision nutrition-based interventions (programs that give personalized diet guidance using a person’s unique information) help children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity manage weight better than general advice or no intervention. We looked for effects on body weight and BMI, and on mental and physical well-being, activity, health-related quality of life (how health affects everyday life), obesity-related disability, and adverse events (harmful effects).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched databases up to July 2024 with no language limits. We looked for studies in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity that compared precision nutrition approaches with usual care. We summarized results on weight, BMI, and well-being and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 small trials with 105 young people in total. The trials took place in Ukraine and Greece. Both tested a computer-based decision support tool (a program that uses a person’s data to make individualized diet plans) and compared it with standard advice. Only 1 trial (65 participants) reported results for main outcomes. The trials did not report mental or emotional well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, disability, or adverse events. One study reported nonprofit funding; the other did not state its funding source.\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. The studies were small and few. People in the studies may have known which treatment they received. Not all outcomes were reported. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nWe do not know if precision nutrition, as tested in these studies, helps children or teenagers with overweight or obesity lose weight or lower BMI compared with standard advice. The results apply only to the type of tool studied and not to other precision methods. Families and health services should not change practice based on this limited evidence. Future research should use larger, longer, well-designed RCTs that measure outcomes important to families and report any harms.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
