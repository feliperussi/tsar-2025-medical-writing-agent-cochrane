  "text": "Title\nAfter surgery to repair a detached retina that affects the macula (the center of sharp vision), is it better to lie face-down than to use other positions?\n\nKey messages\n- We found too little good evidence to say for sure if lying face-down (face-down positioning: keeping your face pointed toward the floor so the gas bubble presses the repaired area) after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV: eye surgery that removes the vitreous gel to repair the retina) with a gas tamponade (a temporary gas bubble placed in the eye that presses the retina into place) is better than other positions.\n- From 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies that assign people at random to treatments) with 368 people (369 study eyes), immediate face-down positioning may reduce retinal displacement (a small shift in the retina’s position after reattachment that can cause metamorphopsia — straight lines looking wavy), and it may lower outer retinal folds (small creases in the outer retina) and binocular diplopia (double vision when both eyes are open). We are very uncertain about these findings.\n- Face-down positioning did not clearly improve best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA: how clearly you see with your best glasses). It may increase elevated intraocular pressure (a rise in pressure inside the eyeball). Overall, we rated the certainty of the evidence as very low using the GRADE approach (a system that shows how confident we can be in the evidence).\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment, and why is it serious?\n- The retina is a thin nerve layer at the back of the eye that senses light. The macula (the part used for reading and seeing fine detail) sits at the center of the retina.\n- A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD: a tear in the retina lets fluid slip under it so the retina peels away) can lift the macula off the eye wall. This threatens central vision. The longer the macula stays detached, the higher the risk of lasting vision problems.\n\nHow is this emergency treated, and what is a gas tamponade?\n- Surgeons often do pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). They remove the vitreous gel, treat the retinal tear with laser or freezing, and place a gas tamponade (a temporary gas bubble that presses the retina back while it heals). The gas slowly absorbs and is replaced by the eye’s fluid.\n- After surgery, doctors may ask patients to keep a certain head position so the bubble rests on the intended area. Options include face-down positioning, face-up positioning (lying on the back), or support-the-break positioning (placing the head so the bubble rests over the retinal tear).\n\nWhy do surgeons ask people to lie face-down after surgery?\n- The idea is that the gas bubble will sit on the macula and nearby retina. This may reduce retinal displacement and related problems such as metamorphopsia (wavy or warped vision), binocular diplopia, and outer retinal folds.\n- Face-down positioning can be uncomfortable or hard to do. It may raise intraocular pressure, which can harm the optic nerve if not treated. Patients with neck or back problems may find it especially difficult.\n\nWhat did we aim to find?\n- We asked whether face-down positioning after PPV with gas tamponade for macula-involving RRD reduces retinal displacement compared with other positions (such as support-the-break or face-up) or no specific positioning.\n- We also looked at vision (BCVA), visual distortion (metamorphopsia), quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), and eye-related complications such as outer retinal folds, binocular diplopia, and raised intraocular pressure.\n\nHow we did the review\n- We searched databases to 28 November 2022 for RCTs that compared positioning after PPV with gas tamponade. We pooled results when we could and rated our confidence in the evidence using Cochrane methods and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 3 RCTs with 368 people (369 eyes). Most participants were men (about 68% to 72%). One trial provided race, trial registration, and funding details.\n- Follow-up ranged from about 1 month to 6 months. Trials measured different outcomes and reported results in different ways.\n\nMain results\n- Immediate face-down positioning may reduce retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning. We are very uncertain about this result.\n- Face-down positioning did not clearly improve BCVA. We are very uncertain.\n- There was little or no clear difference in metamorphopsia or in patient-reported quality of life at about 6 months. Evidence is very uncertain.\n- One trial suggested fewer outer retinal folds and less binocular diplopia with face-down at 6 months versus support-the-break. Another trial found little difference earlier after surgery. Overall, the data hint at benefit but remain uncertain.\n- Face-down positioning may increase elevated intraocular pressure after surgery. Trials did not report non-eye-related adverse events.\n\nLimitations\n- Trials were few, small, and varied in design and outcomes. Not all outcomes were reported. Participants and those assessing some outcomes may have known the assigned position, which raises risk of bias (flaws in study design or methods that can lead to incorrect conclusions). These problems lower our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat this means for patients and clinicians\n- We cannot make firm recommendations. Clinicians and patients should weigh possible benefits (less retinal displacement, folds, or double vision) against possible harms (higher intraocular pressure), comfort, and other health issues.\n- We need more, larger, well-designed RCTs that compare face-down with other positions, measure outcomes that matter to patients, and carefully track all unwanted effects. Ongoing studies may give clearer answers.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is current to 28 November 2022.",
