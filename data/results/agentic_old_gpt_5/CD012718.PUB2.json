SDF may also stop existing decay in baby teeth (primary teeth, a child’s first set of teeth).\n- We found no clear advantage of SDF over other options such as fluoride varnish (a painted-on fluoride coating), sealants (thin protective coatings on chewing surfaces), resin infiltration (a liquid resin that soaks into early decay), or atraumatic restorative treatment, ART (treating cavities with hand tools and filling without drilling). We do not know the best strength, how often to apply SDF, or the best duration.\n- Studies gave little reliable information about unwanted effects (adverse effects, unwanted or harmful effects) such as staining of treated spots (black discoloration), pain, or tooth sensitivity (how the tooth reacts to temperature or touch). We need larger, longer, well-designed trials.\n\nWhat is tooth decay and why is it a problem?\nTooth decay (dental caries, cavities) happens when sugars feed mouth bacteria and produce acids that damage the tooth surface. This can cause holes (cavities), pain, and infection. Untreated decay can affect eating, sleeping, speech, confidence, and nutrition. Decay can be on the crown (coronal surface, the part above the gum) or on the root (root caries). Usual options include fluoride toothpaste, fluoride varnish, sealants, and fillings.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride (SDF)?\nSDF is a topical treatment (applied on the surface of the tooth). It contains silver (which kills bacteria) and fluoride (which helps harden tooth tissue). Dentists paint a clear liquid onto the tooth. It does not require drilling. A common concern is permanent dark staining (black discoloration) of the treated, decayed area.\n\nWhat did this review want to find out?\nWe asked whether SDF prevents new cavities and stops existing ones from getting worse (caries arrest, when a cavity stops progressing). We asked how SDF compares with placebo (a dummy treatment with no medicine), no treatment, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, and ART (atraumatic restorative treatment: removing soft decay with hand tools and filling the tooth, often using glass ionomer cement, a filling that releases fluoride). We also checked different ways of applying SDF (strength, frequency, and duration) and unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatments). We combined results where we could. We rated our confidence in the evidence (certainty of evidence, also called GRADE, which shows how much we trust the results).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 29 randomized trials with 13,036 people (12,020 children and 1,016 older adults). The trials looked at baby (primary) and adult (permanent) teeth and at both crowns and roots.\n- SDF was compared with placebo or no treatment in 14 studies, with different ways of applying SDF in 5 studies, with fluoride varnish in 8 studies, with sealants or resin infiltration in 2 studies, and with ART using glass ionomer materials in 4 studies.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n- Compared with no treatment or placebo, SDF probably reduces new cavities on root surfaces (moderate-certainty evidence: we are fairly confident but more research could change the result).\n- SDF may stop existing decay in baby teeth from getting worse. The evidence here is less certain.\n- We do not know if SDF prevents new cavities on crowns of children’s or adults’ teeth, or if it stops existing decay in adult teeth. We also do not know if SDF affects early lesions, causes unwanted effects, or changes pain, sensitivity, or appearance. Many of these outcomes have low or very low certainty of evidence (we have limited or very little confidence in the results).\n- We could not show that any particular way of applying SDF works better than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small. Some may have been biased because participants or study staff knew which treatment they received. Not all studies reported all outcomes we wanted. Trials used different people and different ways to give the treatment. These issues reduce our confidence in the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to June 2023.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nSDF is a quick, simple option. It probably prevents root cavities and may stop decay in baby teeth. It often leaves a permanent dark stain on treated decay. Because the evidence has limits, we need larger, longer, well-designed trials that measure both benefits and harms to guide clear recommendations.",
