  "text": "Title: Does adding anti-VEGF (medicines that block vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, a substance made by cells that helps new blood vessels grow) to vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove the vitreous gel, the clear jelly-like substance that fills the center of the eye) reduce bleeding and improve vision for people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR; an advanced form of diabetic eye disease where fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that giving an anti-VEGF injection (a medicine injected into the eye, called an intravitreal injection, that blocks VEGF) before or during vitrectomy for PDR probably lowers late postoperative bleeding (bleeding that happens after 4 weeks). The chance fell from about 23% to about 10% (high certainty).\n- Injections also probably lower early postoperative bleeding (within 4 weeks) and reduce retinal tears during surgery (a retinal tear or break is a hole or tear in the retina). Vision at about 6 months may be slightly better with an injection, but the evidence is less certain. Reported harms were few, but studies did not fully describe harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?\nPDR (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) is an advanced form of diabetic eye disease. High blood sugar over time can damage small blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye). In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina and in the vitreous gel (the clear jelly-like substance that fills the center of the eye). These vessels can bleed into the vitreous gel (called vitreous hemorrhage, bleeding into the eye’s jelly). Bleeding can cause sudden vision loss. Scar tissue (fibrous tissue that forms as part of healing) can form and pull on the retina. If this pulls the retina away, it causes a tractional retinal detachment (scar tissue pulls the retina off the back of the eye). These problems often need surgery.\n\nWhat is vitrectomy and what problems can happen with it?\nVitrectomy is an operation in which the surgeon removes the cloudy vitreous gel and replaces it with a clear fluid. This clears blood and lets the surgeon remove scar tissue and repair the retina. During the operation (intraoperative, happening during surgery), the retina can tear or break. After surgery (postoperative, after surgery), bleeding can happen again. The retina can detach and scar tissue can reform. These problems can delay recovery, limit vision, and sometimes mean more surgery (revision surgery) is needed.\n\nWhat are anti-VEGF eye injections and how might they help?\nAnti-VEGF medicines block VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), the substance that tells new blood vessels to grow. Doctors give these medicines as injections into the eye (intravitreal injections, given into the vitreous gel). Anti-VEGF can shrink or stop abnormal, fragile blood vessels. Given shortly before or during vitrectomy, they may make surgery easier, lower bleeding during and after the operation, and help vision recover.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether anti-VEGF injections given around the time of vitrectomy for PDR complications improve vision, reduce bleeding during and after surgery, reduce surgical complications such as retinal tears or detachments, lower the need for more surgery (revision surgery), or change vision-related quality of life (how eyesight affects daily activities and well-being).\n\nHow we did the review\nWe searched medical databases up to June 2022 for randomized studies (RCTs; studies that assign people by chance to different treatments). We compared injections given before or during vitrectomy with vitrectomy alone. We combined results on vision, bleeding, surgical complications, need for more surgery, and harms. We rated how certain the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 28 randomized studies that included 1,914 eyes. Most studies followed people for up to about 6 months. No study reported vision-related quality of life (how eyesight affects daily activities).\n- Late postoperative bleeding (after 4 weeks) fell from about 23% without injection to about 10% with injection (high certainty).\n- Early postoperative bleeding (within 4 weeks) probably fell from about 31% to about 12% (moderate certainty).\n- Retinal tears during surgery fell from about 31% to about 12% with injections (high certainty).\n- Vision around 6 months may be slightly better with injections (low certainty).\n- It is unclear whether injections lower the need for more surgery or the use of silicone oil (filling the eye with silicone oil at the end of surgery to hold the retina in place). Reported harms from injections were few, but harms were not well described.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident overall. Some studies may not have kept people or outcome assessors unaware of treatment (masking or blinding), which can bias results. Not all studies reported all outcomes. Follow-up was often short.\n\nWhat are the implications?\nAnti-VEGF injections given before or during vitrectomy for PDR complications appear to lower bleeding after surgery and reduce retinal tears during surgery. They may give a small vision benefit by about 6 months. We need larger, better-quality studies with longer follow-up and consistent outcome measures to confirm benefits, compare different anti-VEGF drugs and timing, and fully assess harms, costs, need for more surgery, and effects on daily life.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
