  "text": "Title: Which method works best and is safest for preparing the womb lining before frozen embryo transfer (placing a frozen embryo into the womb): a natural menstrual cycle, hormone therapy, or ovulation-inducing drugs?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no strong evidence that one method of preparing the womb lining before frozen embryo transfer (FET) (a fertility procedure where an embryo that was previously frozen is thawed and placed into the uterus) works better or is safer than the others. Results were similar for natural menstrual cycles (no medicines, tracking your own ovulation), modified natural cycles using an hCG trigger (human chorionic gonadotrophin injection; a hormone used to trigger final egg release), hormone therapy cycles (oestrogen and progesterone medicines to build the womb lining), and hormone therapy with a GnRHa (gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist; a drug that temporarily switches off the body’s reproductive hormone signals).\n- Miscarriage (an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week) and multiple pregnancy (pregnancies with more than one baby, such as twins) rates appeared similar across these approaches. Other unwanted effects were rarely reported.\n- The evidence is uncertain. Future trials should be larger, report outcomes that matter to patients, and follow families long enough to detect harms for mother and baby.\n\nWhat is frozen embryo transfer and why does preparing the womb lining matter?\nWe reviewed frozen embryo transfer (FET) (a fertility procedure where an embryo that was previously frozen is thawed and placed into the uterus). An embryo (an early stage of development after an egg is fertilised) must attach to the womb lining (the endometrium; the layer of tissue that lines the uterus). The lining must have the right thickness and be ready at the right time. Preparing the lining (endometrial preparation; getting the uterine lining ready to accept an embryo) helps match the timing of the embryo and the womb. This may affect the chance of a live birth (the delivery of a living baby).\n\nHow can the womb lining be prepared before FET?\nClinics use several approaches:\n- Natural cycle FET (timing the transfer to a person’s own ovulation; ovulation is the release of an egg from an ovary).\n- Modified natural cycle with an hCG trigger (a human chorionic gonadotrophin injection given to trigger final egg release).\n- Hormone therapy (HT) cycles (using oestrogen, a hormone that thickens the uterine lining, and progesterone, a hormone important in pregnancy, to build and time the lining).\n- HT cycles with GnRHa suppression (GnRHa: a drug that temporarily switches off natural reproductive hormone signals so doctors can control timing).\n- Ovulation induction cycles (using medicines to make ovulation happen) were not assessed in the trials we found.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe compared which preparation method gives the highest chance of a live birth and how the methods compare for harms such as miscarriage and multiple pregnancy. We also compared subtypes, for example natural versus modified natural with hCG, and HT with versus without GnRHa.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registers up to 19 December 2022 for randomised trials (a study where people are randomly assigned to different treatments to fairly compare outcomes). We pooled results when possible and rated how certain the evidence is.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 randomised trials that included 6,352 women having FET. Trials compared natural cycles, modified natural cycles with hCG, HT cycles with oestrogen and progesterone, and HT cycles with added GnRHa. No trials tested ovulation induction cycles. Across comparisons, we found no clear evidence that any one method improved live birth rates. Miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates also appeared similar. For some direct comparisons (for example HT with versus without GnRHa, or natural versus modified natural), the chances of ongoing pregnancy (a pregnancy that continues beyond the early weeks, often confirmed by a fetal heartbeat or reaching around 10–12 weeks) and miscarriage were broadly similar. Overall certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence. Many trials were small. People in some studies may have known which treatment they received. Not all trials reported the outcomes we wanted. Few outcome events occurred for some comparisons, so estimates are imprecise (when study results are not precise, often shown by wide confidence intervals).\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture trials should be larger and better designed. They should report outcomes that matter to patients, such as live birth, harms for mother and baby, treatment burden and convenience, and costs. They should follow families long enough to find later problems for pregnancy and the newborn. Studies should report safety outcomes more consistently.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 19 December 2022.",
