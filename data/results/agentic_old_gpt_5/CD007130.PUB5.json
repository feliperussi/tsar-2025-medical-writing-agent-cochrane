  "text": "Is doing cardiac rehabilitation (a recovery program after a heart problem) at home as effective as going to a hospital or clinic?\n\nKey messages\n- For people recovering from a heart problem, home-based cardiac rehabilitation (a structured program patients do at home, often supported by phone, video, or apps) works about as well as supervised centre-based programmes (sessions at a hospital or community centre). We found similar effects on mortality (the number of deaths), exercise capacity (how much physical activity someone can safely do), and health-related quality of life (how someone’s health affects their day-to-day life).\n- Participation and completion (starting and finishing the programme) were similar for home and centre settings. Costs per patient were also similar. Most home programmes used telehealth (health care given from a distance using phones, video, or the internet) and were supervised by healthcare staff.\n- More well-designed research is needed to check long-term effects, report unwanted or harmful effects (harms) clearly, test programmes in other heart conditions such as after valve surgery or with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat), and compare hybrid models (programmes that combine centre and home elements).\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is recovery care needed?\nWe mean disease of the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). It includes heart attack (an interruption in the blood supply to the heart), angina (chest pain from poor blood flow to the heart), and heart failure (when the heart cannot pump blood well enough). These conditions cause most deaths worldwide. After a heart problem or a procedure to restore blood flow (revascularisation, a procedure such as a stent or bypass surgery), people face higher risk of future heart issues. They often need structured help to recover, get fitter, and lower that risk.\n\nWhat is cardiac rehabilitation and how can it be delivered?\nCardiac rehabilitation (a structured programme to help people recover after a heart problem) usually includes supervised exercise, education about heart-healthy living, and support to change modifiable cardiac risk factors (health and lifestyle factors that can be changed, such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, poor diet, low activity, and excess weight). Centre-based programmes run in hospitals or community centres and are led by health staff. Home-based programmes happen at home and may use telehealth (remote care using phones, video, or apps) or other technology. Technology-supported options can make taking part easier when travel, work, caring responsibilities, or events like the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) limit in-person services.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe compared home-based cardiac rehabilitation (including telehealth) with supervised centre-based rehabilitation for adults with heart disease. We looked at deaths and health problems (mortality and morbidity; morbidity means the number of people who develop illness or medical problems), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors.\n\nMethods\nWe searched medical databases, trial registers (public lists of planned and completed clinical studies), and earlier reviews for trials that compared home-based with supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation in adults. We combined results from trials on deaths, exercise capacity, quality of life, and risk factors. We rated our confidence in the findings using standard methods.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 24 randomised controlled trials (studies where people were randomly assigned to different treatments) with 3,046 adults who had a heart attack, revascularisation, or heart failure. Most trials followed people for up to 12 months. Only 3 studies gave longer-term results, and some quality-of-life results went to 24 months. The review did not report the countries or the funding sources of the trials. It did not include people after valve surgery or with atrial fibrillation.\n\nCompared with centre-based rehabilitation, home-based rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to deaths, short-term fitness (exercise capacity), quality of life, or programme completion. Over longer periods, home-based rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to fitness. Overall, home and centre programmes appear similarly effective for the outcomes we studied.\n\nLimitations\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. People in the trials may have known which treatment they received, which can cause bias (flaws in study design that favour one result). Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. Many trials were small or short. The evidence does not cover all people, heart conditions, or programme types.\n\nWhat this means for patients and services\nBoth home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation can help people recover after a heart problem. Home programmes that use telehealth may increase access for people who cannot attend in person. We need more high-quality trials that measure and report harms clearly, test hybrid models (combined centre and home programmes), and include other heart conditions.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates a previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",
