  "text": "Title: Do changes to shift work schedules (work hours in evenings, nights, or rotating shifts) help workers sleep better, sleep longer, or feel less sleepy?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found limited, low-trust evidence and cannot be certain which schedule changes help most.\n- Limiting the maximum (the most or largest amount) length of a shift may increase sleep time between shifts (off-shift: the time when a worker is not on duty) and may slightly lower sleepiness during shifts. Other changes showed little or uncertain benefit.\n\nWhat is shift work and why can it affect sleep and safety?\n- Shift work means working outside usual daytime hours, such as evenings, nights, early mornings, or rotating among these times. This can disrupt the body’s internal clock (daily rhythm that controls when we feel awake or sleepy). Not sleeping enough can make people very sleepy on duty and slower to react. This can raise the chance (risk) of mistakes and accidents.\n\nWhat kinds of schedule changes might help?\n- Employers and workers can try different plans (schedule: a plan or planning a time to do something). These include:\n  - Fixed shifts versus rotating shifts.\n  - Direction of rotation: forward rotation (shifts move later, e.g., day → evening → night) and backward rotation (shifts move earlier, e.g., night → evening → day).\n  - Speed of rotation (how often workers switch: fast means every few days, slow means every 1–several weeks).\n  - Shift duration and maximum daily shift length.\n  - Start times and time off between shifts (minimum rest period: hours off to rest between shifts).\n  - Split shifts (a workday split into parts), protected sleep (guaranteed time to sleep during long shifts), compressed workweeks (same total hours in fewer, longer days), and worker participation in designing schedules.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\n- We asked whether these schedule changes improve three outcomes (outcome: a specific result that can be measured): sleep quality off duty (how restful sleep feels), sleep duration off duty (how long people sleep), and sleepiness during shifts.\n\nHow did we find and judge the evidence?\n- We searched several databases to April 2022. We included 11 studies with 2,125 shift workers.\n- The studies used different study designs (study design: the way a study is set up). This included randomized controlled trials (RCT: a study where people are assigned by chance to different groups to keep groups similar), controlled before–after trials (CBA: compare changes over time with a separate control group), and non-randomized cross-over trials (participants receive more than one treatment in sequence). One study took place in a laboratory.\n- We collected data (information from people in the studies). We summarized the results (findings from the study) and rated how much we trust the evidence using GRADE (a system that rates how trustworthy the evidence, from very low to high).\n- We note common technical terms used in studies: questionnaire (a list of questions for study participants), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS: a quick rating of how sleepy someone feels), Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ: a standard sleep questionnaire), mean (the average), mean difference (MD: the average difference between groups), standardised mean difference (SMD: a way to compare results measured on different scales), confidence interval (the range of numbers that likely contains the true result), meta-analysis (a method that combines results from several studies), random-effects model (a way to combine studies that assumes effects can vary), and the Cochrane risk of bias tool (a checklist to judge whether a study’s design or conduct could skew results).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Limiting the maximum length of shifts (one study used 16 hours within an 80-hour workweek) increased sleep time between shifts and probably caused small reductions in sleepiness during shifts.\n- Forward versus backward rotation probably made little to no difference to sleep quality or sleep time. It may reduce sleepiness but we are very uncertain.\n- Faster versus slower rotation appeared to make little to no difference to sleep quality. Faster rotation may reduce sleepiness but may shorten sleep time. We are very uncertain.\n- Shorter (8–10 hour) versus longer shifts and compressed versus spread-out workweeks did not clearly change sleep or sleepiness.\n- We found no reliable evidence for changing start times, increasing time off between shifts (minimum rest period), split shifts, protected sleep periods, or worker participation in designing schedules.\n- Studies used varied methods and outcomes. Some results were inconsistent or heterogeneous (made up of elements that are not alike). We could not combine some results because studies were not clinically homogeneous (not similar enough in people, treatments, or outcomes).\n\nHow certain are we about these results?\n- We are not confident. Many studies did not randomly assign people and so may have bias (flaws in study design or conduct that favour one result). Studies used different measures and methods. Some results were inconsistent and few studies reported all needed data (information). Overall, the evidence is limited and often of low certainty.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We need better studies in real workplaces. These should use standard measures of sleep quality and sleep duration (for example, validated questionnaires) and standard measures of sleepiness (for example, KSS). Studies should follow people longer, report harms (adverse: harmful) and costs, and include different jobs and types of shift work. They should aim to be large, well-designed trials or strong controlled studies (for example, cluster-randomised trials, interrupted time series) and report results clearly so we can assess and, if possible, combine findings.\n\nCurrency: The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
