  "text": "How effective and safe are medicines, talking therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation (a treatment that uses weak magnetic or electrical pulses through the scalp to change brain activity without surgery) used alone or together for depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain because most studies were small and of low quality. Medicines (pharmacological intervention: treatment using medicines) and talking therapies (psychological therapy: talk-based treatments such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy) may reduce depression. Non-invasive brain stimulation alone may have little or no effect.\n- Medicines may cause more unwanted effects (adverse events: an unwanted event that causes harm), especially affecting the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal system (the organs that take in food and break it down). Combining medicines with non-invasive brain stimulation (combination therapy: more than one treatment used together) may reduce depression slightly more than medicines alone, but the evidence is limited and mixed.\n- Future research should use larger, well-designed randomized trials (clinical trials: research studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatments), compare treatments directly, measure the same outcomes (outcome: a specific result that can be measured), follow people for longer (follow-up), and report unwanted effects in detail.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke, and why is it a concern?\nA stroke (a loss of blood flow to part of the brain that can damage brain tissue) can cause long-term problems. Many people develop depression (a mental condition with ongoing sadness, low energy, and difficulty with daily life). Symptoms include low mood, loss of interest, tiredness, sleep or appetite changes, and hopeless thoughts. Depression can reduce participation in rehabilitation, slow recovery, and lower quality of life for the person and their family. It is often missed or not fully treated.\n\nWhat treatments are used to help with depression after stroke?\nCommon options are:\n- Medicines (pharmacological intervention). They aim to lift mood and reduce symptoms.\n- Talking therapies (psychological therapy). These are talk-based treatments to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours. Examples include counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy.\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation. This uses magnetic pulses or mild electrical currents applied to the scalp.\nThese treatments may be used alone or together (combination therapy). Like all treatments, they can help and can also cause adverse events.\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe asked whether medicines, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, or combinations reduce depression after stroke. We also asked whether they increase the number of people who respond to treatment (response: an improvement related to treatment) and what harms they cause. Studies compared treatments with placebo (an inactive substance or treatment), sham stimulation (a placebo version of brain stimulation that feels similar but has no active stimulation), or usual care (the care a provider would normally give). This review is a living systematic review (a review kept up to date by regularly adding new studies).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched multiple databases (organized collections of research articles) and clinical trials registers (public lists of planned and ongoing trials) for randomized trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments). We included trials that compared medicines, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, or their combinations with placebo, sham, or usual care. We combined results on benefits and harms and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (a system for rating how much trust we can place in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 65 randomized trials with 5,831 adults after stroke. The trials compared:\n- Medicines versus placebo.\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation versus sham stimulation or usual care.\n- Psychological therapies versus usual care or attention control (a comparison that gives similar time and attention but not the active treatment).\n- Combinations: medicines plus psychological therapy; medicines plus non-invasive brain stimulation; and non-invasive brain stimulation plus psychological therapy.\nOverall, the certainty of the evidence was very low (very low-certainty evidence: we have very little confidence in the result). Key findings:\n- Medicines may reduce the number of people who remain depressed. They may also increase adverse events, such as dizziness or sleepiness (central nervous system effects) and nausea (gastrointestinal effects).\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation may have little to no effect on depression.\n- Psychological therapies may reduce depression.\n- Adding non-invasive brain stimulation to medicines may reduce depression slightly compared with medicines alone. The evidence for this is limited and mixed. Effects on deaths and serious harms are uncertain. Studies of medicines plus psychological therapy and of brain stimulation plus psychological therapy did not report the main outcomes we needed.\nWhen reported, deaths and serious harms were rare and similar between groups.\n\nHow confident are we in these results?\nWe are not confident. Most studies were small and varied in who took part and how treatments were given. This variation (heterogeneity: how different study results are from each other) and possible flaws in study design (bias: problems that can lead to wrong conclusions) make the results uncertain.\n\nWhat are the main limitations and what should future research do?\n- Studies were small and of variable quality.\n- Many outcomes were not reported.\n- Different methods made it hard to combine results.\nFuture trials should be larger, run well, compare treatments directly (head-to-head), use the same outcomes, include longer follow-up, and report adverse events in detail.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
