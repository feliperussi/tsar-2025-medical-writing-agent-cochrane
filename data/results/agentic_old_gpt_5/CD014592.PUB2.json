Most studies tested topical oestrogen (oestrogen put on the surface of the body, here inside the vagina) added to other care, so we cannot tell the effect of oestrogen alone.\n- In small studies that added vaginal oestrogen to a pessary (a removable device placed in the vagina to support dropped organs), women had fewer vaginal problems (such as irritation, discharge, or bleeding). In small studies that added vaginal oestrogen to surgery (an operation to repair or support tissues), women had fewer urinary tract infections (UTIs; infections of the urinary system, most often the bladder). These findings are uncertain because studies were small and varied.\n- Future research needs larger, well-designed trials that test oestrogen on its own and with pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the pelvic organs), pessaries, or surgery. Trials should measure symptoms, quality of life, unwanted effects, and costs, and follow women for longer.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why does it matter?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP; when pelvic organs like the uterus/womb, bladder, or rectum drop from their normal place and bulge into the vagina) happens when the tissues and muscles that hold these organs weaken. This can cause a feeling of pressure, a bulge in the vagina (the muscular canal from the uterus to the outside), trouble passing urine or stool, pain during sex, and lower quality of life. POP is common after childbirth and after menopause. Risk rises with age, having given birth (parous), and higher BMI (body mass index, a measure of weight for height).\n\nWhat treatments are used for prolapse?\nTreatment depends on symptoms and how they affect daily life. Options include:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (exercises, often called Kegels, to strengthen the muscles that support the pelvic organs).\n- A vaginal pessary (a removable device placed in the vagina to support organs).\n- Surgery (an operation to repair or support tissues).\nWe also advise lifestyle changes like weight management and avoiding heavy lifting. Oestrogen therapy (treatment that gives oestrogen to improve vaginal tissues) is another option, usually for postmenopausal women.\n\nWhat is oestrogen therapy and how might it help?\nOestrogen keeps vaginal and pelvic tissues thicker, more elastic, and better lubricated. After menopause, oestrogen levels fall and tissues can thin and dry. Topical oestrogen (low-dose oestrogen put into the vagina as a cream, tablet, or ring) mainly affects vaginal tissues. Systemic oestrogen (a pill or patch) affects the whole body. Oestrogen might make the vagina healthier, help women use a pessary, aid healing after surgery, and reduce irritation or infections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy for postmenopausal women with POP. We looked for studies of topical or systemic oestrogen, used alone or with other care, compared with no treatment, placebo (a dummy treatment), or other care. We also looked for studies on complications and cost-effectiveness.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases and clinical trial registers up to June 2022. We planned to use GRADE (a system to rate how certain we are about the evidence) but sparse data limited this.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies with 1,002 postmenopausal women. All studies tested vaginal oestrogen added to another treatment. - 3 studies compared adding vaginal oestrogen to a pessary versus pessary alone. - 11 studies compared adding vaginal oestrogen to surgery versus surgery alone. No study tested oestrogen by itself against no treatment, pelvic floor muscle training, pessary alone, or surgery alone. Reports gave limited detail about duration, location, and funding.\n\nHow strong is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Many studies were small and varied. People and clinicians may have known which treatment was given, which can cause bias (flaws in study design or conduct that can favor one result). Many outcomes we wanted were not reported. This limits how much we can trust the findings.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nWe need larger, well-designed trials. Researchers should test oestrogen alone and combined with pelvic floor muscle training, pessaries, or surgery. Trials should measure symptoms, quality of life, unwanted effects (adverse events), and costs. Trials should follow women for longer and report key outcomes clearly.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
