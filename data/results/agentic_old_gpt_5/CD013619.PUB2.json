  "text": "Title: Does letting family members stay during resuscitation (emergency efforts to revive someone whose heart or breathing has stopped) reduce stress and trauma symptoms in relatives?\n\nKey messages\n- We found only 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (a study that randomly assigns people or groups to a treatment or control group to fairly compare outcomes). The evidence is very low confidence. One trial suggested family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) (letting relatives be at the patient’s side while emergency treatment is happening) might reduce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (an anxiety disorder after a life-threatening event that causes upsetting memories and severe distress), anxiety (feelings of fear or unease), depression (ongoing low mood that affects daily life), and complicated grief (long-lasting, intense grief that disrupts daily life) up to 12 months. Important study limitations make this uncertain.\n- We do not know whether FPDR changes patient outcomes such as recovery or death (mortality) (the number of deaths in a group over time) or illness and recovery (morbidity) (the number of people who develop disease or health problems). The studies suggest FPDR may have little to no effect on how long cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (an emergency procedure of chest compressions and rescue breaths to restart heartbeat and breathing) lasts and on personal stress in healthcare staff, but we are very uncertain.\n- We need more large, well-designed trials in different settings to confirm benefits, check for harms, and measure effects on patient care and staff. Current evidence is limited because there are very few studies and they have important design problems (risk of bias) (flaws in study design or conduct that can favour one result).\n\nWhat is resuscitation and why might family presence matter?\nResuscitation means emergency care to try to restart a person’s heart or breathing (emergency efforts to revive someone whose heart or breathing has stopped). A common form is CPR (an emergency procedure using chest compressions and breaths to keep blood and oxygen moving).\nRelatives may want to stay to support the patient, see what is happening, and ensure wishes are respected. Clinical teams need space to work quickly and safely. These moments cause high stress (the body’s response to pressure that can cause anxiety and physical symptoms). That is why deciding about family presence is difficult.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation (FPDR)?\nFPDR means offering relatives the choice (an option) to be at the patient’s side during emergency treatment. FPDR affects three groups: the patient, the relatives, and the healthcare team. It may help families emotionally. It could also increase distress for relatives or add stress for staff. It could change how treatment is done.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked whether offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation affects relatives’ mental health after the event, especially PTSD symptoms. We also looked at anxiety, depression, and complicated grief. We asked whether FPDR changes patient outcomes such as morbidity (illness or health problems) and mortality (death). We also examined impacts on the care given and on staff stress and attitudes.\n\nHow we did the review\nWe searched multiple databases (large collections of research articles), trial registries (public lists of clinical studies), and grey sources (reports and papers not published in journals). We looked for studies that compared offering the choice of FPDR with usual care. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (studies that randomly assign participants to compare treatments).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 2 RCTs (reported in 3 papers) with 595 participants. One was a cluster-randomized trial (a study that randomly assigns groups, such as ambulance teams, rather than individuals) in France, done in pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS) (ambulance and paramedic care before reaching the hospital). The other was a small emergency department pilot study (a small study done to test a process before a larger study) in the UK. Relatives were offered FPDR and compared with usual practice without a standard offer.\nWe do not know whether FPDR changes PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, or ongoing grief. One trial showed possible reductions up to 12 months, but study limitations make us unsure. We do not know whether FPDR affects patient recovery or death. FPDR may have little to no effect on CPR duration and on staff personal stress, but we are very uncertain.\n\nLimitations\nOnly 2 trials exist. People in the studies may have known which group they were in. Not all outcomes were reported. These factors raise the risk of bias (flaws that can favour one result). This lowers our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat this means\nWe cannot be sure whether offering FPDR helps or harms relatives. We need more large, well-run trials in different places to answer these questions.\n\nCurrency\nSearches are up to date to March 2022.",
