  "text": "Title\nDoes using a nasal balloon to blow air into the nose (autoinflation; a self-help method where a child blows through the nose to push air into the middle ear and open the Eustachian tube) help clear glue ear (otitis media with effusion, OME; a buildup of fluid behind the eardrum) in children compared with no treatment (watchful waiting; closely watching without giving treatment)?\n\nKey messages\n- Autoinflation may give small short-term benefits for children with glue ear (improving ear-related quality of life; how someone feels and functions day to day). The evidence is low or very low certainty (GRADE; a system to rate how trustworthy evidence is). We are not sure if it helps hearing return to normal.\n- Studies mainly included children aged 3 to 11. They used a nasal balloon or similar device (an object with a specific use) 2 to 3 times a day for 2 to 12 weeks. Some children had ear pain (otalgia; earache). Other unwanted effects were rarely reported.\n\nWhat is glue ear and why does it matter?\nGlue ear (otitis media with effusion, OME) is fluid in the middle ear (the air-filled space behind the eardrum that helps carry sound). The Eustachian tube (a small passage that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and helps drain fluid and equalize pressure) may not open properly. This lets fluid collect. Glue ear often clears on its own. If fluid stays, a child may hear less. Lower hearing can affect speech, language, listening, behaviour, and learning.\n\nHow is glue ear usually managed and what is autoinflation?\nClinicians may use watchful waiting (closely watching without giving treatment), medicines, or surgery. Surgery can include ventilation tubes or grommets (tiny tubes placed in the eardrum to let air into the middle ear). Autoinflation is a non-surgical, at-home technique. A child blows into a nasal balloon or uses a handheld device to push air through the nose. This can create brief pressure that may open the Eustachian tube and help fluid clear. Parents usually learn the technique from a health professional.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if autoinflation helps children with glue ear. We focused on outcomes that matter to families: hearing, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), pain or discomfort, and whether fluid in the middle ear stayed.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for trials (randomised controlled trials; studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments) and similar studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment (watchful waiting). We combined results when possible. We rated how certain the evidence is using GRADE (a system to judge how trustworthy scientific evidence is).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 11 trials with 1,036 children, mostly age 3 to 11. Trials were in Europe and North America. All compared autoinflation with no treatment. Children usually did the technique 2 to 3 times a day for 2 to 12 weeks. Follow-up (monitoring after treatment) was short, up to about 3 months.\n- Autoinflation may slightly reduce how many children still have fluid after about 3 months. This is low-certainty evidence.\n- Autoinflation may improve ear-related quality of life in the short term. This finding comes from 1 study and is low-certainty evidence.\n- We do not know if autoinflation helps hearing return to normal. The evidence about hearing is very uncertain.\n- A small number of children had ear pain (otalgia). We are very uncertain about how often this happened. Other unwanted effects were rarely reported.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- Trials were short, so we do not know long-term effects.\n- Most trials included children old enough to cooperate. We do not know how well autoinflation works in very young children.\n- Studies used different people and methods. People may have known which group they were in. These issues lower our confidence in the results.\n\nHow should families and clinicians use this information?\n- Weigh any small short-term benefit against the need to do the technique regularly and the chance of ear pain.\n- Autoinflation is non-surgical and low risk, but it may not help hearing and the benefit may be small.\n\nWhat should research do next?\nWe need larger, well-designed trials with longer follow-up to measure effects on hearing, daily life, and unwanted effects. Trials should record ear pain and any eardrum problems and check how acceptable the technique is for families.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
