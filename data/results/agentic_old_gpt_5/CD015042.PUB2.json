The studies did not report unwanted effects (adverse events: any health problem that happens during a study). We found no studies of medicines (drugs used to treat conditions), so we cannot say if any medicines help or are safe.\n- The evidence is limited and uncertain. Most studies tested brief interventions (short counseling sessions) and checked outcomes after 8 to 24 weeks. These interventions probably make little or no difference to how many people stay in the program (retention in treatment: the number who stay until the end). Effects on how much people drink when they do drink (drinks per drinking day: average number of drinks on days when someone drinks) are unclear.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol in pregnancy a concern?\nAlcohol can harm the developing baby and affect the health of the pregnant person. Many services advise avoiding alcohol during pregnancy. About 10% of pregnant women worldwide drink alcohol, and rates can reach 25% in parts of Europe. People often need help to stop or cut down.\n\nWhat kinds of help are available to reduce or stop drinking during pregnancy?\nHelp can be non-drug or drug-based. Non-drug help is called psychosocial intervention (see above). These include brief advice, counseling, or motivational conversations. Some people have alcohol use disorder (AUD: a medical condition in which it is hard to control drinking and drinking causes problems). Outside pregnancy, medicines (medication: drugs used to treat conditions) can treat AUD, but safety in pregnancy is uncertain. This review looked at both psychosocial interventions and medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if psychosocial interventions and medicines help pregnant women stop drinking or reduce how much they drink. We also wanted to know if these approaches improve retention in treatment (see above) and whether they cause unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies in pregnant women that compared psychosocial or medication approaches with usual care (see above) or other approaches. We combined results for continuous abstinence (no drinking at all during the study), drinking reduction, retention in treatment, and unwanted effects. We rated how confident we are in the findings using GRADE (certainty of the evidence: an overall rating of how confident we are that the research findings are correct).\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 randomised studies (randomised controlled trials: people are randomly assigned to different treatments) with 1,369 pregnant women who reported drinking. Six studies were in the USA, 1 in Spain, and 1 in the Netherlands. All tested brief psychosocial approaches (short counseling sessions). No study tested medicines.\n\nSessions ranged from a single 10–60 minute visit to up to five 10-minute visits. Most were given around the end of the first trimester (first 3 months of pregnancy). Alcohol use was checked again 8 to 24 weeks later. Control groups (the groups that did not receive the new treatment) had usual care or assessment and advice (assessment: a process to learn about a person’s condition).\n\nCompared with usual care, brief counseling and support may increase the number of women who remain continuously abstinent (continuous abstinence: no drinking at all during the period studied), but the certainty is low. These interventions probably make little or no difference to retention in treatment. Effects on drinks per drinking day are very uncertain. This uncertainty comes from imprecision (uncertainty because there were few participants or wide result ranges) and possible bias (flaws in study design or conduct that can skew results). No study reported unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nLimitations\n- We have low confidence in the evidence because participants and staff may have known which treatment was given. This raises risk of bias.\n- Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. There were few studies and some had few participants, which increases imprecision.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.\n\nWhat this means for patients and clinicians\n- Brief psychosocial interventions may help some pregnant women stop drinking. We do not know if they help people drink less on drinking days. We cannot recommend medicines because no studies tested them. Future studies should test medicines, report unwanted effects, use clear measures (for example, drinks per drinking day), and follow mothers and babies for longer.",
