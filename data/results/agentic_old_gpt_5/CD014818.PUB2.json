  "text": "Title: Which nerve blocks (numbing injections near the nerves) work best and are safest for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- In 39 randomized trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments), the four common nerve blocks—paravertebral block (PVB: a numbing injection placed next to the spinal nerves in the chest), erector spinae plane block (ESPB: a numbing injection given alongside the back muscles near the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC: a numbing injection around the nerves between the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB: a numbing injection along the side of the chest near the armpit)—gave similar pain relief after breast cancer (cancer that forms in tissues of the breast) surgery.\n- Any early benefit for PEC was small and unlikely to matter to most patients. Harms from the blocks were rarely reported; 3 studies recorded no events, so we cannot be sure about safety.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery important?\nMany women have pain in the hours and days after breast cancer surgery. Pain can make it hard to breathe deeply, move the arm and shoulder, sleep, and return to normal activities. Good pain control helps people feel more comfortable and move sooner. It may also lower the chance that short-term pain turns into long-lasting pain.\n\nWhat are regional nerve blocks for breast surgery pain?\nWe use regional analgesia (pain control that numbs a specific area of the body by blocking nerves) to reduce pain. A clinician injects a local anesthetic (a medicine that prevents feeling in part of the body) near the nerves. Clinicians often use ultrasound guidance (using an ultrasound scanner to see inside the body and guide needle placement) to place the needle. These blocks can lower the need for opioids (a class of drugs used to reduce moderate to severe pain) after surgery.\n\nThe main blocks studied were:\n- PVB (paravertebral block): numbing injection next to the spine to block nerves from the chest.\n- ESPB (erector spinae plane block): numbing injection along the back muscles near the spine.\n- PEC (pectoral nerve block): numbing injection around the nerves between chest muscles.\n- SAPB (serratus anterior plane block): numbing injection along the side of the chest near the serratus muscle.\n\nThese procedures can have rare harms. Reported risks include infection (growth of germs in the body), pneumothorax (air that can cause a lung to collapse), nerve injury (damage to a nerve), bleeding, or local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST: a rare serious reaction when numbing medicine gets into the bloodstream).\n\nWhat did this review want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which block gives the best pain relief and how benefits compare with harms. We looked at pain scores on a 0–10 numeric rating scale (a simple 0–10 scale where patients rate their pain), pain at rest and with movement, time to first analgesic request (how long until a patient first needs pain medicine), how much opioid or NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen) people used, quality of recovery (how well people feel and function after surgery), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (feeling sick and/or throwing up after surgery). We also checked for complications linked to the blocks.\n\nHow we did the review\nWe searched international databases to June 2023 for randomized trials. We included trials that compared PVB, ESPB, PEC, or SAPB. Most trials used a single-shot long-acting anesthetic (a one-time injection of numbing medicine meant to last many hours). We combined results across trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 39 randomized trials with 2,348 women. Most had modified radical mastectomy (surgery to remove the whole breast and most lymph nodes under the arm) under general anesthesia (medicines that make you unconscious for surgery). Trials ran from 2013 to 2023 and took place in several countries.\n\nOverall, the four blocks gave similar pain relief in the first 48 hours after surgery. PEC reduced pain slightly at rest at 2 hours and at 24 hours compared with PVB, but the differences were small and unlikely to matter to patients. Pain during movement at 2 hours may be lower with PEC than with PVB, but the certainty is low. By 24 hours, movement pain was similar across techniques. ESPB and SAPB generally matched PVB for pain at 2 and 24 hours. Evidence beyond 24 hours was very limited and uncertain.\n\nOnly 3 studies reported complications and they recorded no events. Because harms were rarely reported, we cannot be confident about safety differences between blocks.\n\nHow certain are we?\nOur confidence in the evidence ranged from high to very low. Many trials were small. Trials varied in methods and in the people studied. These issues reduce certainty.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nWe need larger, well-designed trials that compare the blocks directly. Trials should follow people for longer and report outcomes that matter to patients consistently, including pain with movement and at rest, opioid use, postoperative nausea and vomiting, quality of recovery, and rare but serious harms (nerve injury, pneumothorax, infection, bleeding, or LAST).\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
