  "text": "Title\nDo self-management programs (programs that teach people skills and strategies to manage their vision loss day to day, stay active in daily life, and cope emotionally) help adults with vision loss live better compared with the care people usually get (usual care means the care a provider would normally give)?\n\nKey messages\n- Overall, self-management programs probably make little to no difference to quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). This includes health-related quality of life (HRQoL: how a person’s health affects their physical, mental, and social well-being) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL: how vision problems affect everyday tasks and participation). Unwanted effects (adverse events: unwanted events that cause harm) were rarely reported and appeared similar to usual care.\n- Most studies involved older adults with age-related macular degeneration (a condition in which cells in the centre of the retina break down and reduce central vision). No trials included people with dual sensory impairment (combined loss of vision and hearing). Study methods and programs varied a lot (heterogeneity: real differences between studies), so we cannot say which program parts help which people.\n- We need better research. Future trials should be larger and well designed, use more sensitive measures (able to detect small changes) of quality of life, follow people for longer, report harms (adverse events) and costs consistently, and include people at different stages of vision loss and those with dual sensory impairment.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is visual impairment (reduced vision that cannot be fully corrected with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery and that affects daily activities) and why does it matter?\nVisual impairment is common, especially in older adults. It often comes from eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD: slow breakdown of cells in the centre of the retina), glaucoma, or diabetic eye disease. Over 2.2 billion people worldwide live with some form of vision loss. Vision loss makes everyday tasks harder, such as reading, cooking, getting around safely, and recognising faces. This reduces independence and can harm mental health and overall well-being (a person’s sense of health, comfort, and life satisfaction).\n\nWhat are self-management programs for people with low vision?\nSelf-management programs are structured supports that teach problem-solving, goal setting, use of assistive devices, and ways to adapt the home and routines. They may include emotional coping strategies for stress or low mood. Programs can be one-to-one or group-based and often combine several parts (a multifaceted intervention: several components delivered together). Examples used in studies include optical aids (devices such as magnifiers and special lenses) and low-vision rehabilitation (services that help people make the most of remaining vision and adapt daily activities).\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know if self-management programs improve quality of life compared with no extra support (wait-list control: a group that does not receive the intervention during the study but may receive it after) or with usual care or other active supports (active control: a comparison group that receives another established treatment). We also asked whether programs change day-to-day vision-related performance (tests or questionnaires that assess how well people do tasks that rely on vision) and whether they cause harms (adverse events).\n\nMethods\nWe searched multiple databases and trial registries to May 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies where people are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups). We combined results when possible using meta-analysis (a method that pools results from several studies). We rated how certain the evidence is using GRADE (a system for rating how confident we are in the evidence).\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 randomized studies with 3,151 adults with acquired visual impairment (vision loss that developed after birth). Study sizes ranged from 30 to 323 people (median 153). Studies took place in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults (average ages 60 to 84). Age-related macular degeneration was the most common cause. No trial included people with dual sensory impairment.\n\nAcross the studies, self-management programs may make little to no difference to overall quality of life and to vision-related quality of life. This result held at follow-up times up to 24 months (end of follow-up: the final time point when outcomes are measured). Few adverse events were reported and they appeared similar between groups. Overall, our confidence in these results is low (certainty of evidence: low) because trials differed in who they included and how they delivered the programs (heterogeneity).\n\nLimitations\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. Trials varied in participants, program content, and comparison groups. This variation makes it hard to be sure about benefits or harms. Many studies did not report harms or costs consistently.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",
