Compared with transobturator slings (a mid‑urethral sling passed through small cuts in the groin), single‑incision slings may cause less ongoing pain at about 24 months, and they had similar or fewer mesh exposures and probably slightly fewer early problems emptying the bladder. Compared with retropubic slings (a mid‑urethral sling passed behind the pubic bone through small abdominal cuts), harms were unclear. Evidence was too limited to compare single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings (a sling made from the patient’s own tissue).\n- No trials compared single‑incision slings with no treatment (no additional intervention), conservative care (non‑surgical options such as pelvic floor muscle training: exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor), or non‑mesh operations (for example, colposuspension: surgery that lifts tissues near the bladder to improve support, or laparoscopic procedures: keyhole surgery done through small cuts using a camera). Longer‑term safety and benefits beyond 1 to 2 years remain unclear. Future research should follow women longer, use standard outcomes that matter to patients (pain, pain during sex, daily wellbeing, need for repeat surgery, and mesh problems), compare mesh and non‑mesh options, and include costs and cost‑effectiveness analyses (studies that compare costs and health benefits to see value for money).\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nStress urinary incontinence is involuntary urine leakage during actions that put pressure on the bladder, such as coughing, laughing, exercising, or lifting. It is common in women. It can affect daily life, work, relationships, and emotional wellbeing. It also causes costs for people and health services, for example buying pads and extra laundry.\n\nWhat are sling operations, and what is a single‑incision sling?\nSling operations aim to stop leaks by supporting the middle part of the urethra (the tube through which urine leaves the body). Mid‑urethral slings often use polypropylene mesh (a strong, plastic net‑like material). A single‑incision sling uses a short strip of mesh placed through one small cut in the vaginal wall. This is a minimally invasive procedure (done through small cuts with less tissue damage). Other slings use different routes: transobturator slings pass through small groin cuts, and retropubic slings pass behind the pubic bone through small abdominal cuts. An autologous fascial sling uses a strip of the woman’s own tissue instead of mesh.\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well single‑incision slings work and how safe they are for women with stress urinary incontinence or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. We compared single‑incision slings with transobturator, retropubic, and autologous fascial slings. We focused on outcomes that matter to women: whether leakage improves or stops (based on patient reports), pain (including long‑term pain), pain during sex (dyspareunia), mesh problems (exposure, extrusion, or erosion: mesh pushing out or wearing through nearby tissue), trouble emptying the bladder, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), and the need for further surgery.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials (studies where people are assigned to treatments randomly or by a non‑random method) and economic evaluations up to 20 September 2022. We combined and summarized results on benefits, harms, quality of life, need for further surgery, and costs. We rated how certain the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 62 trials with 8,051 women. Of these, 51 trials compared single‑incision slings with transobturator slings, 10 compared them with retropubic slings, and 1 compared them with an autologous fascial sling. Sixteen trials used TVT‑Secur (a brand of single‑incision device later withdrawn in 2013); we analyzed these separately and they did not change our main conclusions. Most trials reported results at about 12 months. Some reported outcomes at 24 months or longer, but long‑term data were limited.\n\nMain results\n- At about 12 months, single‑incision slings worked as well as transobturator slings for improving or curing leakage (high‑certainty evidence).\n- Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably caused less ongoing patient‑reported pain at about 24 months, had similar numbers of mesh problems, and probably caused slightly fewer early problems emptying the bladder. Effects on quality of life and the need for further surgery were uncertain.\n- Compared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings may make little or no difference to symptom improvement at 12 months. Harms and need for further surgery were uncertain. Pain outcomes were not reported.\n- Evidence comparing single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings was very limited and uncertain.\n- No trials compared single‑incision slings with no treatment, conservative care, or non‑mesh operations.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in most findings. Many studies did not hide which treatment participants received. Not all studies reported all outcomes. Studies used different methods and patients. Few long‑term data exist.\n\nWhat does this mean for women?\nSingle‑incision slings are an option that seems to work about as well as transobturator slings in the short term. Women and clinicians should weigh benefits and harms, including possible mesh problems and the lack of long‑term evidence. We need longer and better trials that compare mesh and non‑mesh options and report outcomes that matter to women.",
