These benefits mainly improve quality of life (how well people feel and function day to day) and reduce symptoms of depression (ongoing low mood) and anxiety (feelings of fear, dread, or worry). They probably make little to no difference to disease activity (how active the bowel inflammation and symptoms are, measured by symptoms or medical tests).\n- In children and adolescents, evidence is less certain. Multimodular psychotherapy (a programme that combines several elements such as talk therapy, education, and relaxation) probably improves quality of life. Effects on depression, anxiety, and disease activity are unclear. Studies did not report unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Future studies should be larger, run longer follow-up (the period after treatment when people are checked), clearly describe combined programmes, consistently measure disease activity, report any harms, and include more children and adolescents.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why might mental health support help?\n- We looked at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (a long-term digestive condition that causes gut inflammation and includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). IBD can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, tiredness, and weight loss. It can disrupt work, school, social life, and sleep.\n- Many people with IBD have depression or anxiety. These mood problems can make daily life harder and may affect how people feel physically. We thought mental health support might improve quality of life (how well people feel and function day to day) and mood, and might possibly change disease activity (how active the bowel inflammation and symptoms are).\n\nWhat are psychological interventions for IBD?\n- We reviewed psychological interventions (treatments that focus on how the mind works and how thoughts and feelings affect behaviour; non-drug supports). These included:\n- Psychotherapy (talk therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy that teaches coping skills).\n- Patient education (structured programmes that teach people about IBD and self-care).\n- Relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, mindfulness, or muscle relaxation to reduce stress).\n- These interventions were given alone or together, in groups or one-to-one, and sometimes online. Key outcomes were quality of life, depression, anxiety, and disease activity.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to know whether psychological interventions help people with IBD. We focused on effects on quality of life, emotional health (depression and anxiety), and disease activity. We looked at adults, children, and adolescents. We compared psychological interventions with care as usual (the routine care people normally get), sham (a fake or inactive version of a treatment), or other treatments.\n\nMethods\n- We searched databases, trial registries (public lists of studies), and conference abstracts to May 2023. We included randomized trials (studies where people are assigned by chance to different treatments) with at least 2 months' follow-up. We pooled results across studies and rated how certain we are about the evidence using GRADE (a system for judging certainty of evidence). We checked for bias (flaws in study design that can favour one result) and noted when blinding (keeping people unaware of which treatment was given) was not possible.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 68 randomized trials. Of these, 48 trials (6,111 adults and 294 children/adolescents) had data we could combine. Most trials used multicomponent or multimodular programmes (combined treatments).\n- In adults, psychotherapy, education, and relaxation each probably give small short-term improvements in quality of life and in symptoms of depression and anxiety. These approaches probably make little to no difference to disease activity.\n- In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life. Effects on depression, anxiety, and disease activity are unclear. Evidence for education and relaxation in children is limited.\n\nLimitations\n- We are moderately confident in the evidence. Many trials could not hide who got which treatment, which raises risk of bias. Studies varied in who took part and how interventions were delivered. Many studies were small and did not report all outcomes.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to May 2023.\n\nWe make no medical recommendations. We only summarise the trial evidence.",
