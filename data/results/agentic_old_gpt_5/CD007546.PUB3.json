These results mainly apply to residents with dementia (a condition that affects memory and thinking). We found no studies in home care (care provided in a person’s own home).\n- We found insufficient good-quality evidence that simple staff education (short training to increase knowledge and change attitudes) reduces restraint use. Giving staff regular information about residents’ fall risk (the chance a person will fall) may make little or no difference.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are physical restraints and why are they used in long-term care?\nPhysical restraints are devices or actions that limit movement. Examples are bedrails (bars attached to a bed), belts (straps that keep a person in place), tables fixed to chairs, and tightly fitted sheets. Long-term care means ongoing help with daily activities provided in places like nursing homes or in a person’s own home. Staff sometimes use restraints to try to stop falls (when someone unintentionally comes to rest on the ground) or to stop a person leaving a chair or bed. Many people in long-term care have dementia (a condition that causes loss of memory and thinking). Research shows restraints do not prevent falls well and can cause harm, such as injuries, agitation (being tense or restless), loss of muscle strength, and lower quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day).\n\nWhat approaches might reduce the use of restraints?\n- Organisational interventions (coordinated changes to a facility’s policies, staffing, training, or workflows) aim to change care across the whole home. They often include staff training, appointing champions (staff who promote and support the change), and new policies. A common goal is a least-restraint policy (avoid restraints whenever possible and use safer alternatives first).\n- Simple staff education (short training sessions) aims to increase staff knowledge and improve attitudes.\n- Giving staff regular information about each resident’s fall risk (the chance they will fall) aims to guide care decisions.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which strategies reduce or prevent physical restraints for older people in long-term care, either in care homes or at home. We also looked at safety and wellbeing outcomes: restraint use, falls and fall-related injuries (harm from a fall, like broken bones), agitation (being unable to relax and appearing tense or restless), quality of life (how someone feels and functions), use of psychotropic medications (medicines that affect mood and behaviour, such as antipsychotics or sedatives), and any adverse events (unwanted harms).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that tested ways to reduce or prevent restraints in long-term care. We included studies that reported on restraint use, falls, wellbeing, and medicine use. We combined results when possible and judged how certain the evidence is.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 11 studies with 19,003 older people. All took place in care homes; we found no studies in home care. Ten were randomised studies (people or groups were randomly assigned to different treatments). One was a controlled clinical trial (compared groups without random assignment). All studies mainly included people with dementia. The average age was about 85 years. Four studies tested organisational programmes to start a least-restraint policy. Six tested simple staff education. One gave staff regular fall-risk information. Most comparison groups received usual care (the care normally given). The abstracts did not report study durations or funding. Reporting of adverse events was limited.\n\nMain results\n- Organisational least-restraint programmes probably reduce how many residents experience any physical restraint and probably cut the use of belts a lot. They probably shorten how long restraints are used (duration of restraint use = the length of time a restraint is applied). These programmes probably make little or no difference to use of psychotropic medications, falls, fall-related injuries, or agitation. One study found little or no change in quality of life. Serious adverse events (major harms such as death or hospitalization) were rarely reported.\n- For simple staff education, we do not know if it reduces how many residents experience any restraint. It probably makes little or no difference to how often restraints are used or how long they are used. It may make little or no difference to falls, fall-related injuries, or agitation. The effect on psychotropic medication use is very uncertain.\n- Giving staff fall-risk information may make little or no difference to restraint use or to falls.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Studies varied in design and in how they delivered the interventions. People and staff may have known which treatment they received. Studies did not report all outcomes we wanted and reported harms poorly. There are not enough studies to be certain about all outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The searches are up to date to August 2022.",
