  "text": "Title\nIs TENS (a procedure in which mild electric currents are applied to some areas of the skin) safe and effective for relieving period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea: menstrual cramps and lower abdominal pain during periods without other pelvic disease)?\n\nKey messages\n- Studies suggest TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; a procedure in which mild electric currents are applied to some areas of the skin) may reduce period pain compared with placebo (an inactive or “dummy” device that looks the same but does not deliver current) or no treatment (a control group that receives no additional interventions). The evidence is low certainty (our confidence that the findings are close to the truth is limited). Reporting of adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment) was poor, so safety is unclear.\n- We do not know if one TENS setting works better than another. High-frequency TENS (faster pulses felt as a strong tingling without muscle twitching) did not clearly differ from low-frequency TENS (slower pulses that may cause gentle muscle twitches and aim to trigger the body’s natural pain relievers, called endogenous opioids). We also do not know how TENS compares with common oral pain medicines such as paracetamol (also called acetaminophen; a common pain reliever and fever reducer) or NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; pain and anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen), or with non-drug options such as acupressure (pressing on specific points on the body) or interferential current therapy (a pain treatment that uses two crossing electrical currents through the skin).\n- We need larger, well-designed studies to give more reliable results. Future studies should compare TENS settings and TENS with standard treatments. They should measure outcomes that matter to users and record unwanted effects carefully.\n\nWhat is primary period pain and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea (menstrual cramps and lower abdominal pain during periods without other pelvic disease) is common in teenagers and adults. Pain can be mild or severe. For some people it causes missed school or work and limits daily activities (how someone functions day to day).\n\nWhat is TENS and how might it help menstrual cramps?\nTENS uses a small battery-powered device and sticky pads (electrodes: sticky pads placed on the skin that deliver small electrical pulses) on the skin where it hurts. The device sends mild electrical pulses. Pulses may block pain signals to the brain, trigger release of endogenous opioids (natural pain-relief chemicals made by the body), and reduce uterine muscle spasm by improving blood flow. Devices can change how often pulses happen (frequency: how often pulses happen). Because TENS is non-pharmacological (a treatment that does not use medicines), some people prefer it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know how effective (how well a treatment works) and how safe TENS is for primary period pain. We looked for studies that compared TENS with placebo (inactive device), no treatment, other treatments (for example paracetamol, NSAIDs, acupressure, interferential current therapy), and studies that compared different TENS settings.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched many databases and trial registries up to April 2024. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies where people are assigned at random to different treatments). We combined results for pain and for unwanted effects. We judged certainty of evidence (how confident we are that the findings are close to the truth) by looking at study methods, size, and consistency. We checked studies for bias (flaws in study design or conduct that can distort results).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 20 RCTs with 585 women aged 12 to 49.\n- Studies tested high-frequency and low-frequency TENS and compared TENS with placebo, no treatment, each other, and with treatments such as acupressure, paracetamol (acetaminophen), interferential current therapy, and NSAIDs.\n- Both high-frequency and low-frequency TENS may reduce period pain compared with no active treatment. The evidence is low certainty.\n- We do not know if high-frequency TENS is better than low-frequency TENS.\n- It is uncertain whether TENS is better or worse than acupressure or paracetamol. High-frequency TENS may be similar to interferential current therapy for pain relief.\n- Reporting of adverse effects was poor. Few studies reported side effects, so we cannot be sure how TENS compares with no treatment for safety.\n\nHow strong is the evidence?\nOverall, the evidence is low certainty. Studies were small. Methods had problems that may have caused bias. Not all studies measured outcomes that matter to users.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with period pain?\nTENS may help some people with period pain. We cannot be sure how large the benefit is or how safe it is because the evidence is limited. People may wish to try TENS if they prefer non-drug options or cannot take medicines. We recommend discussing TENS with a clinician.\n\nWhat do researchers need to do next?\n- Run larger, well-designed RCTs with enough people.\n- Compare different TENS settings and compare TENS with standard medicines.\n- Measure outcomes that matter to users, such as need for extra pain relief, ability to carry out daily activities, and quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day).\n- Record and report adverse effects and longer-term outcomes clearly.\n\nCurrency of evidence\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence up to April 2024.",
