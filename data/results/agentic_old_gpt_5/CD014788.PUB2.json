  "text": "Title: Do gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) medicines help relieve pain from endometriosis (when tissue like the lining of the womb grows outside the womb), and what side effects do they have, including bone thinning?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on limited, low-certainty studies, GnRH medicines (GnRH is a brain hormone that tells the ovaries to make oestrogen and progesterone; GnRH medicines are lab-made drugs that lower ovarian oestrogen) may reduce endometriosis pain in the short term compared with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment with no active medicine). They may also cause more unwanted effects (adverse effects: harmful or unwanted effects) such as hot flushes (sudden feelings of heat, sweating) and reduced bone mineral density (BMD: a measure of minerals in bone; lower BMD means thinner, weaker bones).\n- Adding small doses of hormone (add-back therapy: giving back low hormone doses during GnRH treatment) or using calcium-regulating agents (medicines or supplements such as calcium and vitamin D that help keep bones strong) may reduce bone loss, but the evidence is weak. Few trials reported quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) or patient satisfaction. We found no trials comparing GnRH medicines with simple painkillers (analgesics: pain-relieving medicines) or with no treatment.\n- Most trials were small, short term, and had flaws (bias: problems in study design or conduct). We are not confident in the results. Future trials should be larger, last longer, compare GnRH with key alternatives (progestogens: hormones like progesterone; danazol: an older synthetic hormone; and intra-uterine progestogen devices such as a hormonal IUD that slowly releases hormone in the womb), and monitor bone health.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and why is it a problem?\nEndometriosis is a condition where tissue like the lining of the womb grows outside the womb. This can cause inflammation, scarring, and pain. It affects about 6 to 11 out of every 100 women of reproductive age. Common symptoms include painful periods (dysmenorrhoea: painful menstrual periods), pain during sex (dyspareunia: pain with sexual intercourse), pelvic pain (pain in the area between the hip bones), and sometimes trouble getting pregnant. Endometriosis can make daily life and wellbeing worse.\n\nWhat are GnRH analogues and how might they help?\nGnRH analogues (GnRHas) are medicines that act like the natural brain hormone GnRH (a hormone that tells the ovaries to make oestrogen and progesterone). GnRHas lower oestrogen and create a short-term, menopause-like state. This can shrink or calm endometriosis tissue and ease pain. Lowering oestrogen can cause hot flushes and a drop in BMD. Add-back therapy (small hormone doses given with GnRHa) can reduce these side effects. Calcium-regulating agents (such as calcium and vitamin D) may also help protect bones.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well GnRHas relieve pain from endometriosis and how safe they are. We compared GnRHas with placebo, with other hormone medicines (for example, progestogens, danazol, gestrinone: a synthetic hormone used in some countries), with intra-uterine progestogen devices (hormonal IUDs), and with GnRHas plus add-back or bone-protective medicines. We looked at pain, quality of life, the most troublesome symptom, overall satisfaction, side effects, and BMD.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries up to May 2022 for randomized studies (trials where people are randomly assigned to treatment groups). We included 72 randomized studies with 7,355 women. We extracted results on pain, quality of life, adverse effects, and BMD. We rated our confidence in the evidence, giving more weight to better-conducted trials.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Compared with placebo and with oral or injectable progestogens, GnRHas may reduce pain slightly at 3–6 months. The effect was small. Evidence certainty was low or very low.\n- It is unclear whether GnRHas work better or worse than danazol, gestrinone, or intra-uterine progestogens for pain. No low-bias trials compared GnRHas with intra-uterine progestogen devices.\n- GnRHas increase unwanted effects such as hot flushes compared with placebo or gestrinone.\n- GnRHas may reduce BMD during treatment compared with some alternatives. Bone loss may be greater when GnRHas are used without bone-protective medicines.\n- Few trials reported quality of life or patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat are the main limitations of the evidence?\n- Many trials were small, short term (pain usually measured at 3–6 months; bone up to 12 months), and poorly reported.\n- Many trials had possible bias (flaws in design, conduct, or analysis). This lowers our confidence in the findings.\n- We found no trials comparing GnRHas with analgesics (painkillers) or with no treatment.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with endometriosis?\n- GnRHas may ease pain in the short term but often cause hot flushes and can thin bones while taken.\n- Add-back therapy or calcium and vitamin D might reduce bone loss, but the evidence is weak.\n- We need larger, longer, and better-designed trials that compare GnRHas with key alternatives and monitor bone health during and after treatment.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022.",
