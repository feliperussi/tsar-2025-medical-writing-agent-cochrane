PCNL may also reduce the need for more procedures later.\n\n– PCNL probably makes little difference to the risk of major problems after surgery compared to RIRS, but it may mean people have to stay in the hospital for about one day longer.\n\n– We do not know how these two surgeries affect people's quality of life or their need for unplanned medical visits, as the studies did not report this. Future, better-quality studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and harms of each surgery.\n\n**What are kidney stones?**\n\nKidney stones are hard lumps that can form in the kidneys. They are very common and can cause severe pain, blockages, and infections. Treatment for kidney stones depends on their size and where they are located. While some small stones pass on their own, larger stones often need to be removed with a procedure or surgery.\n\n**What are PCNL and RIRS?**\n\nPCNL and RIRS are two common types of surgery to remove kidney stones.\n\n– **Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)** is a type of 'keyhole' surgery. A surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and passes a thin tube through to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\n– **Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS)** does not involve any cuts in the skin. A surgeon passes a very thin, flexible tube with a camera through the body's natural urinary passages (from the bladder up to the kidney). The stone is then broken up with a laser, and the pieces are removed or passed naturally in the urine.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out which surgery, PCNL or RIRS, is better for treating kidney stones in adults. We were interested in how well each surgery removed the stones, and their risks, such as major problems after surgery, the need for more procedures, and the length of hospital stay.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared PCNL with RIRS for treating kidney stones in adults. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 42 studies that included 4571 adults who were randomly assigned to have either PCNL or RIRS. The kidney stones in the studies ranged in size from about 1 cm to 4 cm. Most studies did not report where their funding came from.\n\nHere are the main results of our review:\n\n**Being free of stones after surgery**\nPeople who have PCNL may be more likely to be completely free of stones after surgery compared to people who have RIRS. If 770 out of 1000 people become stone-free after RIRS, we would expect about 870 people to become stone-free after PCNL.\n\n**Major problems after surgery**\nPCNL probably makes little or no difference to the risk of having major problems after surgery compared with RIRS.\n\n**Needing another procedure**\nPeople who have PCNL may be much less likely to need another procedure to remove leftover stone pieces. If 222 out of 1000 people need another procedure after RIRS, we would expect only about 69 people to need one after PCNL.\n\n**Length of hospital stay**\nPeople who have PCNL may stay in the hospital longer than people who have RIRS, by about one day on average.\n\n**Other unwanted effects**\nPCNL may have little or no effect on the risk of developing a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney.\n\nThe studies did not provide any information about unplanned medical visits or people's quality of life after surgery.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for most of our findings. This is because many of the studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, it is possible that people were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, many studies did not provide detailed results about everything we were interested in.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
