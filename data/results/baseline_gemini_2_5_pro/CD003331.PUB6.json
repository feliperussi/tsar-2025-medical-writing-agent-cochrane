It does not mean the heart has stopped working. People with heart failure often feel tired, breathless, and find it hard to exercise. This can affect their quality of life and lead to frequent hospital stays.\n\nThere are different types of heart failure. One common type is when the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood properly. Another type is when the heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot fill with enough blood.\n\n**What is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation?**\n\nExercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of structured exercise sessions designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health. These programs are often called 'cardiac rehab'. They can include just exercise, or they can be part of a wider program that also includes education and psychological support. People can attend these programs at a hospital or center, or they can do them at home.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps adults with heart failure. We were interested in its effects on:\n\n– death from any cause;\n– being admitted to the hospital;\n– quality of life.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation with usual care that did not include a formal exercise program. The studies had to follow people for at least 6 months.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 people with heart failure. Most studies followed people for about 6 months. The studies included people with both weak and stiff heart muscles. They looked at exercise programs delivered in different ways, such as in a center, at home, or with digital support.\n\nCompared to usual care without a formal exercise program, we found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation:\n\n– **probably reduces** the number of people admitted to the hospital for any reason.\n– **probably reduces** the number of people admitted to the hospital specifically because of their heart failure.\n– **probably improves** quality of life. People reported important improvements in how heart failure affected their daily lives.\n– **may make little to no difference** to the risk of death from any cause within the first year.\n\nThe benefits of exercise programs seemed to be similar whether they were done at home or in a center, and whether they included only exercise or were part of a more comprehensive program.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for most findings. This is because some studies were small, and we had some concerns about how they were carried out. This means that future research could change our conclusions. We have little confidence in the evidence for the risk of death, so we cannot be certain about this result.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
