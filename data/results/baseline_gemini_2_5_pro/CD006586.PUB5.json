However, these pills may also cause more unwanted side effects, such as breast pain, nausea, and bleeding between periods, compared to a dummy pill (placebo).\n\n- We did not find any studies that compared these pills with other types of birth control pills. We also do not know if they work for longer than three months or if they help women with milder PMS symptoms.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?\n\nPremenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a common condition that can affect women in the days or weeks before their period. Symptoms can be physical, like bloating and headaches, or emotional, like mood swings and feeling irritable.\n\nFor some women, these symptoms can be very severe and interfere with their daily life, work, and relationships. This severe form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\n\nHow can birth control pills help?\n\nCombined birth control pills contain two types of hormones (oestrogen and progestin) that stop pregnancy. Because they affect hormone levels, they are sometimes used to help manage the symptoms of PMS. One type of birth control pill contains a specific progestin hormone called drospirenone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if birth control pills containing drospirenone are helpful and safe for women with PMS. We looked at how they compared to a dummy pill (a placebo, which has no medicine in it) or to other types of birth control pills.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared birth control pills containing drospirenone with a placebo or with other birth control pills for women with PMS. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 5 studies that included a total of 858 women. Most of the women in these studies had the severe form of PMS called PMDD.\n\nCompared to a dummy pill, we found that birth control pills with drospirenone:\n\n- may reduce overall premenstrual symptoms.\n- may also reduce problems with daily life caused by PMS, such as effects on work, social activities, and relationships.\n- may lead to more unwanted side effects. People taking these pills were more likely to experience side effects like breast pain, feeling sick (nausea), and bleeding between periods.\n- may cause more people to stop treatment because of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe are uncertain about the effect of these pills on mood symptoms.\n\nNo serious or rare side effects, such as harmful blood clots, were reported in the studies.\n\nWe did not find any studies that compared birth control pills with drospirenone to other types of birth control pills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies did not always report their methods clearly, the results from different studies were not always similar, and the studies included a small number of women, which makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
