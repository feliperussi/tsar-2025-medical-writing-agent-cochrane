  "text": "Can combining different treatments help people with cachexia (disease-related wasting)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if combining treatments, such as medicines, nutritional support, and exercise, helps people with cachexia. The available evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot say if these combined treatments improve physical function, strength, appetite, or quality of life. It is also unclear if they cause any unwanted effects.\n\n– The studies we found were small and had weaknesses in how they were carried out.\n\n– We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if combined treatments are helpful and safe for people with cachexia.\n\n**What is cachexia?**\n\nCachexia is a condition also known as disease-related wasting. It can happen to people with long-term (chronic) illnesses like cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS.\n\nPeople with cachexia lose weight and muscle without trying to. They often feel very tired, lose their appetite, and have a lower quality of life. Because cachexia is complex, it is thought that combining different types of treatments might be more helpful than using just one.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using a combination of treatments helps people with cachexia. These combinations could include:\n– medicines\n– nutritional support (like special diets or supplements)\n– exercise programs\n\nWe compared these combined treatments to usual care, a single treatment, or a different combination of treatments. We were interested in their effects on people's physical ability, strength, body weight, and quality of life. We also looked for any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared combined treatments against usual care or single treatments in adults with cachexia. We compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors like how the studies were done and how many people took part.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 926 adults with cachexia. The average age of people in the studies was 63 years. Most studies were done in Europe and included people with cancer. Other studies included people with lung disease, kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe evidence from these studies was very uncertain for all the things we looked at.\n\n**Combined treatments compared with usual care**\nWe do not know if combined treatments have an effect on physical function, strength, body weight, appetite, or tiredness when compared to usual care. It is also unclear if they cause any unwanted effects.\n\n**Combined treatments compared with a single treatment**\nWe do not know if using a combination of treatments is better than using just one treatment. It is unclear if combined treatments have an effect on physical function, strength, body weight, quality of life, or appetite.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence we found. This is because most of the studies were very small, and there were not enough of them for us to be certain about the results. There were also weaknesses in how the studies were carried out, which could have affected their findings. Because of these limitations, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
