Unwanted effects are rare and are usually mild skin reactions.\n- This small benefit was mainly seen in groups of people at high risk of malaria, such as refugees, who did not have access to other prevention methods like insecticide-treated bed nets.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about these findings. More research is needed, especially in high-risk groups, to understand if skin repellents are a useful tool for preventing malaria.\n\n**What is malaria and how is it usually prevented?**\n\nMalaria is a serious illness spread by the bites of infected mosquitoes. It is common in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world.\n\nThe main ways to prevent malaria are using insecticide-treated bed nets (nets treated with medicine that kills mosquitoes) and spraying the inside of homes with insecticides. These methods work well but mainly protect people when they are indoors, especially while sleeping.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nBecause people can still be bitten by mosquitoes when they are outdoors, we wanted to find out if applying insect repellent to the skin helps to prevent malaria.\n\nWe wanted to know if skin repellents work on their own or if they add extra protection for people already using other methods like bed nets. We were especially interested in their effects on people at high risk of getting malaria, like refugees, soldiers, or people who work in forests.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared people using skin repellents with people not using them. We looked for studies that took place in areas where malaria is common. We then collected and combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 8 studies for our review. We combined the results from 6 of these studies, which included over 61,000 people. Some studies took place in refugee camps and included people at high risk of getting malaria.\n\nOur main findings were:\n- Skin repellents may slightly reduce the number of people who get sick with malaria.\n- They may also slightly reduce the number of people who already have malaria at any one time.\n- Skin repellents appear to be safe. Very few people had unwanted effects, which were limited to mild skin reactions.\n\nThe small benefits of skin repellents were mostly seen in studies with high-risk groups who were not using other malaria prevention tools. We are uncertain if skin repellents provide any extra protection for people who are already sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because there were problems with how some of the studies were designed. These problems mean the results might not be reliable, and the true effect of skin repellents could be different from what these studies found.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
