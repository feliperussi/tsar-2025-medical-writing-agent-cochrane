Programs that focus only on diet probably make little to no difference.\n\n– The small benefits seen from these programs do not seem to last in the long term (beyond 15 months). Unwanted effects, like minor injuries, were not well reported in the studies.\n\n– More research is needed to understand how to prevent obesity in children outside of schools, for example, in the home or community. We also need more studies that include children with disabilities.\n\n**What is childhood obesity?**\n\nChildhood obesity is when a child has an unhealthy amount of body fat for their height and age. It is a growing health problem around the world. It can affect a child's health, development, and general well-being, both now and in the future.\n\nTo prevent obesity, programs often try to help children change their behaviour. These programs encourage healthy eating or being more active (for example, doing more physical activity and spending less time sitting down).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if programs that focus on diet, physical activity, or both, can help prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11. We looked at how these programs affected children's weight. We also wanted to know if the programs had any serious unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs with no program or usual care for children. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 172 studies that included a total of 189,707 children. Most of the studies took place in schools in high-income countries. The length of the programs varied from a single session to four years.\n\nWe compared three types of programs to children receiving no program or their usual care.\n\n**Programs focused only on diet**\nCompared to no program, programs that focused only on diet probably make little to no difference to a child's weight.\n\n**Programs focused only on physical activity**\nPrograms that focused only on physical activity probably reduce weight slightly when measured between 9 and 15 months later. However, they may make little to no difference in the shorter term (less than 9 months) or the longer term (more than 15 months).\n\n**Programs focused on both diet and physical activity**\nPrograms that combined both diet and activity probably reduce weight when measured between 9 and 15 months later. The effect may be smaller in the short term and may make little to no difference in the long term.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\nVery few studies reported on unwanted effects. When they were reported, they were usually minor. For example, some studies mentioned ankle sprains from physical activity, stomach discomfort, or behavioural problems.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is mixed. For some findings, it is moderate, but for many, it is low. This is because the results often varied between the different studies, and we could not always explain why.\n\nAlso, most studies were done in schools and did not include children with physical or mental disabilities. This means we know very little about how well these programs work in other places, like in the home or community, or for children with disabilities.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
