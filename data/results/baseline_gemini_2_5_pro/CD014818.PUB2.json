The few studies that looked for unwanted effects did not report any.\n\n– We are not very confident in some of our findings because many of the studies were small. More research is needed to be certain about which nerve block works best and to better understand any possible unwanted effects.\n\n**What is the problem?**\n\nMany people experience pain after surgery for breast cancer. Controlling this pain is important because it helps people feel more comfortable and recover better.\n\nOne way to manage pain after surgery is with injections of numbing medicine near the nerves in the chest area. This is called regional analgesia, or a nerve block. It blocks pain in a specific part of thebody.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if one type of nerve block was better than others for controlling pain after breast cancer surgery. We looked at four different types:\n\n– paravertebral block (PVB)\n– erector spinae plane block (ESPB)\n– pectoral nerve block (PEC)\n– serratus anterior plane block (SAPB)\n\nWe also wanted to learn about any unwanted or harmful effects of these nerve blocks.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these different nerve blocks in women having breast cancer surgery. We then compared and summarized the results from these studies. We also rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 39 studies that included a total of 2348 women. The studies took place in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, and the USA. Most women in the studies were having a type of surgery called a modified radical mastectomy. The nerve blocks were usually given as a single injection using ultrasound to guide the needle.\n\n**Main results**\n\nOverall, all four types of nerve blocks seemed to work similarly well for reducing pain after surgery.\n\nWhen we looked at pain while people were resting, we found that all the nerve blocks provided similar levels of pain relief at 2 hours and 24 hours after surgery. One type of block (PEC) reduced pain slightly more than another (PVB), but this small difference was probably not noticeable to patients.\n\nWhen we looked at pain while people were moving, one type of block (PEC) may reduce pain more than another (PVB) in the first few hours after surgery. For other comparisons, the nerve blocks may provide similar pain relief, but we are uncertain about the results.\n\nOnly a few studies looked for unwanted effects from the nerve blocks. In these studies, no unwanted effects were reported. These included problems like nerve damage, bleeding, or infection where the needle was inserted.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for some of our findings. This is mainly because many of the studies were very small. Also, the results from different studies were not always consistent with each other. For some questions, especially about unwanted effects, there was not enough information for us to be certain.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
