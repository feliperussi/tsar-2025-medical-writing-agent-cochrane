We are not sure if this combination affects the risk of death, how long people stay in the hospital, or a temporary problem where the bowel stops working after surgery. Unwanted effects of the bowel cleaning were not well reported in the studies.\n\n– We do not know if combining laxatives and antibiotics is better or worse than using only antibiotic pills, or doing no bowel cleaning at all. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the results.\n\n– More research is needed to understand the best way to prepare the bowel for surgery. Future studies should compare the different methods and properly record any unwanted effects, like feeling sick or becoming dehydrated.\n\n**What is bowel surgery and why is preparation important?**\n\nPlanned surgery on the large bowel (also called elective colorectal surgery) is a common operation. After removing a piece of the bowel, the surgeon reconnects the two ends.\n\nThe large bowel naturally contains a lot of bacteria. During surgery, these bacteria can cause serious problems like infections in the surgical wound. Another serious problem is when the reconnected part of the bowel leaks. These problems can lead to a longer and more difficult recovery.\n\nTo reduce these risks, doctors may ask people to clean out their bowel before surgery. This can be done in two main ways:\n– Mechanical bowel preparation: using strong laxatives to empty the bowel of all poo.\n– Oral antibiotics: taking antibiotic pills to reduce the number of bacteria in the bowel.\nSometimes, these two methods are used together.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if combining mechanical bowel preparation (laxatives) and oral antibiotics before surgery is better at preventing problems than:\n– using only laxatives;\n– using only antibiotics; or\n– doing no bowel preparation at all.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies where people having planned bowel surgery were randomly put into groups to receive different types of bowel preparation. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 people having planned bowel surgery. The studies took place in countries around the world and used different types of laxatives and antibiotics.\n\n**Combining laxatives and antibiotics compared to using only laxatives**\nWe found 17 studies that compared these two methods. The evidence suggests that combining laxatives and antibiotics:\n– probably reduces the risk of wound infections;\n– probably reduces the risk of the reconnected bowel leaking;\n– probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death or how long people stay in the hospital; and\n– may make little to no difference to the bowel temporarily stopping working after surgery.\n\n**Combining laxatives and antibiotics compared to using only antibiotics**\nWe found 3 studies that compared these two methods. We are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if combining laxatives and antibiotics has an effect on wound infections. The combination may make little to no difference to bowel leakage, death, or the bowel temporarily stopping working.\n\n**Combining laxatives and antibiotics compared to no bowel preparation**\nWe found 1 study that compared these methods. The evidence is very uncertain. We do not know if combining laxatives and antibiotics has an effect on wound infections or death. The combination may make little to no difference to bowel leakage, the bowel temporarily stopping working, or how long people stay in the hospital.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for the main comparison (combined preparation versus laxatives alone). This is because some studies did not provide enough information about how they were conducted.\n\nFor the other comparisons, we have little or no confidence in the evidence. This is because there were not enough studies, and the studies that did exist were too small to be certain about the results. Also, very few studies reported on unwanted effects of the bowel preparation, such as dehydration or feeling sick.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
