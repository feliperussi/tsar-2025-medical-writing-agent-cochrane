A single, small study suggested it might reduce flare-ups and improve breathing, but we are very uncertain about these results. The study did not provide clear information on unwanted effects.\n\n- More and better-quality research is needed. Future studies should test different types of mucus-thinning medicines in more children and for longer periods to find out if they are helpful and safe.\n\n**What is a long-term wet cough in children?**\n\nSome children have long-term lung conditions that cause them to have a wet-sounding cough that lasts for many weeks or months. These conditions are sometimes called chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). This group of conditions includes bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).\n\nIn these conditions, the airways in the lungs can become damaged and inflamed, making it hard to clear out mucus. This can lead to repeated infections and make breathing difficult. Finding effective treatments is a high priority for families and doctors.\n\n**What are mucolytics?**\n\nMucolytics are medicines that work by thinning the mucus in the lungs. This can make the mucus less sticky and easier to cough up. By helping to clear the airways, these medicines might help reduce infections and inflammation. They can be taken as a liquid or tablet, or breathed in as a fine mist using a machine called a nebuliser.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with long-term wet coughs. We were interested in whether these medicines could:\n- reduce the number of flare-ups (times when symptoms get worse);\n- improve children's quality of life;\n- improve how well their lungs work;\n- and whether they caused any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared mucolytics with a pretend treatment (placebo) or no treatment in children with long-term wet coughs. We planned to compare and summarize the results of the studies. We also planned to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found only one small study that met our criteria. The study included 52 children with a lung condition called bronchiectasis. It took place in a hospital outpatient clinic.\n\nThe study compared children who breathed in a mist of salty water (called hypertonic saline) before doing special exercises to clear their lungs (chest physiotherapy). The other group of children only did the chest physiotherapy. Each child was followed for eight weeks.\n\nThe study reported that children using the salty water mist had fewer flare-ups and showed more improvement on breathing tests compared to those who only did chest physiotherapy. The study did not measure quality of life. It reported that no children left the study because of unwanted effects.\n\nHowever, the evidence from this single study is very uncertain. This means we do not know if the salty water mist has an effect on flare-ups or breathing. We also did not find any studies that looked at other types of mucolytics, such as tablets or liquids, or studies that included children with other types of long-term wet coughs.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Our findings are based on only one small study. There were also several problems with how this study was carried out. For example, it is possible that the people in the study knew which treatment they were getting, and not all the results we were interested in were reported. Because of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
