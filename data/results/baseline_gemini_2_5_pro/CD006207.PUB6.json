Wearing medical or surgical masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like illness or a confirmed breathing virus. It is also unclear if special N95/P2 respirator masks work better than medical or surgical masks for healthcare workers.\n\n– Regularly washing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser probably reduces the number of people who get a breathing illness by a small amount.\n\n– The studies we found had problems in their design and people did not always use the measures like masks or hand washing correctly. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. We need more and better studies to understand if these measures work, especially for older people and young children.\n\n**What are breathing viruses and why are they a problem?**\n\nBreathing viruses, also known as respiratory viruses, are germs that can cause infections in your nose, throat, and lungs. These infections can spread easily from person to person when someone coughs, sneezes, or talks.\n\nSometimes, a new virus can spread around the world very quickly, causing a pandemic. Examples include the flu (influenza) and COVID-19. During a pandemic, medicines and vaccines might not be enough to stop the virus from spreading. Because of this, people are often told to use physical measures to protect themselves and others. These include wearing face masks, washing hands, and keeping a distance from other people.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how well these physical measures work to slow down or stop the spread of breathing viruses. This is an update of a review we published in 2020, and it now includes studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared physical measures to no measures, or to other physical measures. The studies had to assign people to different groups by chance (a method called randomisation). We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 78 studies with over 610,000 people. The studies took place in different settings around the world, such as schools, hospitals, and communities. Many studies were done before the COVID-19 pandemic, when fewer breathing viruses were spreading. In many of the studies, people did not always follow the instructions they were given, such as wearing their mask correctly or washing their hands often.\n\n**Face masks**\n– Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like illness or a confirmed breathing virus like COVID-19.\n– We do not know if special, tight-fitting masks called N95/P2 respirators work better than medical or surgical masks to stop people from getting a breathing virus. This is because the evidence is very uncertain.\n– Unwanted effects of wearing masks, like discomfort, were not well reported in the studies.\n\n**Hand washing**\n– Regularly washing hands probably reduces the number of people who get a general breathing illness. For example, if 200 out of 1000 people would normally get sick, regular hand washing could reduce this to about 178 people.\n– Hand washing may make little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like illness or a confirmed case of the flu.\n– Unwanted effects of hand washing were not well reported.\n\n**Other physical measures**\nWe did not find any reliable studies about the effects of wearing gowns and gloves, face shields, or having temperature checks at airports or other entry points.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in these results is low to moderate. This is because there were problems with how some of the studies were designed. The studies also measured results in different ways, which made them hard to compare.\n\nA major issue was that in many studies, people did not use the measures properly. For example, they did not wear masks all the time or did not wash their hands as often as they should have. This makes it hard to know if the measures themselves do not work, or if they just were not used enough to make a difference.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
