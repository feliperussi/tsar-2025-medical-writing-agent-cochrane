  "text": "Can strengthening exercises help people with pain at the front of the knee (patellar tendinopathy)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if strengthening exercises are better than no treatment, steroid injections (glucocorticoids), or surgery for improving pain or knee function in athletes with long-term pain at the front of their knee. This is because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n\n– None of the studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects of the treatments, so we cannot draw any conclusions about their safety.\n\n– The findings of this review only apply to athletes. Future, larger studies are needed to understand the true benefits and risks of strengthening exercises. These studies should also include people who are not athletes.\n\n**What is patellar tendinopathy?**\n\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that causes pain at the front of the knee, just below the kneecap. It happens when the tendon that connects your kneecap to your shinbone gets injured, usually from being overused in activities like jumping or running. For this reason, it is sometimes called 'jumper's knee' and often affects athletes.\n\nThe main treatment for this condition is exercise, especially exercises that strengthen the muscles around the knee. Other treatments that are sometimes used include steroid injections (called glucocorticoid injections) and surgery.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if strengthening exercises help people with patellar tendinopathy. We also wanted to know how these exercises compare to other treatments, like steroid injections or surgery, and if they cause any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, a fake treatment, steroid injections, surgery, or other treatments for patellar tendinopathy. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 7 studies that included a total of 211 people. All the people in the studies were athletes, and most were men (88%) with an average age of 26. On average, they had been experiencing knee pain for over 3 years.\n\nThe studies compared strengthening exercises to:\n– no treatment (3 studies)\n– steroid injections (1 study)\n– surgery (1 study)\n– other treatments like stretching or ultrasound (2 studies)\n\nWe did not find any studies that compared strengthening exercises to a fake (placebo) treatment.\n\n**Main results**\n\n*Strengthening exercises compared to no treatment*\nWe do not know if strengthening exercises have an effect on pain compared to no treatment. Strengthening exercises may make little to no difference to knee function.\n\n*Strengthening exercises compared to steroid injections*\nStrengthening exercises may make little to no difference to pain or knee function when compared to a steroid injection.\n\n*Strengthening exercises compared to surgery*\nWe do not know if strengthening exercises have an effect on pain or knee function compared to surgery. Strengthening exercises may make little to no difference to how successful people felt their treatment was, or to their ability to return to sport.\n\n*Unwanted effects*\nNone of the studies we found reported on unwanted or harmful effects, so we do not know if these treatments are safe.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low to very low. This is mainly because the studies we found were very small. There were also problems with how some of the studies were carried out, which could have affected their results.\n\nA major limitation is that all the studies only included athletes. This means the results may not apply to the general public or people who are less active.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
