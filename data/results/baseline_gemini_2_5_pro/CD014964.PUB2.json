  "text": "Does using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural injections work better than feeling for bony landmarks in adults?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural injections reduces the number of needle pokes needed for success and makes the procedure quicker. It also probably increases the chance of the injection being successful on the first try.\n\n– Using ultrasound may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure or to the chances of the procedure failing completely.\n\n– We do not know if using ultrasound affects pain during the procedure or the risk of other unwanted effects because the evidence is very uncertain. More research is needed to better understand this.\n\n**What is neuraxial anaesthesia?**\n\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief that involves an injection into the back, near the spinal cord. The two most common types are spinal and epidural anaesthesia. These injections numb a large area of the body and are often used during childbirth (for example, caesarean sections) or for surgery on the lower half of the body.\n\nTo give the injection, doctors usually feel for bony parts of the spine (called anatomical landmarks) to find the right place for the needle. However, finding the exact spot can be difficult. If the needle is not in the right place, the procedure may need to be repeated, which can cause discomfort and complications for the patient.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using an ultrasound machine to see inside the back and guide the needle is better than the traditional method of feeling for landmarks.\n\nWe were interested in whether using ultrasound:\n– reduces the number of attempts needed for a successful injection;\n– makes the procedure quicker;\n– improves patient satisfaction;\n– affects the chances of success on the first try;\n– reduces the risk of the procedure failing;\n– reduces pain during the procedure;\n– leads to any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound with using anatomical landmarks to guide neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 65 studies that included a total of 6823 adults. The studies took place in countries all over the world. About half of the people in the studies were pregnant women having an epidural for labour or anaesthesia for a caesarean section. The other half were people having surgery. The studies looked at different types of neuraxial anaesthesia, including spinal, epidural, and a combination of both.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n**Success and procedure time**\nCompared to feeling for landmarks, using ultrasound:\n– reduces the number of attempts needed for a successful injection.\n– reduces the time it takes to perform the injection.\n– probably increases the chance of success on the first attempt.\n\n**Patient experience and unwanted effects**\nCompared to feeling for landmarks, using ultrasound:\n– may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure.\n– may make little to no difference to the risk of the procedure failing completely.\n– we do not know if it has an effect on pain during the procedure because the evidence is very uncertain.\n– we do not know if it has an effect on other unwanted effects because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are confident in the evidence showing that ultrasound reduces the number of attempts and the procedure time. Our confidence is moderate for the finding that ultrasound increases the chance of success on the first try.\n\nHowever, we have little confidence in the evidence for patient satisfaction and technical failure. We are not confident at all in the evidence for pain during the procedure and unwanted effects. Our lack of confidence is mainly because there were not enough studies or people included to be certain about these results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",
