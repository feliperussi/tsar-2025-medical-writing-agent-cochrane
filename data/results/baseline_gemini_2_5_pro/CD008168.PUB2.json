It is unclear if either method is better at preventing brain damage, and there may be little difference in other unwanted effects.\n\n– Giving light therapy with breaks may mean a baby spends less total time under the lights. This could make it easier for mothers to feed and bond with their baby.\n\n– More and better-quality research is needed to be sure that giving light therapy with breaks is as safe and effective as giving it continuously. This is especially important for babies born early (preterm babies).\n\nWhat is jaundice in newborn babies?\n\nJaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that causes their skin and the whites of their eyes to turn yellow. It happens when there is too much of a substance called bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance that the body creates when it replaces old red blood cells.\n\nFor most babies, jaundice is harmless and goes away on its own. However, if bilirubin levels get very high and are not treated, it can cause a type of brain damage called kernicterus.\n\nHow is jaundice treated?\n\nThe most common treatment for jaundice is phototherapy. This involves placing the baby under special blue lights. The light helps the baby's body break down the bilirubin so it can be removed from the body.\n\nPhototherapy can be given in two ways:\n– continuously, where the baby stays under the lights without a break; or\n– intermittently, where the baby is under the lights for a period of time and then has a break.\n\nGiving light therapy with breaks could have practical benefits, such as making it easier for mothers to hold, comfort, and feed their baby.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving light therapy with breaks was as safe and effective as giving it continuously for treating jaundice in newborn babies.\n\nWe were interested in how well each method lowered bilirubin levels and if there were any differences in unwanted or harmful effects, such as brain damage or death.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared giving light therapy with breaks to giving it without breaks for newborn babies with jaundice. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 12 studies that included a total of 1600 newborn babies with jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**How quickly bilirubin levels dropped**\nGiving light therapy with breaks may make little to no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels in the blood go down compared to giving it continuously.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\n– Brain damage: We are uncertain if either method is better at preventing brain damage caused by high bilirubin levels. This is because very few studies reported on this, and the information was not detailed enough.\n– Treatment failure (when the light therapy did not work well enough): Giving light therapy with breaks may have little to no effect on the number of babies whose treatment failed, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n– Death: Giving light therapy with breaks may make little to no difference to the number of babies who died.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies we found were small. Also, important safety issues, like the risk of brain damage, were not well-reported in the studies. This means we cannot be certain about the results and more research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",
