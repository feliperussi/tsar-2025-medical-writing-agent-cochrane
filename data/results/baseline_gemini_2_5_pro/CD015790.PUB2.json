  "text": "Can self-management programs help improve quality of life for adults with vision problems?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For adults with vision problems, self-management programs may make little to no difference to their quality of life (both general health and vision-related). They also may not affect the risk of unwanted effects. However, we have little confidence in this evidence.\n\n– Future research should include people with different stages of vision loss and people who have both vision and hearing problems. Researchers also need to find better ways to measure how these programs affect people's quality of life.\n\n**What is visual impairment and why is self-management important?**\n\nVisual impairment, or having vision problems that cannot be fully corrected with glasses, is a major health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It is most common in older adults. Losing vision can make daily activities difficult and can affect a person's mood and overall well-being.\n\nSelf-management programs are designed to help people with long-term health conditions. These programs teach people skills to manage their condition, stay active, and live as well as possible.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs improve the quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared these programs to either usual care (the standard care a person would normally receive) or no program at all.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program for adults with vision problems. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 20 studies that included 3151 people. The people in the studies were mostly older adults, with an average age between 60 and 84 years. The most common cause of vision loss was a condition called age-related macular degeneration. The studies took place in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. We did not find any studies that included adults with both vision and hearing loss.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n– **General health quality of life:** Self-management programs may make little to no difference to a person's general health-related quality of life.\n\n– **Vision-related quality of life:** Self-management programs may also make little to no difference to quality of life specifically related to vision.\n\n– **Unwanted effects:** Self-management programs may make little to no difference to the risk of unwanted effects. Most studies reported no unwanted effects related to the programs. One study noted that more people in the self-management group were referred to a doctor for symptoms of depression compared to those in the group with no program.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies were often small, and they used different types of self-management programs and included different groups of people. Because of these issues, we are not certain about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",
