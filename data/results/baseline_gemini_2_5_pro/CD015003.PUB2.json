The evidence we found is not reliable.\n\n– Colchicine may increase the risk of having diarrhoea, but we are very uncertain about other unwanted effects.\n\n– Better-quality studies are needed to understand if colchicine is a safe and useful medicine for preventing a first heart attack or stroke.\n\n**What are heart attacks and strokes?**\n\nHeart attacks and strokes are serious medical conditions often caused by blocked blood vessels. These blockages can stop blood from getting to the heart or brain. This is often caused by a condition where fatty materials build up inside the arteries, making them narrower and harder. This process is linked to inflammation, which is the body's natural response to injury or infection but can be harmful when it lasts for a long time.\n\n**What is colchicine?**\n\nColchicine is a medicine that has been used for a very long time to reduce inflammation in the body. Because it is not expensive, researchers are interested in whether it could help prevent heart and blood vessel problems.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if taking colchicine is better than a placebo (a dummy pill) or usual care for preventing a first heart attack or stroke in people who do not already have heart disease. We also wanted to know about any unwanted or harmful effects of taking colchicine.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine with a placebo, other medicines, or no treatment in adults who had not had a heart attack or stroke before. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and assessed how certain we could be about the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 15 studies that included a total of 1721 people. The studies lasted for different lengths of time, from 4 weeks to over 13 years.\n\nA major problem was that many of the studies included people with specific health conditions, like liver disease, rather than the general population we were interested in. This makes it difficult to apply the findings to most people.\n\nThe evidence from these studies was very uncertain for all the things we looked at.\n\n**Colchicine compared to a placebo (a dummy pill)**\n\n– We do not know if colchicine has an effect on the risk of death from any cause, heart attack, or stroke.\n\n– Colchicine may increase the number of people who get diarrhoea.\n\n– We do not know if colchicine has an effect on other unwanted effects.\n\n**Colchicine compared to usual care or other medicines**\n\nThere was not enough information to know if colchicine was better or worse than usual care or another anti-inflammatory medicine called methotrexate.\n\nThe studies did not provide any information on other important outcomes, such as heart failure or other blood vessel problems.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons.\n\nMost of the studies we found had flaws in their methods, which means their results may not be reliable. The studies were also very small, and there were not enough of them to be certain about the effects of colchicine.\n\nFinally, because many studies focused on people with other health problems, the results may not apply to the general population who are trying to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",
