  "text": "Does using a surgical drain after an operation for a burst appendix help prevent infections and other problems?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people having surgery for a burst appendix (complicated appendicitis), using a surgical drain probably increases the risk of death. It is unclear if using a drain has any effect on preventing infections inside the belly or in the surgical wound.\n\n– Using a drain may also mean people stay in the hospital longer, but we are very uncertain about this. We found no studies that compared different types of drains or looked at the best time to remove them.\n\n– Because of the poor quality of the existing studies, better and larger studies are needed to understand the true effects of using drains after this type of surgery, especially the risk of death.\n\n**What is complicated appendicitis?**\n\nAppendicitis is when the appendix, a small organ attached to the large intestine, becomes swollen and painful. If it is not treated quickly, the appendix can become severely damaged or burst. This is called 'complicated appendicitis' and it can cause a serious infection inside the belly.\n\nThe main treatment for appendicitis is an operation to remove the appendix, called an appendectomy. After surgery for complicated appendicitis, surgeons sometimes place a small tube, called a drain, into the belly. The drain is meant to let out any infected fluid and prevent a pocket of pus (an abscess) from forming.\n\n**Why did we do this review?**\n\nThe use of drains after surgery for complicated appendicitis is debated. Some surgeons believe they are helpful, while others think they might cause more harm than good.\n\nWe wanted to find out if using a surgical drain after an appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is better or worse than not using a drain. We also wanted to know if one type of drain is better than another, and what the best time is to remove a drain.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared using a surgical drain to not using one after surgery for complicated appendicitis in children and adults. The studies we looked for were ones where people were put into treatment groups by chance, as this type of study provides the most reliable evidence.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 8 studies that included a total of 739 people, including both children and adults. The studies took place in North America, Asia, and Africa. All of the studies compared using a drain to not using a drain.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n**Using a drain versus not using a drain**\n\n– Using a drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days of surgery. In the studies, there were 7 deaths in the group of 291 people who had a drain, compared to 1 death in the group of 290 people who did not have a drain.\n\n– It is unclear if using a drain has any effect on the risk of developing an infection inside the belly (an abscess) or in the surgical wound.\n\n– Using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this.\n\nWe found no studies that compared different types of drains or different schedules for removing drains.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in most of the evidence is very low. This is because there were problems with how the studies were designed and carried out. Also, the results varied between studies, and most studies were too small to give us a reliable answer.\n\nOur confidence in the finding about the risk of death is moderate. We are less certain about this finding because it is based on a small number of deaths.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
