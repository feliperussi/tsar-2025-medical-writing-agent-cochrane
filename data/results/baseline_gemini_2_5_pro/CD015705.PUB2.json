However, it also creates risks, such as breaking patient privacy, creating extra costs for staff, and leading to unequal care for patients.\n\n– In some workplaces, using personal phones has become so common that staff may feel pressured by managers or colleagues to use their own devices, time, and money for work.\n\n– Future efforts to improve healthcare systems should aim to keep the benefits of these informal practices while reducing the problems they cause for staff, patients, and the system itself.\n\n**What is this review about?**\n\nHealthcare workers are often expected to do a lot, but their workplaces may not provide them with the best tools for communication. To solve this problem, many workers start using their own mobile phones to help with their jobs.\n\nThis use is often informal, meaning it is not controlled or supported by their workplace. While using a personal phone can help healthcare workers get their jobs done, it can also lead to new challenges for them, their patients, and the healthcare system.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of healthcare workers who use their personal mobile phones and other devices for their jobs. We wanted to learn about the good things and the bad things that happen because of this.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that explored the views and experiences of healthcare workers who use their personal mobile phones and other devices for work. We then combined and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the findings.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from a mix of high-, middle-, and low-income countries. They included many different types of healthcare workers and settings. Most studies looked at the use of mobile phones rather than other devices like tablets.\n\nWe are moderately to highly confident in our main findings.\n\n**Why healthcare workers use their own phones**\nHealthcare workers often face a gap between what their job expects of them and the resources they are given. To fill this gap, they develop their own strategies. This includes using their own mobile phones, mobile data, and calling credit. They also use their personal time for calls outside of work hours and contact their own network of friends and family for help and advice.\n\n**The benefits of using personal phones**\nUsing personal phones can make healthcare more human. It allows workers to be more flexible, efficient, and quick to respond to patient needs. It can give patients direct access to a specific healthcare worker instead of a general system. This can also help build stronger, more trusting relationships between healthcare workers, patients, and colleagues.\n\n**The problems caused by using personal phones**\nHowever, these informal methods can also cause serious problems.\n\n– **Problems for healthcare workers:** Using a personal phone for work costs staff money for the device, data, and calls. This is a bigger problem for workers who are paid less. It can also blur the line between work and home life, as they may feel they cannot ignore calls when they are off duty. It can also create unfairness. For example, workers with poor internet access or weaker personal networks may be at a disadvantage.\n\n– **Problems for patients:** When healthcare workers store patient information on their personal phones, there is a risk that this private information could be shared by mistake. Also, care can become unequal. Workers might decide to use their personal time and money to help certain patients they feel are more in need, which may not be fair to others.\n\n– **Problems for the healthcare system:** When information is shared on personal phones, it is not recorded in the official system. This means important details about patient care can be lost. It can also be a source of distraction for workers, who might receive personal calls or use social media during work.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have moderate to high confidence in our findings. The studies we included were qualitative, which means they focused on people's views and experiences rather than numbers. This helped us understand the reasons behind why and how healthcare workers use their personal phones for work.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
