For example, programs in schools and mobile clinics were most often reported in Africa, while mobile clinics were most common in the Americas.\n\n– To help more people get the glasses they need, future research should focus on finding out which of these ways of delivering eye care are the most effective, as very few studies have checked how well they work.\n\n**Why is it important to get eye tests and glasses?**\n\nMany people around the world have blurry vision because they need glasses but do not have them. This is called 'uncorrected refractive error'. In most cases, this problem can be fixed with the right pair of glasses.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) wants to make sure more people can get the eye care they need. To do this, it is important to have good eye care services available in local communities and primary health centers, not just in large hospitals.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out what different ways are used to provide eye tests and glasses in community and primary care settings. We also wanted to see if these different ways had been studied to see how well they work.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies and reports published between January 2002 and November 2022. We looked for information that described different ways of providing eye tests and glasses in local communities and health centers. We then collected and summarized the information from these documents.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 402 documents that described different ways of delivering eye care. These approaches could be grouped into two main settings.\n\nIn community settings, the main ways to provide eye care were:\n– at schools\n– at pharmacies\n– through outreach programs, like mobile clinics that travel to different places\n\nIn primary care settings (a person's first point of contact for health care), the main ways were:\n– at vision centers\n– at general health centers\n– a combination of a center and door-to-door visits\n\nThe most common approaches were programs in schools and mobile outreach clinics. Vision centers were also used often.\n\nOur main finding was that while many different ways to deliver eye care exist, very few studies have checked to see how well they work. This means we do not know which methods are best for helping people get the eye care they need.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe main limitation is that we found very few studies that evaluated the different ways of delivering eye care. Most of the documents we found only described a program but did not measure its success. Because of this, we cannot say which approaches are better than others at helping people get the glasses they need.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",
