This includes conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (a mental health condition that can develop after a traumatic event), anxiety, or depression.\n\n- Allowing family members to be present may make little to no difference to the length of the resuscitation attempt or to the stress levels of the healthcare professionals involved. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\n- More and better-quality research is needed to understand the true effects of having family members present during resuscitation on everyone involved – the family, the patient, and the healthcare team.\n\n### What is family presence during resuscitation?\n\nResuscitation is an emergency medical procedure used to try and save someone's life when their heart or breathing has stopped. It often happens very suddenly in a hospital emergency department or before the person gets to the hospital.\n\nDuring this stressful time, some family members may want to be in the room with their loved one. This is called 'family presence during resuscitation'. It involves a complex relationship between the patient, their family, and the healthcare professionals trying to save the patient's life. The needs and well-being of all three groups must be considered.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out what effects offering family members the choice to be present during resuscitation has on:\n- the family members' mental health, especially their risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, or depression;\n- the patient's chances of survival or recovery;\n- the medical care provided during the resuscitation;\n- the stress levels of the healthcare professionals.\n\n### What did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared offering family members the choice to be present during a resuscitation attempt with the usual practice of not offering this choice. The studies we looked for were randomized controlled trials, where people are placed into different groups by chance. This helps to ensure the groups are similar and the results are reliable. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\n\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 595 family members. One large study took place in France with ambulance services, and a second, much smaller study took place in a hospital emergency department in the UK.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**Mental health of family members**\nWe do not know if offering family members the option to be present during resuscitation has an effect on their long-term mental well-being. The evidence we found was very uncertain, so we cannot be sure if it reduces or increases symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\n**Effects on medical care and healthcare staff**\nFamily presence may have little to no effect on how long the resuscitation attempt lasts or on the stress levels of the healthcare staff. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nThe studies did not provide information on the patient's chances of survival.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because the studies were not conducted in a way that prevents potential errors in their results. For example, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which group they were in, which could have affected the outcomes. Also, the evidence is based on only two studies, and there were not enough people included for us to be certain about the findings.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
