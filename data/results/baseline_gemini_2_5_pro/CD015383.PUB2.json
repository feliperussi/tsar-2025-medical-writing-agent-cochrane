  "text": "Can therapy with psychedelic medicines help people with life-threatening illnesses manage anxiety and depression?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people with life-threatening illnesses, therapy that includes psychedelic medicines like psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') or LSD may reduce anxiety and depression. We do not know if therapy with MDMA ('Ecstasy') has an effect on anxiety or depression.\n\n– The unwanted effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy were generally mild to moderate and did not last long. They included temporary increases in blood pressure, nausea (feeling sick), and anxiety. No serious unwanted effects were reported in the studies we found.\n\n– We have little confidence in these findings. The studies included only a small number of people, and it was difficult to stop people from knowing whether they had received the real medicine or a placebo (a 'dummy' medicine). More and larger studies are needed to better understand the true benefits and risks.\n\n**What is psychedelic-assisted therapy?**\n\nPeople who have a life-threatening illness, such as cancer, often experience anxiety, depression, and existential distress. Existential distress can include feelings that life has no meaning or purpose.\n\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment being explored to help with these feelings. It involves taking a psychedelic medicine under the supervision of trained therapists. The experience is combined with therapy sessions before and after taking the medicine. Some of the medicines studied include psilocybin (from 'magic mushrooms'), LSD, and MDMA ('Ecstasy'). In most countries, these medicines are illegal.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychedelic-assisted therapy is better than a placebo or other treatments for reducing anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening illnesses. We also wanted to know about any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or a very low dose of the psychedelic medicine. The studies we looked for were randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 6 studies that included 140 people with life-threatening illnesses. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland and lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies were not funded by drug companies but by organizations that support research into psychedelic therapy.\n\nThe studies looked at two types of therapy: one using psilocybin or LSD, and another using MDMA.\n\n**Therapy with psilocybin or LSD**\n\n– **Anxiety and depression:** Therapy with psilocybin or LSD may reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression when compared to a placebo.\n\n– **Existential distress:** We are very uncertain about the effect of this therapy on feelings of existential distress.\n\n**Therapy with MDMA**\n\n– **Anxiety and depression:** We do not know if therapy with MDMA has an effect on anxiety or depression. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\n\nNo serious unwanted effects were reported in any of the studies.\n\nFor therapy with psilocybin or LSD, common unwanted effects were temporary and included increased blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, and emotional distress.\n\nFor therapy with MDMA, common unwanted effects were also temporary and included anxiety, dry mouth, and headaches.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Our confidence is low for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, it was likely that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. The effects of psychedelic medicines are very noticeable, so it was hard to hide who received the real medicine and who received the placebo. This could have influenced the results.\n\nSecond, the studies were very small and did not include many people. This makes the results less certain.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",
