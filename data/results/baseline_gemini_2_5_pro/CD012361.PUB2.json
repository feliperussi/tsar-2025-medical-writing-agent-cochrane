Four studies are currently in progress.\n\nWhat is the issue?\n\nNewborn babies who are very ill may need a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation) to help them breathe. This can be uncomfortable and painful for them. To help them rest and feel less pain, doctors give them medicines for sedation (to make them sleepy) and analgesia (for pain relief).\n\nMedicines like morphine are often used, but they can have serious side effects. Dexmedetomidine is another medicine that provides both sedation and pain relief. Some doctors believe it might be safer for newborn babies because it has fewer effects on breathing and blood pressure. Even though it is not officially approved for use in babies, its use is increasing.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is better or worse than other medicines, or a placebo (a dummy treatment), for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on breathing machines. We also wanted to know about its safety and any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines or a placebo for newborn babies (less than four weeks old) who needed a breathing machine.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe did not find any completed studies that we could include in our review. This means we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of using dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies.\n\nWe did find four studies that are still in progress. When they are finished, they may provide some answers.\n– Two studies are comparing dexmedetomidine with another pain medicine called fentanyl in newborn babies who need surgery.\n– One study is comparing dexmedetomidine with morphine in babies who did not get enough oxygen at birth.\n– One study is looking at dexmedetomidine in young children having a heart scan.\n\nBecause we found no studies, we do not know what the effects of dexmedetomidine are on:\n– how sleepy or comfortable a baby is;\n– how much pain a baby feels;\n– how long a baby needs to be on a breathing machine;\n– whether a baby needs extra medicine for pain or sedation;\n– a baby's brain development in the long term.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because we found no completed studies that met our criteria. Without any studies, we cannot say whether dexmedetomidine is helpful or harmful for newborn babies on breathing machines.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
