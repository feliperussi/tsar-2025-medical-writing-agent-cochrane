The studies did not report on any unwanted effects.\n\n– This is because we found only two very small studies on this topic.\n\n– More and better-quality research is needed to understand if personalized nutrition is a helpful approach for young people with obesity.\n\n**What is obesity?**\n\nObesity is a health condition where a person has an amount of body fat that may harm their health. It is a common problem for children and teenagers around the world.\n\nHealth professionals often give general diet advice to help young people manage their weight. This is sometimes called a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach because the same advice is given to everyone.\n\n**What is personalized nutrition?**\n\nPersonalized nutrition is a different approach. Instead of general advice, it creates a diet plan tailored to a specific person. This plan considers many individual factors, such as:\n\n– genetics\n– current eating habits\n– health status\n– physical activity levels\n\nThe goal is to create a more effective diet plan by understanding what works best for each individual.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if personalized nutrition plans are better than standard \"one-size-fits-all\" diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity manage their weight.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared personalized nutrition plans with standard diet advice for children and teenagers with obesity. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also assessed how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 105 children and teenagers with obesity. The studies took place in Ukraine and Greece. One study was funded by a nonprofit organization, and the other did not report its funding source.\n\nThe personalized nutrition plans in these studies used a computer tool. This tool used information about each person to create tailored diet recommendations.\n\nBased on these two studies:\n\n– For children aged 0 to 9 years, we do not know if personalized nutrition has an effect on their weight or body mass index (BMI) compared to standard diet advice.\n\n– For children and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years, we also do not know if personalized nutrition has an effect on their weight or BMI compared to standard diet advice.\n\nThe studies did not provide information about other important outcomes, such as well-being or any unwanted effects of the diets.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Our confidence is very low because the findings are based on only two very small studies. Also, the studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
