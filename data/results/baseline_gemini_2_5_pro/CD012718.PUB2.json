  "text": "Can a liquid called silver diamine fluoride (SDF) help prevent or stop tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Compared to no treatment, a liquid called silver diamine fluoride (SDF) that is painted onto teeth probably helps prevent new tooth decay on the roots of teeth in older adults. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth. For most other uses, such as preventing decay on the main surfaces of teeth, we are very unsure if SDF helps.\n\n– When compared with other common dental treatments like fluoride varnish, we are very unsure if SDF is better, worse, or the same for preventing or stopping tooth decay.\n\n– Because most of the available evidence is not strong, more and better studies are needed. Future research should carefully measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth, which can be a concern for patients.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\n\nTooth decay, also known as dental caries, is the most common disease in the world. It happens when the hard outer surface of a tooth (enamel) is damaged. If not treated, decay can lead to holes in the teeth (cavities), pain, and infection. It can affect people's ability to eat and their overall well-being.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride?\n\nSilver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that can be painted onto teeth by a dental professional. It is used to help prevent tooth decay from starting or to stop decay that has already begun from getting worse. It is a simple and cost-effective treatment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if SDF is effective and safe for preventing and stopping tooth decay in the baby teeth of children and the permanent teeth of children and adults. We also wanted to see how it compared to other treatments, a fake treatment (placebo), or no treatment at all.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared SDF with no treatment, a placebo, or other dental treatments for tooth decay. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 29 studies that included a total of 13,036 people. Most of the people in the studies were children (12,020), and there were also 1016 older adults.\n\nWe found that the studies had some problems with how they were carried out, which affects our confidence in their results.\n\nSDF compared with no treatment or a fake treatment (placebo)\n– SDF probably prevents new decay on the roots of teeth in older adults.\n– SDF may help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\n– We are very unsure if SDF helps prevent new decay on the main surfaces of baby teeth or permanent teeth.\n\nSDF compared with fluoride varnish\n– SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth compared to fluoride varnish.\n– For other uses, such as stopping decay, we are very unsure if SDF is better or worse than fluoride varnish.\n\nSDF compared with other treatments (like sealants or special fillings)\n– We are very unsure if SDF is better, worse, or the same as other treatments like dental sealants or special fillings for stopping tooth decay.\n\nDifferent ways of applying SDF\n– We are also unsure if applying SDF more or less often, or using different strengths of the liquid, makes any difference.\n\nUnwanted effects\n– A known unwanted effect of SDF is that it can cause black stains on the parts of the tooth where it is applied. However, this and other unwanted effects were not reported well in the studies, so we are very uncertain about them.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in most of the evidence. This is because of concerns about how the studies were carried out. For example, in some studies, it is possible that people knew which treatment they were getting. Also, many of the studies were small, which makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
