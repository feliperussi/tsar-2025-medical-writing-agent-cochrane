It also seems reasonably good at correctly ruling out a serious cause.\n\n– Adding a hearing test to the exam (called HINTS Plus) may also be good at identifying a serious cause, but it may be less accurate at ruling one out.\n\n– We have little confidence in these findings because of weaknesses in the available studies. More high-quality research is needed to know how accurate the HINTS test is when used by different types of healthcare workers and in different medical settings.\n\n**What is severe, sudden dizziness?**\n\nDizziness is a common reason people seek medical help. One specific type is called acute vestibular syndrome. This is a condition that develops suddenly and causes severe dizziness or a spinning feeling (vertigo), nausea and vomiting, unsteadiness, and uncontrolled eye movements.\n\n**Why is it important to find the cause of severe dizziness?**\n\nSudden, severe dizziness can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (a 'peripheral' cause) or a problem in the brain, like a stroke (a 'central' cause).\n\nProblems in the inner ear are usually less serious. However, problems in the brain can be life-threatening and require urgent treatment. Because the treatments are very different, it is important for doctors to quickly and accurately find out what is causing the dizziness.\n\n**What is the HINTS test?**\n\nThe HINTS test is a three-part physical exam that a healthcare worker can perform to help tell the difference between a central and a peripheral cause of dizziness. The three parts check for:\n\n– how the eyes move when the head is turned quickly;\n– any involuntary, jerky eye movements;\n– whether the eyes are properly aligned with each other.\n\nSometimes, a hearing test is added to this exam. This is called the HINTS Plus test.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests are for identifying a central cause (a problem in the brain) for sudden, severe dizziness.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at the accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests. The studies compared the results of the HINTS test to a final diagnosis made using brain scans (like an MRI) or by a brain specialist (a neurologist). We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 16 studies that included 2024 people with sudden, severe dizziness. The average age of people in the studies was 60 years. Most studies took place in a hospital emergency department, and the tests were usually performed by doctors, often neurologists.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n– The HINTS exam, when performed by a trained healthcare worker just by looking at the person's eyes, may be good at correctly identifying people whose dizziness is caused by a serious problem in the brain. It may also be reasonably good at correctly identifying people whose dizziness is caused by a less serious inner ear problem.\n\n– Adding a hearing test (the HINTS Plus exam) may also be good at identifying a serious cause, but it may be less accurate at correctly ruling one out.\n\n– Some studies looked at using video goggles to record eye movements during the test. There was not enough information to be certain about the accuracy of these video-assisted tests.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because of weaknesses in how some of the studies were designed. For example, the way people were chosen to be included in some studies could have made the test seem more accurate than it really is. Also, the way the HINTS test was performed in some studies might not be how it is used in everyday medical practice.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
