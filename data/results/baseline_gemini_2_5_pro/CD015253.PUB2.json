However, it is very unclear if it helps hearing return to normal, and it may cause some ear pain.\n\n– We have little confidence in these findings. The available evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the true benefits and risks of autoinflation.\n\n– More and better-quality research is needed to understand if autoinflation is a helpful treatment for children with glue ear.\n\n**What is glue ear?**\n\nGlue ear is a common childhood condition where the middle ear fills with a sticky, glue-like fluid. This fluid can make it harder for children to hear properly. If the hearing loss lasts a long time, it can sometimes affect a child's speech and behaviour. The medical name for glue ear is 'otitis media with effusion' (OME).\n\n**What is autoinflation?**\n\nAutoinflation is a simple technique that children can do themselves to help clear the fluid from their middle ear. It involves using a special medical balloon or another device. The child blows up the balloon using their nose, one nostril at a time. This action increases the pressure in the nose and helps to open a tube that connects the throat to the middle ear (the Eustachian tube). Opening this tube can help the fluid to drain away.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if autoinflation helps children with glue ear. We were interested in its effects on:\n\n– hearing;\n– quality of life related to glue ear;\n– any unwanted effects, like pain.\n\nWe compared autoinflation with no treatment (also known as 'watchful waiting').\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment in children with glue ear up to 12 years old. In these studies, children were placed into treatment groups at random. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 11 studies that included 1036 children with glue ear. Most children in the studies were between 3 and 11 years old. The studies took place in Europe and North America, in both hospitals and local communities. In most studies, children used the autoinflation device two or three times a day for between 2 and 12 weeks.\n\n**Main results**\n\nCompared with no treatment:\n\n– **Quality of life:** Autoinflation may moderately improve a child's quality of life related to their glue ear after three months.\n\n– **Fluid in the ear:** Autoinflation may slightly increase the chance that the fluid in the ear clears up after three months.\n\n– **Hearing:** We are very uncertain if autoinflation helps hearing return to normal.\n\n– **Pain:** Autoinflation may increase the risk of ear pain, but we are very uncertain about this. Very few children in the studies reported having ear pain.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because most of the studies were small, and there were some concerns about the way they were carried out. This means that we cannot be certain about the results, and future research could lead to different conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
