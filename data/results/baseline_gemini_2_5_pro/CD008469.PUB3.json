  "text": "What are the benefits and risks of home-based education for children with asthma?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if providing asthma education at home for children and their families has an effect on the number of emergency visits or the need for steroid tablets for asthma flare-ups. This is because the evidence we found is very uncertain.\n\n– A more intensive home-based education program (for example, one with more or longer sessions) may reduce the number of children who need to stay in the hospital for their asthma compared to a less intensive program.\n\n– The studies we found were very different from each other, which makes it hard to be sure about the results. Future research should try to find out which parts of an education program are most important for helping children manage their asthma.\n\n**What is asthma and how is it managed?**\n\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is very common in children around the world.\n\nA key part of managing asthma is education. This involves teaching children and their families about the condition, what can trigger an asthma attack (like dust or pollen), and how to use medicines correctly, such as inhalers. This education helps people manage their symptoms and live healthier lives.\n\n**Why did we do this review?**\n\nAsthma education can be provided in different places, like a doctor's office, a clinic, or at home. Giving education at home can make it easier for families who might have trouble getting to appointments.\n\nWe wanted to find out if providing asthma education in the home is better for children than the usual care they receive, or education given in another setting. This is an update of a review we did before.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children with either usual care or a less intensive education program. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 26 studies that included a total of 5122 children with asthma. The children in the studies were between 1 and 18 years old, and their asthma ranged from mild to severe.\n\nThe studies were very different from each other. The type of education, how often it was given, and what it aimed to achieve varied a lot between studies.\n\n**Home-based education compared with usual care**\n\nWe are not sure if home-based education affects the number of times children visit the emergency department for their asthma. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHome-based education may make little to no difference to the number of times children need steroid tablets for an asthma flare-up.\n\nWe are also very uncertain about whether home-based education improves quality of life, reduces the number of school days missed, or leads to fewer symptom-free days.\n\n**More intensive compared with less intensive home-based education**\n\nA more intensive home-based education program may reduce the number of children who need to be admitted to the hospital for their asthma.\n\nHowever, a more intensive program may make little to no difference to the number of emergency visits, the need for steroid tablets, or the number of school days missed.\n\nThe studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the education programs.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is mainly because the studies we found were very different from each other. They included children of different ages with different levels of asthma severity, and the education programs they used also varied a lot. This makes it difficult to combine their results and draw clear conclusions.\n\nAlso, in many studies, it is possible that the families knew which type of education they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
