This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n\n– None of the studies we found reported on how entecavir affected people's quality of life.\n\n– More and better studies are needed to understand the true benefits and harms of entecavir for people with chronic hepatitis B, especially for important outcomes like quality of life and serious unwanted effects.\n\n**What is chronic hepatitis B?**\n\nHepatitis B is a liver infection caused by a virus. When the infection lasts for a long time (more than six months), it is called chronic hepatitis B. Over time, it can cause serious liver damage. Chronic hepatitis B is a major health problem around the world.\n\nMedicines called antivirals are used to treat chronic hepatitis B. They work by stopping the virus from multiplying in the body. Entecavir is an antiviral medicine that is often recommended as a first-choice treatment for people with this condition.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of entecavir for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. We compared entecavir with either no treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment that contains no medicine).\n\nWe were most interested in finding out if entecavir:\n– helps people live longer;\n– improves their quality of life;\n– causes any serious unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared entecavir against no treatment or a placebo in people with chronic hepatitis B. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 22 studies that included 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. One study included only children, 19 included only adults, and the others included a mix of ages or did not state the age. The studies lasted from 5 weeks to over 4 years.\n\n**Main results**\n\n**Deaths from any cause**\nThe studies that looked at whether people died did not report any deaths in either the entecavir group or the no treatment/placebo group. This means we cannot tell if entecavir affects the risk of dying.\n\n**Quality of life**\nNone of the studies we found provided any information about people's health-related quality of life.\n\n**Serious unwanted effects**\nWe do not know if entecavir has an effect on the risk of serious unwanted effects when compared to no treatment or a placebo. The evidence was very uncertain.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons. There were concerns about how some of the studies were conducted, which could have affected their results. Also, very few serious unwanted effects were reported, and no deaths occurred in the studies. This makes it difficult to be certain about the true effects of entecavir.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
