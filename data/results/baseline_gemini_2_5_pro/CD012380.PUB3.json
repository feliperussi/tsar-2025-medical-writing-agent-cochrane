Information on unwanted or harmful effects was limited.\n– More and better research is urgently needed. Future studies should include older children and adults, last for a longer time, and look at how treatments affect people's long-term kidney health.\n\n### What is sickle cell disease and how does it affect the kidneys?\n\nSickle cell disease is an inherited health condition that affects red blood cells. These cells can become hard, sticky, and shaped like a crescent or \"sickle\". This can block blood flow, causing severe pain and damage to organs throughout the body, including the kidneys.\n\nOver time, this damage can lead to chronic kidney disease. This is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. Kidney disease is a common and serious problem for people with sickle cell disease.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if any treatments can help prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We were interested in several treatments, including:\n– a medicine called hydroxyurea\n– a type of medicine called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is often used to treat high blood pressure\n– red blood cell transfusions\n\n### What did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments to a fake treatment (a placebo) or another treatment. The studies we looked for assigned people to treatment groups at random (these are called randomized controlled trials). We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\n\nWe found 3 studies that included a total of 385 people with sickle cell disease. One study looked at hydroxyurea in very young children. Two studies looked at ACE inhibitors in children and adults. We did not find any studies that looked at red blood cell transfusions for preventing kidney problems.\n\n**Hydroxyurea compared to a fake medicine (placebo)**\nOne study in 193 young children (aged 9 to 18 months) compared taking hydroxyurea to taking a placebo.\n– We do not know if hydroxyurea has an effect on overall kidney function.\n– Hydroxyurea may improve the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine.\n– Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to the number of serious problems related to sickle cell disease, such as severe pain, chest problems, or stays in the hospital.\n\n**ACE inhibitors compared to a fake medicine (placebo) or vitamin C**\n– One very small study in 22 adults compared an ACE inhibitor to a placebo. We do not know if the ACE inhibitor has an effect on kidney function or on the amount of protein in the urine (a sign of kidney damage).\n– Another study in 170 children compared an ACE inhibitor to vitamin C. We could not use the information from this study, so we do not know if the ACE inhibitor has an effect on protein in the urine in children.\n\nNone of the studies reported on how the treatments affected people's quality of life.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies we found were very small, which makes the results uncertain. There were also some concerns with how the studies were carried out. Because the studies only included very specific groups (like very young children or adults with early signs of kidney problems), the findings may not apply to all people with sickle cell disease.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
