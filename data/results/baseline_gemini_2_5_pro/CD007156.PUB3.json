They may also slightly improve how wide people can open their mouths for a few months. Unwanted effects were generally mild stomach problems.\n\n– For most other treatments, including different medicines, injections, and physiotherapy, we do not know if they work because there was not enough good-quality evidence. There was also not enough information to be sure about the unwanted effects of most treatments.\n\n– Better studies are needed to find out which treatments work best. Future studies should measure things that are important to people with the condition, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\n**What is oral submucous fibrosis?**\n\nOral submucous fibrosis is a long-term condition that makes the inside of the mouth and cheeks stiff. Over time, this can cause severe pain and make it very difficult to open the mouth. This affects a person's ability to eat, swallow, and speak, which can lower their quality of life.\n\nThe main cause of this condition is chewing areca nut (sometimes called betel nut). People with oral submucous fibrosis also have a higher risk of developing mouth cancer. The most important part of treatment is help to stop chewing areca nut.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis. This review is an update of a previous version.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 30 studies that included 2176 people with oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nThe main results are for treatments compared with a placebo or no treatment.\n\n**Antioxidant medicines**\nAntioxidants are substances that may protect your cells against damage.\n\n– **Mouth opening:** Antioxidants probably increase mouth opening slightly when measured between 3 and 6 months after starting treatment. However, this improvement was small and may not be large enough to make a difference to people's daily lives. We are less certain if they improve mouth opening in the first 3 months or after 6 months.\n\n– **Burning feeling:** Antioxidants probably reduce the burning feeling in the mouth. This benefit was seen for up to 6 months and beyond.\n\n– **Unwanted effects:** Some people taking antioxidants had mild and temporary stomach problems, like bloating or feeling sick.\n\n**Other treatments**\nThe studies also looked at other treatments, including:\n– steroid injections into the cheek;\n– other types of medicines;\n– physiotherapy (special exercises for the mouth and jaw).\n\nFor these other treatments, we do not know if they have an effect on mouth opening or the burning feeling. This is because we are very uncertain about the results from the studies.\n\n**Unwanted effects of treatments**\nFor most treatments, there was not enough information to be sure about their unwanted effects. One study of a type of surgery found serious unwanted effects that led to a longer hospital stay for some people.\n\n**Outcomes important to patients**\nNone of the studies reported on whether treatments helped people get back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in most of the evidence. This is because many of the studies were not well designed. For example, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, many of the studies were very small.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
