  "text": "Which types of pelvic floor muscle training work best for urinary incontinence in women?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Training that focuses on squeezing just the pelvic floor muscles may improve quality of life more than general exercises that are not focused on these muscles. For women who get supervision for their exercises, it probably makes little to no difference whether this is done one-on-one or in a group.\n– Doing pelvic floor muscle exercises more days per week may greatly improve quality of life compared to doing them fewer days per week. Unwanted effects from the training were rare and mild, such as vaginal discomfort, and were mostly linked to using training devices.\n– We need more and better studies to be certain about the best ways to do these exercises. In particular, we need more research on how often and how intensely people should do the exercises.\n\n**What is urinary incontinence and how is it treated?**\n\nUrinary incontinence is when you leak urine by accident. It is a common problem for women. There are different types, including stress incontinence (leaking when you cough, sneeze, or exercise) and urge incontinence (a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by leaking).\n\nA common first treatment is pelvic floor muscle training. These exercises are designed to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and help control urination. This training can be done in many different ways.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out which approaches to pelvic floor muscle training work best for women with urinary incontinence. We looked at comparisons of:\n\n– different types of exercises;\n– different amounts (doses) of exercise;\n– different ways of delivering the training (for example, with a therapist or at home).\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training in women with urinary incontinence. The studies had to randomly assign women to different training groups, which is the best way to compare treatments. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 63 studies that included 4920 women. Most women in the studies were middle-aged, had given birth before, and had stress incontinence. The studies took place in countries around the world.\n\nWe looked at how the different training approaches affected women's quality of life.\n\n**Type of exercise**\n– Squeezing just the pelvic floor muscles (called direct training) may moderately improve quality of life compared to exercises that are not focused on these muscles (indirect training).\n– Training that combines body movements with pelvic floor muscle squeezing may slightly improve quality of life compared to only squeezing the pelvic floor muscles.\n– Adding other exercises to direct pelvic floor muscle training may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\n**Amount of exercise**\n– Doing the exercises more days per week may greatly improve quality of life compared to doing them fewer days per week.\n– Doing the exercises without a resistance device may slightly improve quality of life, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\n**How the exercises were taught**\n– Having individual supervision probably makes little to no difference to quality of life compared to group supervision.\n– Getting instructions through technology like a mobile app may slightly improve quality of life compared to just getting written instructions.\n– We are very uncertain about other comparisons, such as supervision in a clinic versus at home, or clinic supervision versus using an app.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\nVery few women reported unwanted effects. When they did, the effects were mild and usually happened when using a training device that is placed in the vagina. These included vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. In many studies, it was not clear how women were placed into the different training groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between the people rather than the treatments. Also, many of the studies were small, and their results were sometimes different from each other. For some of the questions we had, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
