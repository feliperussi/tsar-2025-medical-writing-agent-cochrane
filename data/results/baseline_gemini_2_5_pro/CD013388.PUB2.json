We are very confident in this finding.\n\n– For care partners, cognitive rehabilitation may slightly improve their quality of life in social and psychological areas. However, the effects on other aspects of life for both the person with dementia and their care partner are less clear, and some unwanted effects were reported.\n\n– While the main findings are strong, they are based on a small number of studies, with one large study having the most impact. More high-quality research is needed to be more certain about the wider benefits of cognitive rehabilitation and to understand how to make it as effective as possible.\n\n**What is dementia and how does it affect daily life?**\n\nDementia is a long-term condition that affects the brain, causing problems with memory, thinking, and other mental abilities. These problems can make it difficult for people to carry out everyday tasks like cooking, shopping, or managing their finances. This can lead to a loss of independence and affect a person's quality of life.\n\n**What is cognitive rehabilitation?**\n\nCognitive rehabilitation is a type of therapy that helps people with dementia find new ways to handle the daily problems they face. It is a personalized approach where a therapist works with the person with dementia, and often their family, to set specific, practical goals. For example, a goal might be to learn how to use a new mobile phone or to remember appointments. The therapist then helps the person find strategies to achieve these goals.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage their chosen everyday activities. We also wanted to know what effects it had on other areas like memory, quality of life, and mood for both the person with dementia and their care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care or no specific therapy. We then collected and combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. Most people in the studies had Alzheimer's disease. The average age of the people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years old. The studies lasted for different lengths of time, and the results were mainly driven by one large, well-conducted study.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**Ability to manage everyday goals**\nCognitive rehabilitation causes a large improvement in people's ability to achieve the personal goals they set during therapy. This was true when people rated their own performance, when their care partners rated their performance, and when people rated their satisfaction with their performance. These benefits were seen at the end of the treatment and were still present 3 to 12 months later.\n\n**Other effects for the person with dementia**\n– Cognitive rehabilitation slightly increases people's self-confidence and their ability to remember things immediately after hearing them.\n– The evidence was less clear for other areas. For example, cognitive rehabilitation may make little to no difference to quality of life or mood. Some evidence suggested it may cause a small reduction in general daily functioning (tasks not specifically targeted in therapy), memory, and anxiety in the medium term, but we are not confident about these results.\n\n**Effects for care partners**\n– For care partners, cognitive rehabilitation slightly increases their quality of life related to social activities and psychological well-being in the medium term.\n– However, some evidence suggested it may cause a small reduction in care partners' mood and psychological well-being at the end of treatment, but we have little confidence in these findings.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are confident that cognitive rehabilitation helps people achieve their specific goals. Our confidence in the other findings is lower.\n\nThis is mainly because many of the results came from one large study, and more research is needed to confirm them. Also, in studies of this type of therapy, it is not possible for people to be unaware of which treatment they are getting, which can sometimes affect the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
