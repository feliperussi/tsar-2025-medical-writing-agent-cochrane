It also probably makes little to no difference to their risk of serious infections. The studies that looked for unwanted effects did not report any.\n\n– Our confidence in these findings is low because most of the studies were small and had weaknesses in how they were designed.\n\n– More and better research is needed to be sure about the effects of this practice on premature babies.\n\nWhat is a premature baby?\n\nBabies born too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, are called premature or preterm. Because they are not fully developed, they often have trouble coordinating the complex actions of sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at the same time.\n\nHow are premature babies fed?\n\nUntil they are strong enough to feed from the breast or a bottle, premature babies are often fed through a thin, soft tube. The tube goes through their nose or mouth directly into their stomach. This is called tube feeding.\n\nWhile tube feeding provides essential nutrition, it bypasses the mouth and nose. This means the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. Smelling and tasting food are important first steps that help the body get ready to digest it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if letting premature babies smell or taste milk during their tube feeds could help them learn to feed by mouth sooner. We also wanted to know if this practice was safe and if it had any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared letting premature babies smell and taste milk with not doing this during tube feeds. We compared and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies that included a total of 1277 premature babies.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**Time to feed by mouth:** Letting babies smell and taste milk may have little to no effect on how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\n**Safety:**\n– The practice probably makes little to no difference to the risk of babies developing a serious infection.\n– It may make little to no difference to the risk of a serious gut problem called necrotising enterocolitis (where the bowel tissue gets damaged).\n– The studies that looked for unwanted effects did not report any.\n\n**Other feeding outcomes:**\n– The practice may make little to no difference to how long babies need nutrition given through a vein (a drip).\n– It may have little to no effect on the time it takes for babies to get all their nutrition through the feeding tube, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWe did not find any information on whether this practice affected feeding intolerance (problems digesting milk).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in much of the evidence. This is because most of the studies were small. There were also weaknesses in how some studies were carried out. For example, in some studies, babies were not assigned to treatment groups by chance. In many studies, the hospital staff and parents knew which treatment the babies were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
