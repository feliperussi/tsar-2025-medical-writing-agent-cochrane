Standard care involves choosing antibiotics based on throat swabs and symptoms.\n\n– Using this lung camera procedure may lead to more hospital stays. The procedure itself can cause temporary side effects, like a cough that gets worse for a short time.\n\n– The current evidence comes from two studies in infants and children with CF. We do not have any evidence about whether this approach is helpful for adults with CF.\n\n**What is cystic fibrosis and why are lung infections a problem?**\n\nCystic fibrosis, or CF, is a long-term condition that mainly affects the lungs. People with CF produce thick, sticky mucus that can clog the airways. This makes it easier for harmful germs (bacteria) to grow, leading to frequent lung infections.\n\nTreating these infections early and with the right medicines (antibiotics) is very important. It helps to prevent long-term lung damage and keep people with CF as healthy as possible.\n\n**How are lung infections diagnosed?**\n\nTo choose the best antibiotic, doctors need to know which germs are causing the infection. They usually test a sample of mucus that a person coughs up from their lungs (this is called sputum).\n\nHowever, very young children and some other people with CF cannot cough up sputum. In these cases, doctors often use a simple swab to take a sample from the back of the throat. But there are concerns that a throat swab might not always find the germs that are growing deep inside the lungs.\n\nAn alternative is a procedure called a bronchoscopy. A doctor passes a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end through the nose or mouth and down into the lungs. This allows them to see the airways and collect a fluid sample directly from the lungs for testing. This procedure is more involved than a throat swab.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using samples from a bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment is better for people with CF than using standard methods, like throat swabs and clinical symptoms.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotic treatment guided by bronchoscopy with treatment guided by standard care. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found two studies that included a total of 200 children with CF. One study followed 170 infants from birth until they were five years old. The other study included 30 children aged between five and 18. Both studies compared guiding antibiotic treatment with bronchoscopy samples against standard care.\n\nWe found that guiding treatment with bronchoscopy:\n\n– **probably makes little to no difference** to lung damage seen on chest scans (CT scans).\n– **may make little to no difference** to how well the lungs work.\n– **may lead to more hospital stays** each year.\n– **probably makes no difference** to the overall cost of medical care.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\nThe bronchoscopy procedure caused some mild, temporary side effects. The most common was a cough that got worse for a short time after the procedure. In a small number of cases, children’s breathing got worse for a short period during or after the procedure.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate to low. This is because the evidence comes from only two studies, which focused only on infants and children. The studies also measured health outcomes in slightly different ways, which made it difficult to combine their results. This means we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nNo studies have looked at this approach in adults with CF.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023.",
