This is because the available evidence is very limited. One unwanted effect of bleeding during surgery was reported, but it was corrected without further issues.\n\n– More and better research is needed to understand the true effects of sinus surgery. Future studies should include more people of all ages and follow them for at least a year.\n\n**What is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose and sinuses?**\n\nCystic fibrosis is a health condition that people are born with. It causes the body to make very thick, sticky mucus. This mucus can build up in different parts of thebody, including the lungs and sinuses.\n\nWhen mucus gets trapped in the sinuses (the air-filled spaces in the bones of the face and head), it can cause long-term swelling and infection. This is called chronic rhinosinusitis. This can also lead to soft, painless growths inside the nose called nasal polyps. These problems can make it hard to breathe through the nose and may lead to more infections.\n\n**How are these nose and sinus problems treated?**\n\nDoctors often treat these problems with medicines, such as nasal rinses, to help clear the mucus. When medical treatments are not enough, another option is surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a procedure where a surgeon uses a thin tube with a camera to open up the sinuses. This can help the sinuses drain better and allow medicines to work more effectively.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if adding sinus surgery to medical treatment is better than using medical treatment alone for people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. We were interested in the effects on:\n\n– nose and sinus symptoms;\n– lung function;\n– the need for antibiotics and the number of lung flare-ups;\n– any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies where people were randomly put into groups to receive either surgery plus medical treatment or just medical treatment. This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence. We compared and summarized the results of the studies we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found only one study that matched what we were looking for. The study included 28 young adults with cystic fibrosis, aged 19 to 28. It compared people who had sinus surgery plus nasal rinses with people who only had nasal rinses.\n\nBecause we found only one small study, we are very uncertain about the effects of sinus surgery.\n\n– We do not know if adding surgery to medical treatment has an effect on nasal symptoms.\n– It is unclear if surgery reduces the amount of bacteria in the sinuses, the need for antibiotics, or the number of lung flare-ups.\n– We do not know if surgery changes lung function.\n– The study reported one case of bleeding during surgery, which was stopped during the operation without further problems.\n– The study did not report on how long people lived.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because our findings are based on only one very small study. This means we cannot be sure about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
