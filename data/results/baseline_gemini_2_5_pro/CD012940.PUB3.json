This includes their weight gain, risk of death, or risk of developing a serious gut problem.\n\n– We are not confident in these findings because they are based on only one small study.\n\n– More and larger studies are needed to understand for certain what the benefits and risks are of putting leftover milk back into a preterm baby's stomach.\n\nWhat is the issue with feeding preterm babies?\n\nBabies who are born very early are often too small or weak to feed from the breast or a bottle. Instead, they get milk through a thin tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. This is called tube feeding.\n\nBefore each tube feed, nurses often use a syringe to check if there is any milk left in the baby's stomach from the last feed. This leftover milk is called a 'gastric residual'. There is disagreement among doctors and nurses about what to do with this leftover milk. Some believe it should be put back into the stomach because it contains important substances that can help with digestion. Others believe it should be thrown away, as putting it back could cause problems like vomiting or serious infections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if it was better and safer for preterm babies to have their leftover milk put back into their stomach (re-feeding) or thrown away (discarding).\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding leftover milk with discarding it in preterm babies. We compared and summarized the results of the studies we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found one study that included 72 preterm babies. In this study, the hospital staff knew which treatment each baby was getting.\n\nThe study suggests that re-feeding leftover milk may make little to no difference to:\n– how long it takes for a baby to get back to their birth weight;\n– the risk of developing a serious gut problem called necrotising enterocolitis;\n– the risk of a baby dying before leaving the hospital;\n– how long it takes for a baby to get all their milk through the feeding tube;\n– the number of days a baby needs feeding through a vein (intravenous feeding);\n– the risk of poor growth by the time the baby leaves the hospital.\n\nWe are uncertain if re-feeding leftover milk has an effect on how often a baby's feeds have to be stopped for 12 hours or more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Our confidence is low because the findings come from only one small study. Also, in this study, the hospital staff knew which treatment each baby was getting, which could have affected the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
