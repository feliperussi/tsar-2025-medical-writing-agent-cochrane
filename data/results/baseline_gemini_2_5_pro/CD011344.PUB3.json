  "text": "For epidural pain relief in labour, is it better to get medicine in set doses or as a continuous flow?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Giving epidural pain medicine in set, timed doses (automated mandatory bolus) probably reduces the need for a specialist to give extra pain relief compared to giving it as a continuous flow (basal infusion). It also probably reduces the total amount of pain medicine used.\n\n– There is probably little to no difference between the two methods in the chances of needing a caesarean birth or a birth assisted by forceps or a vacuum device. Mothers may be more satisfied with their pain relief when it is given in set doses.\n\n– We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the chances of needing a caesarean or assisted birth.\n\n**What is an epidural for pain relief in labour?**\n\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves an injection of pain-blocking medicine into a space in the lower back called the epidural space. This numbs the nerves that send pain signals from the womb and birth canal to the brain.\n\nThe pain medicine can be given in two main ways:\n– as a continuous, steady flow, like a tap that is always on (this is called a basal infusion).\n– in set doses at set times, like a pump that gives a small amount of medicine every hour (this is called an automated mandatory bolus).\n\nOften, women can also press a button to give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it.\n\n**Why did we do this review?**\n\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving epidural medicine works best. The better method would control pain well, meaning women would be less likely to need extra help from a pain specialist (an anaesthesiologist). It should also have fewer unwanted effects, such as increasing the chance of needing a caesarean birth or a birth assisted by instruments like forceps.\n\nOur previous review suggested that giving medicine in set doses was better for pain control, but new studies have been done since then. We updated the review to include this new information.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of giving epidural medicine in set doses compared with giving it as a continuous flow for women in labour.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared giving epidural pain medicine in set doses with giving it as a continuous flow. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 18 studies that included 4590 women. Most studies included healthy women who were having their first baby. The studies used different types and doses of pain medicines.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**Pain control**\nWomen who received their epidural medicine in set doses were probably less likely to experience 'breakthrough pain' (pain severe enough to need extra treatment from a specialist) compared to women who received a continuous flow.\n\n**Amount of medicine used**\nWomen who received their medicine in set doses probably used a lower amount of pain medicine per hour.\n\n**Type of birth**\nGiving medicine in set doses probably makes little to no difference to the chance of needing a caesarean birth or a birth assisted by forceps or a vacuum device.\n\n**Other outcomes**\nThere was probably little to no difference between the two methods in how long labour lasted. Women who received their medicine in set doses may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. Both methods appeared to be equally safe for the baby, based on a health score checked right after birth (the Apgar score).\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is mainly because in some of the studies, there were concerns about how women were assigned to the different treatment groups, which could have affected the results. However, we believe the findings are unlikely to change much with more research.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
