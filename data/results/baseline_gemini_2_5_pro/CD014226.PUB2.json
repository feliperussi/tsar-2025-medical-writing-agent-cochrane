This is because we did not find any suitable studies to answer this question.\n\n– It is difficult to do research in this area because the condition is not very common and varies a lot between people. Future research is needed to compare these treatments to help patients and doctors make better decisions.\n\n**What is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm?**\n\nThe aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge or swelling in the part of the aorta that runs through your tummy.\n\nThese bulges can become 'complex' when they are very close to the arteries that supply blood to important organs like the kidneys. This makes them more difficult and risky to repair. If an aneurysm is not treated, it can burst, which is a life-threatening emergency.\n\n**How are complex AAAs treated?**\n\nTreatment options for complex AAAs include:\n\n– Open surgery, where a surgeon makes a large cut in the tummy to repair the aorta.\n– Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which is a special type of keyhole surgery. A surgeon inserts a tube (called a stent-graft) into the aorta through small cuts in the groin. The graft has custom-made holes or scallops that line up with the arteries to the kidneys and other organs, allowing blood to keep flowing to them.\n– Conservative management, which means not having surgery and instead monitoring the aneurysm with regular scans.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if FEVAR is better or worse than open surgery or conservative management for people with complex AAAs. We were interested in the effects on:\n\n– survival rates;\n– kidney problems;\n– quality of life;\n– length of hospital stay;\n– and any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies where people were randomly put into groups to receive either FEVAR, open surgery, or conservative management. This type of study provides the most reliable evidence. We planned to compare and summarize the results of these studies.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe did not find any studies that met our requirements.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe main limitation is that we found no suitable studies. Without this research, we cannot draw any conclusions about which treatment is best for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. This means that patients and doctors do not have high-quality evidence to help them choose a treatment.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
