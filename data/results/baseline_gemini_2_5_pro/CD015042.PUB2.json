We found no studies that looked at using medicines for this purpose.\n\n– Talking therapies probably make little to no difference to the number of women who stay in treatment. We do not know if these therapies help women reduce the amount they drink if they do not stop completely, because the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies reported on any unwanted effects.\n\n– More research is needed to be more certain about the effects of talking therapies. Future studies should also look at the safety and benefits of medicines for pregnant women who drink alcohol, especially for those who drink heavily.\n\nWhat is the problem with drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\nDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can be harmful to an unborn baby and can cause lifelong problems. Despite these known harms, about 1 in 10 pregnant women worldwide drink alcohol. In Europe, this number is higher, at around 1 in 4. It is important to find effective ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce their drinking.\n\nWhat treatments can help pregnant women stop drinking?\n\nThere are two main types of treatment that could help.\n– Talking therapies (also called psychosocial interventions) include things like counseling, support sessions, and motivational advice from a healthcare worker.\n– Medicines can also be used to help people with alcohol problems, but it is important to know if they are safe and effective to use during pregnancy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if talking therapies or medicines help pregnant women to stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We also wanted to know if these treatments had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared talking therapies or medicines with usual care or no treatment for pregnant women who drink alcohol. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies that included 1369 pregnant women. All 8 studies looked at talking therapies. We did not find any studies that looked at using medicines.\n\nThe talking therapies were usually brief, involving one to five short sessions with a healthcare worker. Most studies took place in the USA. The women in the comparison groups received usual care, which included advice to stop drinking.\n\nMain results\n\nCompared with usual care, we found that:\n– talking therapies may help more women to stop drinking alcohol completely.\n– talking therapies probably make little to no difference to the number of women who stay in treatment until the end.\n– we do not know if talking therapies help women to drink less alcohol if they do not stop completely. The evidence for this is very uncertain.\n– none of the studies reported on unwanted effects, so we do not know if the talking therapies have any risks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence. This is because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, some of the studies were small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
