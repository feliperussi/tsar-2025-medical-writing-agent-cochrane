They probably cause less long-term pain but may lead to a slightly lower quality of life. The number of women who have problems with the surgical mesh or difficulty emptying their bladder is similar between the two groups.\n\n– For other types of surgery, the evidence is less clear. Single-incision slings may be as effective as retropubic slings, but we are uncertain about the risk of unwanted effects. We do not know how they compare to slings made from a woman's own body tissue because there was not enough information.\n\n– More long-term research is needed to better understand the safety and effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other surgeries.\n\n**What is stress urinary incontinence?**\n\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure on the bladder. This can happen when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exercise. It is a common condition in women and can have a big impact on their quality of life.\n\n**How is stress urinary incontinence treated?**\n\nTreatments can include pelvic floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes, and surgery. One type of surgery uses a 'sling', which is a small piece of tape that supports the tube that carries urine out of the body (the urethra). This helps to stop leakage.\n\nSingle-incision slings are a type of surgery that uses a short piece of synthetic material (mesh). They are called 'single-incision' because the surgeon only needs to make one small cut inside the vagina to place the sling. Other types of slings require more cuts.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how single-incision slings compare to other treatments for stress urinary incontinence in women. We were interested in both the benefits (improving or curing leakage) and the risks, such as:\n\n– long-term pain\n– pain during sex\n– problems with the mesh material\n– difficulty emptying the bladder\n– needing another surgery\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for stress urinary incontinence. The studies had to randomly place women into different treatment groups, as this provides the most reliable evidence. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 62 studies that included 8051 women. The studies compared single-incision slings to three other types of sling surgery. We did not find any studies that compared single-incision slings to no treatment or non-surgical treatments.\n\n**Single-incision sling compared to transobturator sling (51 studies)**\nThis was the most common comparison. After one year, single-incision slings and transobturator slings make little to no difference in improving urinary leakage.\n\nCompared to transobturator slings, single-incision slings:\n– probably reduce the risk of long-term pain (lasting more than two years).\n– make little to no difference to the risk of problems with the mesh.\n– probably make little to no difference to the risk of being unable to empty the bladder after surgery.\n– may result in a slightly lower quality of life after one year.\n\nWe are uncertain if single-incision slings affect the risk of pain during sex or the need for another surgery.\n\n**Single-incision sling compared to retropubic sling (10 studies)**\nSingle-incision slings may make little to no difference in improving urinary leakage after one year compared to retropubic slings. We are uncertain about the risks of mesh problems, difficulty emptying the bladder, or needing another surgery because the evidence was not clear.\n\n**Single-incision sling compared to autologous fascial sling (1 study)**\nThis type of sling is made from a woman's own body tissue instead of synthetic mesh. We do not know if single-incision slings are better or worse than autologous fascial slings. The one small study did not provide enough information on benefits or risks.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence varied. We are confident about the results when comparing single-incision slings to transobturator slings. However, our confidence is lower for the comparisons with retropubic and autologous fascial slings. This is because some studies were very small, and in some cases, it was possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
