  "text": "What are the benefits and risks of using a TENS machine for period pain?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Using a TENS machine (a device that sends small electrical pulses to the body) may help reduce period pain compared to a fake treatment or no treatment. It is not clear if TENS causes any unwanted effects because the studies did not report on this well.\n\n– We do not know if one type of TENS is better than another for period pain. We also do not know if TENS works better or worse than other treatments like painkillers.\n\n– Future studies should be better designed. They should also look at whether using a TENS machine helps people carry on with their daily activities or reduces their need for other painkillers.\n\n**What is period pain?**\n\nPeriod pain, also known as menstrual cramps, is a common problem for many women. The pain is usually felt in the lower belly and can sometimes spread to the back and thighs. While for some women it is a mild discomfort, for others it can be severe enough to interfere with daily life.\n\nCommon treatments include painkillers, but some people look for treatments that do not involve taking medicines.\n\n**What is a TENS machine?**\n\nTENS stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. It is a small, battery-powered machine that has leads connected to sticky pads called electrodes. You stick the pads directly on to your skin. When the machine is switched on, small electrical pulses are sent to the affected area of your body.\n\nThese pulses may help to reduce pain by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain and by helping the body release its own natural painkillers, called endorphins. TENS can be set to a high frequency (fast pulses) or a low frequency (slow pulses).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using a TENS machine is better than a fake (placebo) treatment, no treatment, or other treatments for reducing period pain. We also wanted to know if TENS has any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared TENS with a fake treatment, no treatment, or other treatments in women with period pain. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 20 studies that included a total of 585 women with period pain. The studies compared high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS with a fake treatment, no treatment, or other common treatments for period pain.\n\n**Main results**\n\n*   **TENS compared to a fake treatment or no treatment**\n    Both high-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with a fake treatment or no treatment. We are not sure if TENS causes unwanted effects because very few studies reported on this.\n\n*   **High-frequency TENS compared to low-frequency TENS**\n    We are uncertain if high-frequency TENS is better or worse than low-frequency TENS for pain relief.\n\n*   **TENS compared to other treatments**\n    We do not know if TENS is better or worse than other treatments like acupressure or painkillers (such as acetaminophen) for reducing pain. There may be little to no difference in unwanted effects between high-frequency TENS and common painkillers called NSAIDs.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in our findings. This is because of concerns about how the studies were carried out. For example, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, many of the studies were very small.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",
