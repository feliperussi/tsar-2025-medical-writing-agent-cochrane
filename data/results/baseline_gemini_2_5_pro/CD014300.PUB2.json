However, it is not clear if this support helps children and teenagers.\n\n– We are not confident in these findings because there were not enough good-quality studies to draw firm conclusions.\n\n– More and better research is needed to understand if this type of support is helpful for people affected by major crises, and what kinds of support work best.\n\n**What are humanitarian crises and how do they affect mental health?**\n\nHumanitarian crises are events like wars, conflicts, or natural disasters that force people from their homes and put them in very difficult situations. Around 84 million people worldwide have been forced to leave their homes, and most live in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLiving through these crises causes many different kinds of stress, which can harm a person's mental health. Good mental health is not just about the absence of illness; it is also about feeling well, being able to cope with daily life, and having a good quality of life. Psychological and social support programs aim to help people improve these positive parts of their mental health.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychological and social support programs help improve the mental well-being of adults and children living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We compared these programs to situations where people received no support, usual care, or were on a waiting list for support.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance, which helps to make the comparison fair. We looked for studies that compared psychological and social support with no support or usual care. We then compared and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 13 studies that included a total of 7917 people. Nine studies focused on children or teenagers, and four focused on adults. The studies took place in countries such as Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nepal. On average, the support programs lasted for 18 weeks.\n\nIn all the studies, the support was given to groups of people. It was usually provided by 'paraprofessionals'. These are people who are trained to give support but are not doctors or psychologists. The studies were mostly funded by universities or non-governmental organizations (charities).\n\n**Main results for children and teenagers**\n\n– It is unclear if psychological and social support has an effect on the mental well-being of children and teenagers.\n\n– The support may make little to no difference to how children and teenagers behave socially with others.\n\n– It may improve their ability to function in daily life, but we are very uncertain about this result because it is based on only one small study.\n\n**Main results for adults**\n\n– Psychological and social support may slightly improve the mental well-being of adults by the end of the support program.\n\n– However, this improvement may not last over time. The support may make little to no difference to mental well-being a few months later.\n\n– No studies looked at how the support affected adults' daily functioning or social behaviour.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because:\n\n– there were very few studies available to review;\n– the studies often included small numbers of people;\n– there were some problems with how the studies were carried out; and\n– the studies were very different from each other in the types of support they used and the people they included.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the benefits of psychological and social support for people in these situations.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
