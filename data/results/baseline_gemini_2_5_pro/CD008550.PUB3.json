Using different doses of the same medicine may make little to no difference.\n– More and better-quality research is needed. Future studies should follow children for longer and include specific groups, such as premature babies and children with disabilities affecting their brain or nerves.\n\n**What is acid reflux in babies and children?**\n\nAcid reflux, also known as gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), is a common condition where stomach contents travel back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). It affects about half of all babies under three months old. For most babies, it is a temporary problem that gets better as they grow up.\n\nSometimes, the reflux is more severe and causes distressing symptoms like pain, poor feeding, or poor weight gain. When this happens, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Older children can also have GORD.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if medicines help treat acid reflux in babies and children. We also wanted to know if these medicines cause any unwanted or harmful effects. This review is an update of a previous review.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines for acid reflux against a dummy treatment (placebo) or another medicine. The studies included babies and children up to 16 years old.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors like how the studies were done and how many people took part.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 36 studies that included 2251 babies and children. However, we were only able to use the results from 14 of these studies because the others did not report enough information. Because the studies were very different from each other, we could not combine their results.\n\nWe looked at the results for babies and older children separately. The main medicines studied were proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which work by reducing the amount of acid the stomach makes. Examples include omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole.\n\n**Babies (up to 12 months old)**\n\n– When compared with a dummy treatment, it is unclear if omeprazole or esomeprazole have an effect on reflux symptoms like crying or fussing.\n\n**Older children (1 to 16 years old)**\n\n– It is unclear if PPIs like rabeprazole and pantoprazole improve reflux symptoms in older children.\n– Using different doses of these medicines may make little to no difference to symptoms.\n\nThe studies did not provide enough information for us to be able to assess other medicines or to understand the risk of unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because the studies we found were very different from each other. For example, they included different groups of children and measured reflux symptoms in different ways.\n\nAlso, many studies did not report their results in a way that we could use in our review. This means we cannot be certain about the effects of these medicines for treating acid reflux in babies and children.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
