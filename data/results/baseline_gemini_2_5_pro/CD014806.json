No major unwanted effects were reported.\n\n– It is unclear how sugar water compares to other comfort measures like breastfeeding, using a pacifier (a dummy), or skin-to-skin contact for reducing pain. For some other comfort measures, like giving another type of sugar (glucose), there may be little to no difference in pain relief.\n\n– More good-quality research is needed to be certain about how sugar water compares to other comfort measures for relieving pain in newborns.\n\nWhat is a heel prick test?\n\nNewborn babies often need to have a small prick made on their heel to get a drop of blood for testing. This is a common and necessary medical procedure, but it can be painful for the baby.\n\nIt is important to find simple and safe ways to reduce this pain and make the experience as comfortable as possible for babies. One method that has been studied is giving a baby a small amount of sugar water just before the procedure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving sugar water (sucrose) to newborn babies is an effective way to reduce pain during a heel prick.\n\nWe also wanted to compare sugar water with other comfort measures, such as:\n– plain water or no treatment\n– using a pacifier\n– giving another type of sugar (glucose)\n– breastfeeding or giving expressed breast milk\n– skin-to-skin contact with a parent\n– other methods like acupuncture or holding the baby in a curled-up position (facilitated tucking)\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared giving sugar water to newborn babies with other comfort measures for a heel prick. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 55 studies that included a total of 6273 newborn babies. The studies included both babies born on time (full-term) and babies born early (preterm).\n\n**Sugar water compared to plain water or no treatment**\nGiving babies sugar water probably reduces their pain scores shortly after a heel prick compared to giving them plain water or nothing.\n\n**Sugar water compared to other comfort measures**\n– Giving sugar water may make little to no difference to pain compared to giving another type of sugar (glucose), expressed breast milk, or having skin-to-skin contact with a parent.\n\n– We do not know if sugar water is better or worse than using a pacifier, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or holding the baby in a tucked position. The evidence for these comparisons was very uncertain.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\nThe studies reported only minor unwanted effects from giving sugar water, and none of them required any treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident that sugar water reduces pain compared to doing nothing. However, our confidence in the evidence for many of the other comparisons is low or very low. This is because many of the studies were small, and their results were not always consistent with each other. This makes it difficult to be certain about the true effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
