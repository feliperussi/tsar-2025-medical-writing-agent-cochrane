They also may have little to no effect on the risk of stroke or major bleeding.\n– More research is needed to compare different types of organised care, such as those using mobile health technology. We also need more studies to be more certain about the results.\n\n**What is atrial fibrillation?**\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common heart condition that causes an irregular and often very fast heartbeat. It can affect adults of any age but becomes more common as people get older. Managing atrial fibrillation can be complex because it increases the risk of other health problems, like stroke.\n\n**What are organised care services?**\n\nTo improve care for people with atrial fibrillation, some hospitals and clinics have created special organised care services. These services often involve a team of different healthcare professionals, such as doctors, specialist nurses, and pharmacists, working together. They focus on providing coordinated and complete care. Some of these services also use technology, like mobile phone apps, to help people manage their condition. This is different from 'usual care', which may be less coordinated.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if these organised care services are better than usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation. We were interested in the effects on:\n\n– death from any cause;\n– being admitted to hospital;\n– stroke and bleeding;\n– quality of life.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared organised care services with usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 8 studies that included 8205 people with atrial fibrillation. The average age of people in the studies was between 60 and 73 years. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia.\n\nThe organised care services in the studies were either led by a specialist nurse working as part of a team or used mobile health apps to help manage the condition.\n\n**Main results**\n\nCompared to usual care, we found that organised care services:\n\n– probably cause a large reduction in death from any cause;\n– reduce the number of people admitted to hospital for heart-related problems;\n– probably make little to no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital for any reason;\n– may not reduce the number of deaths from heart-related problems;\n– may have little to no effect on the risk of complications like stroke;\n– may have little to no effect on the risk of major bleeding.\n\nNone of the studies reported on minor bleeding events.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because, in the studies, it is likely that people were aware of which type of care they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Also, we did not find many studies to be certain about all of our outcomes.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
