We are very uncertain about whether these medicines improve a person's ability to stay awake when measured by special tests, or if they improve quality of life.\n\n– All the studies we found were short, lasting only up to 4 weeks.\n\n– More and better studies are needed to understand the long-term benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n**What is myotonic dystrophy?**\n\nMyotonic dystrophy is a long-term genetic condition that causes muscles to become weak and waste away. It can also cause other problems in the body. One of the most common and difficult symptoms is severe daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia.\n\n**Why is treating severe daytime sleepiness important?**\n\nSevere daytime sleepiness can greatly affect a person's daily life, making it hard to work, study, or be safe. Psychostimulants are a type of medicine that makes people feel more awake and alert. Doctors sometimes use these medicines to treat sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if psychostimulants are better than a placebo (a dummy pill) for treating severe daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We also wanted to know if these medicines cause any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared psychostimulants with a placebo in adults with myotonic dystrophy and severe daytime sleepiness. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also assessed how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 136 people. The people in the studies were adults between 18 and 70 years old. All the studies were short and only followed people for up to 4 weeks.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n– **Feeling of sleepiness:** Psychostimulants may reduce sleepiness when people rate their own symptoms on a questionnaire called the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\n\n– **Ability to stay awake:** We do not know if psychostimulants have an effect on a person's ability to stay awake when measured by special tests in a clinic.\n\n– **Quality of life:** We do not know if psychostimulants affect a person's quality of life.\n\n– **Unwanted effects:** Psychostimulants may increase the risk of unwanted effects. The studies did not give much detail about what these effects were.\n\nNone of the studies looked at the long-term effects of these medicines.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the results of the studies were different from each other, and the studies were very small and included only a few people. Also, all the studies only looked at the effects of these medicines for a short time. This means we cannot be certain about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
