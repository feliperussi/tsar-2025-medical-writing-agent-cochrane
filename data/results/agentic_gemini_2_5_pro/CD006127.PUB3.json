However, this may cause unwanted episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension).\n- There was not enough evidence to show that controlling blood pressure slows down diabetic retinopathy once it has started. The benefit is also less clear for people with diabetes who have normal blood pressure.\n- Future research should focus on whether controlling blood pressure is helpful for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure, and whether it can slow the worsening of diabetic retinopathy in people who already have the condition.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and can controlling blood pressure help?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common eye problem for people with diabetes. It can lead to vision loss and even blindness. It is well known that controlling blood sugar levels is important to prevent this eye problem from starting or getting worse. Some researchers believe that controlling blood pressure could also help protect the eyes, but different studies have found different results.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to review the existing research to find out if treatments to control blood pressure in people with diabetes help with their eye health. Specifically, we wanted to know if these treatments could prevent diabetic retinopathy from starting, slow it from getting worse, or help people keep their vision. We also looked at any unwanted effects, the impact on quality of life, and the costs of the treatments.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of more intense blood pressure control with less intense control or no treatment in people with diabetes. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 29 studies with 27,185 people who had type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with or without high blood pressure. The studies compared more intense blood pressure control with less intense control. We found that more intense control probably slightly reduces the chances of developing eye disease (retinopathy) over five years. However, for people who already have diabetic retinopathy, more intensive control probably makes little to no difference in slowing its progression. We do not know if it has an effect on significant vision loss. More intensive blood pressure control may cause a large increase in episodes of low blood pressure but probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies included different types of people and used different treatments. There were also not enough studies for us to be certain about the results for all outcomes.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to September 2021.",
