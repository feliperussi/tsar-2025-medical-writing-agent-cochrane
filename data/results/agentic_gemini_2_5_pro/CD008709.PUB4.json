It is a common condition in women that can greatly affect their health and daily life. One way to treat this is with an operation called a 'single-incision sling'. This is a minimally-invasive surgery. A surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder). This tape supports the urethra to prevent leaks. However, many countries limit the use of this type of synthetic mesh for women's health problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for women with urinary incontinence. We also wanted to understand their risks and compare their costs and benefits to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where researchers randomly put people into treatment groups. These studies give the most trustworthy evidence. We gathered and combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors like how the studies were done and how similar their results were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence, or incontinence that was mainly stress-related. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings likely improve incontinence just as much. They also probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they may lead to a lower quality of life.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may improve incontinence by a similar amount. For many other outcomes, like the need for another operation, it was unclear if single-incision slings were better or worse than the other types.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of weaknesses in how some studies were designed or carried out. Also, some evidence comes from a small number of studies and does not cover the long-term results that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
