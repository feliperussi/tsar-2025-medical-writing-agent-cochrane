The evidence for this benefit is strongest when looking only at the highest-quality studies.\n– The antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n– Our confidence in some results is low because some studies were not run well. For example, many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed.\n\nBackground\nWhat happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this can cause infection. Doctors give antibiotics to women who show signs of infection. However, it is not clear if women without signs of infection should also receive antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infection (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if prophylactic antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure for a miscarriage.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 4371 women. The women were having procedures for a miscarriage and did not show signs of infection. The studies compared preventative antibiotics with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the benefits and harms of preventative antibiotics?\nWhen we looked at all 6 studies, the results suggested that preventative antibiotics may reduce the risk of a womb infection, but we have low confidence in this finding. However, when we looked only at the 3 studies that were run best (those with a 'low risk of bias'), the evidence was much stronger. These studies showed that antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43%, and we are confident in this result.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, these antibiotics:\n– probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– may increase the risk of an allergic reaction, but the evidence for this is uncertain.\n\nWe do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or to be hospitalised to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in some results is low because the researchers did not run some studies well. For example, in some studies many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
