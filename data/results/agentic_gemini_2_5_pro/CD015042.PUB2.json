The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of these therapies.\n- The review found no studies that looked at the effects of medicines for helping pregnant people stop or drink less alcohol.\n- More research is needed to understand the effects and safety of both talking therapies and medicines, especially for pregnant people with more severe drinking problems (known as alcohol use disorder).\n\nWhy is it important to address drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\nDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can be harmful to the unborn baby. Despite the known risks, it is common for people to drink alcohol while pregnant, with about 1 in 10 doing so globally. To help pregnant people stop or reduce their drinking, different types of support can be offered. These include talking therapies, such as counselling or brief advice sessions (known as psychosocial interventions), and medications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective psychosocial interventions and medications are at helping pregnant people to stop or reduce drinking alcohol.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial support or medications with usual care for helping pregnant people stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 1369 pregnant people who consumed alcohol. Six studies were conducted in the USA, one in Spain, and one in the Netherlands. In some studies, many participants had more severe drinking problems, known as alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n\nAll studies assessed brief talking therapies (psychosocial interventions), which ranged from a single 10- to 60-minute session to five 10-minute sessions. These interventions were compared to usual care. We did not find any studies that assessed medications for this purpose.\n\nBrief talking therapies may increase the number of pregnant people who stop drinking alcohol completely. However, these interventions probably make little to no difference to the number of people who complete the treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these interventions on the number of drinks consumed per day. We do not know if these interventions cause any unwanted effects because none of the included studies reported on this.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they received, which could affect the results. Some studies also did not provide data on all the outcomes we were interested in. Finally, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
