  "text": "What are the different ways to provide community eye care for correctable vision problems?\n\nKey messages\n- The review identified several ways to provide eye care for correctable vision problems in community settings, such as school-based programs, outreach clinics, and vision centres. However, due to a lack of studies evaluating these approaches, their benefits and potential harms are unclear.\n- Future research is needed to evaluate how effective these different ways of delivering eye care are in order to help communities decide which approaches work best.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error?\nRefractive error is a very common eye condition that causes blurred vision because the eye cannot focus light correctly. It is a leading cause of vision impairment across the globe. For most people, this problem can be easily corrected with a pair of glasses. However, many people do not have access to the eye tests and glasses they need. To solve this, global health experts are looking for better ways to provide eye care services in local places like schools, pharmacies, and community health centres.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify the different ways that eye tests and glasses are provided to people in community and primary care settings. We also wanted to find out how these different approaches have been evaluated to see how well they work.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies and reports that described different ways of providing eye tests and glasses in community and primary care settings, and we summarized the different approaches we found.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review authors found 402 records describing different ways of providing eye care, such as eye tests and glasses, in community and primary care settings. These included services based in schools, pharmacies, and health centres, as well as outreach and door-to-door programs. However, the authors found very few studies that evaluated how well these different approaches work. Therefore, we do not know how effective these different ways of delivering eye care are.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review includes evidence found up to November 2022.",
