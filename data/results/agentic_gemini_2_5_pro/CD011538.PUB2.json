When children and young people have a chronic health condition, it can affect their well-being and make it hard to attend school regularly. Missing school can cause students to fall behind in their schoolwork and feel disconnected from their learning, which can lead them to disengage from school. Education support services aim to help these students stay connected to school and keep up with their learning, especially when they miss school due to their illness.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education support services are effective for children and young people with chronic health conditions. We wanted to know if these services help students engage more with school and achieve better academic results (schoolwork and grades).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested if educational support services helped children and young people with chronic health conditions to engage more with school and achieve better academic results. We summarized what these studies found and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 4 randomised controlled studies with a total of 359 children and young people aged 4 to 18 years with chronic health conditions (cancer or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)). The studies assessed educational support services. We are uncertain whether education support helps students engage more with school, achieve better academic results, or transition back to school. However, education support may slightly improve mental health. The review did not find any studies that measured quality of life or any harmful effects.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. We found only 4 small studies, which is not enough to be certain about the results. Also, the evidence focused only on children with cancer or ADHD, so the results may not apply to children with other long-term health conditions. Finally, because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, they might have reported their feelings differently, which could have affected the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to February 2021.",
