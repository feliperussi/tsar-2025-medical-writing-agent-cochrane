The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not report this clearly.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF against several alternatives: a placebo (dummy treatment), fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth), sealants (a protective coating), and a special type of filling. Some studies also compared different ways of applying SDF. Compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, some studies were too small to provide reliable conclusions.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
