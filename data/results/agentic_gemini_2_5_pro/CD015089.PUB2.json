However, the evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain. The review did not report on any harmful effects from the tests.\n- More high-quality research is needed to confirm how accurate these tests are. Future studies should test how well different healthcare professionals can use these tests. They should also compare the tests directly with other methods, like MRI scans (a type of body scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images).\n\nWhy is it important to find the cause of sudden, severe dizziness?\nDizziness is a common reason people seek medical help. A specific type of severe dizziness is called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), which can involve intense vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea, and unsteadiness. AVS can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (a 'peripheral' cause) or a more serious problem in the brain, such as a stroke (a 'central' cause). It is very important to tell the difference between these two causes because they require different treatments and have different outcomes.\n\nWhat is the HINTS test?\nThe HINTS test is a 3-part physical test that clinicians can use to help find the cause of AVS. It involves:\n– checking how the eyes move when the head is turned quickly (head impulse);\n– looking at the direction of involuntary, jerky eye movements (nystagmus); and\n– checking if the eyes are properly aligned with each other (test of skew).\nA variation called the HINTS Plus test also includes a hearing test.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests identify a 'central' cause (a problem in the brain) for people with acute vestibular syndrome. We also looked at whether using video to assist with the test made a difference to its accuracy.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests identify a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. We combined the results of these studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants (981 women and 1043 men) with a mean age of 60 years. The studies tested how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests diagnosed a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department setting. When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests may be good for diagnosing a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Using video to help with the HINTS Plus test probably correctly identifies most people who have a central cause, but it may also wrongly suggest a central cause in many people who do not have one. It is unclear how accurate the HINTS test is when using video assistance. Overall, there was not enough high-quality information to be certain about these results, or to know how the tests perform in different situations or when used by different types of healthcare providers.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up-to-date to September 2022.",
