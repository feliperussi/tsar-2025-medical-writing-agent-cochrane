The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may affect a child's behaviour and how they develop language skills. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. This technique creates pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective autoinflation is for treating glue ear in children. We were interested in both the benefits (such as improved hearing) and any potential harms (such as ear pain).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with fluid in the middle ear. We compared and summarized the results from the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. In most studies, children used the treatment for 2 to 12 weeks, and researchers checked the results shortly after.\n\nAutoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after 3 months. This means that for every 1000 children with persistent fluid, 89 fewer might have it if they use autoinflation. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal.\n\nAlthough ear pain was uncommon, it may be more likely with autoinflation. About 4 in 100 children using it reported ear pain, compared to about 1 in 100 children who had no treatment. However, this evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot be sure of this effect. Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the treatment regularly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
