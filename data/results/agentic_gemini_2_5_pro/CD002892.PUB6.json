  "text": "Can programs aimed at individual healthcare workers reduce work-related stress?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs for individual healthcare workers may reduce work-related stress for up to a year. This includes programs that help workers focus on their experience of stress (like changing their thoughts) and those that help them focus away from stress (like relaxation or exercise). The studies did not provide information about any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- However, the evidence is not strong, and we do not know the long-term effects (beyond 1 year). We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the benefits and to understand how best to support healthcare workers.\n\nWhy is work-related stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers can experience work-related stress when there is an imbalance between the demands of their job, their skills, and the support they receive at work. This can lead to burnout (emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion), other health problems, and may affect the quality of care they provide to patients.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different programs reduce stress for individual healthcare workers. We compared these programs to no program, being on a waitlist, or a different type of stress-reduction program.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that tested programs to reduce stress for individual healthcare workers. We grouped the programs by type, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 117 studies with 11,119 healthcare workers, which tested different types of programs to reduce stress.\n\nWe found that some programs may reduce stress for up to a year. These include programs that help people focus on their experience of stress (for example, by changing their thoughts) and those that help them focus away from it (such as relaxation or exercise). A combination of different programs may also reduce stress in the short term.\n\nHowever, we are uncertain about the effects of programs that aim to change work-related factors. The long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of any of these programs are unknown, and it is unclear if one type is better than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies often knew which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
