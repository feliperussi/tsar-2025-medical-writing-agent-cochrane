  "text": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs combining healthy eating and physical activity likely cause a small reduction in children's weight after about a year.\n- Programs focused only on physical activity likely have a similar small effect after about a year.\n- Programs focused only on diet likely make little to no difference. The effects of any program may not last long-term.\n- There was not enough information to be certain about serious unwanted effects, like injuries. More research is needed on programs outside of schools and for children with disabilities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can seriously affect a child's health, development, and well-being. To prevent obesity, many programs encourage children to build healthier habits. These programs aim to help children eat healthier, be more active, sleep better, and sit less.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs focusing on diet, physical activity, or both can prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. We looked at how these programs affected body weight measures, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects, like injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies with 189,707 children. The children’s average age was between 5 and 11 years. Most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no program or usual care. They lasted from a single visit up to 4 years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most studies (132) did not receive funding from companies, while 24 did.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nThe studies checked on children at different times: in the short-term (up to 9 months), medium-term (9 to 15 months), and long-term (more than 15 months).\n\nCompared to taking no action:\n- Programs combining diet and physical activity likely cause a small reduction in children's weight in the medium-term (9 to 15 months). They may cause a small reduction in the short-term.\n- Programs focused only on physical activity likely cause a small reduction in weight in the medium-term. They may make little to no difference in the short-term.\n- Programs focused only on diet likely make little to no difference at any time.\n\nWe found little to no effect for any program in the long-term (more than 15 months). There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because the results from the studies were inconsistent. When studies test many different programs in various groups of children, it makes it harder to draw firm conclusions about what works best. There was also very little information for certain groups, such as children with disabilities, or for programs run outside of schools.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
