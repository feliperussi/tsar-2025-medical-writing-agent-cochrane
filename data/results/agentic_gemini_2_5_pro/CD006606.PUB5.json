Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs to collect. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies, called randomised controlled trials, where women with PCOS were randomly chosen to receive either IVM or standard IVF. We then combined the results from these studies and rated how certain we were about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. Out of 100 pregnancies from IVF, about 20 may end in miscarriage. For every 100 pregnancies from IVM, this number is between 20 and 40. IVM greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). For every 1000 women who have IVF, about 35 may develop moderate or severe OHSS. With IVM, that number drops to between 0 and 24 women. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of babies being born too early (preterm birth). It may also make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe reliability of the evidence varies. The evidence for the chance of having a baby is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, the evidence is reliable for the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
