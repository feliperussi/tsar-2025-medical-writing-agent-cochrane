Breakthrough pain is pain that needs extra attention from an anaesthesiologist (a specialist pain doctor). This method also uses less pain-relieving medicine.\n- The delivery method did not seem to affect a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (a birth using forceps or a vacuum device). Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. The two methods did not differ in their effect on the baby's health immediately after birth.\n- We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves an anaesthesiologist placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. They can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic, timed injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic, timed injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We wanted to know which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the need for a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that included a total of 4590 healthy women. In 13 studies, the women were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic, timed injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, automatic, timed injections for an epidural probably reduce the need for an anaesthesiologist to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women using a continuous drip, 28 might need extra help for pain, compared to only 20 women using automatic, timed injections. Automatic, timed injections also probably reduce the amount of pain relief medicine women use and may improve a mother's satisfaction with her pain relief. The delivery method probably makes little to no difference to the number of caesarean or instrumental deliveries, or to the length of labour.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, women or staff knew which pain relief method they were using, which might have influenced the results. The studies also used different types of pain relief medicine and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. We searched for evidence up to December 2022.",
