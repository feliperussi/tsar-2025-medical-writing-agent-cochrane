  "text": "Are psychostimulants (stimulant medicines) helpful for excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nKey messages\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy who have excessive daytime sleepiness, it is very uncertain whether stimulant medicines improve wakefulness when measured by laboratory tests. However, these medicines may help people feel less sleepy based on their own rating on a questionnaire, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects.\nAll the evidence comes from short-term studies (lasting up to 4 weeks). Longer and larger studies are needed to better understand the benefits and safety of using stimulant medicines for longer periods.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a long-term condition that causes muscle weakness and other health problems. A common and difficult symptom for people with myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness (also known as hypersomnia). To treat this sleepiness, doctors sometimes use a type of medicine called a psychostimulant, which aims to help people feel more awake and alert.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what effects psychostimulants have on excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We looked for studies that compared these medicines to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychostimulants with a placebo for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 6 studies with a total of 136 adult outpatients (between 18 and 70 years old) with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. The studies were short-term, lasting up to 4 weeks, and compared psychostimulants to a placebo or no treatment. No studies were found that evaluated the effects in the long term. For people with myotonic dystrophy, it is very uncertain if psychostimulants improve wakefulness when measured by objective tests or if they improve quality of life. Psychostimulants may help reduce feelings of sleepiness as rated by the person themselves, but they may also increase the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons:\n– the studies were very small;\n– they included different types of people;\n– they used different methods for the treatment.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
