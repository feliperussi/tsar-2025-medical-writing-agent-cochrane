  "text": "Can combined medicine, diet, and exercise improve outcomes for people with cachexia?\n\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether combining treatments such as medicine, diet, and exercise helps people with cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss caused by long-term illness). The evidence was not strong enough to determine the benefits or unwanted effects of these combined treatments.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to find out if combining different types of treatments can help manage cachexia in people with various long-term illnesses.\n\nWhat is disease-related wasting (cachexia)?\nCachexia is a condition of severe weight and muscle loss, also known as 'disease-related wasting'. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia lose weight and muscle without meaning to, feel very tired, lose their appetite, and have a lower quality of life. One possible way to treat cachexia is to use several treatments at once, such as medicines, nutritional support (diet changes), and exercise. The idea is that these treatments might work better together than on their own.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a combination of treatments (known as multimodal interventions) helps to relieve or control cachexia in adults with a chronic illness. We also wanted to know if these combined treatments cause any harm or unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested treatments for cachexia using a combination of approaches, such as medicine, diet, and exercise. We compared and summarized the results of these combined treatments against usual care or single treatments, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 9 studies with a total of 926 adults with cachexia (disease-related wasting). The participants had various chronic illnesses, including cancer, COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The studies assessed a combination of treatments (such as drugs, nutrition, and exercise) and compared them to usual treatment or a single treatment. The evidence is very uncertain, so for people with cachexia, we do not know if using a combination of treatments has an effect on their physical function, strength, body weight, appetite, or fatigue. It is also unclear whether these combined treatments cause more or fewer unwanted side effects.\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, most studies focused on people with cancer, so the results may not apply to those with other long-term illnesses that cause cachexia. Finally, the studies were very small.\n\nThis review includes evidence published up to July 2024.",
