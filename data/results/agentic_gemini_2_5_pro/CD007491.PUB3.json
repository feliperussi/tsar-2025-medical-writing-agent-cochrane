Patients may be more satisfied with at-home care, and the review did not find evidence of unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Hospital-at-home care probably costs less for the health service than care in a hospital.\n- Future research should look at the effects of hospital-at-home care on caregivers and find out which specific groups of older people benefit most from this type of care.\n\nWhat is 'hospital at home' and what did this review investigate?\nWhen people have an illness that requires hospital care, they are usually admitted to a hospital ward. An alternative is 'hospital at home', where healthcare professionals provide active treatment in a person's own home for a limited time. This care is for people with a condition that would otherwise require them to be admitted to a hospital.\n\nWe wanted to compare 'hospital at home' with care in a hospital to see which was more effective and if it cost less.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials that compared 'hospital at home' with care in a hospital. In these studies, people are assigned to a treatment group by chance, which provides the most reliable evidence. We collected and combined the results from all the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that included a total of 3100 people. Most participants were older people with conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a long-term lung disease), stroke, or other sudden medical problems. The studies compared 'hospital at home' care with standard care in a hospital for follow-up periods of 3 to 12 months.\n\nCompared to staying in the hospital, 'hospital at home' care:\n– probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die within 6 months;\n– probably makes little to no difference to the number of people readmitted to hospital;\n– probably reduces the number of people who need to live in a care home after their illness;\n– probably costs less for the health service;\n– may improve how satisfied people are with their care; and\n– probably makes little to no difference to how people rate their own health.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about a few issues. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies were done in different types of people, and there were not enough studies to be certain about some results, such as the effects on caregivers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
