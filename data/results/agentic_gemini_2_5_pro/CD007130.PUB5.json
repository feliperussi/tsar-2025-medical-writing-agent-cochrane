This includes people recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (like bypass surgery or inserting a stent). For up to 1 year, both types of programs seem to have a similar effect on a person's risk of dying and their ability to exercise. For up to 2 years, they also appear to have a similar effect on quality of life. The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects, so we could not compare them.\n- We need more research to understand the long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of these programs. We also need to find out if home-based programs are suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) cause the most deaths worldwide. After a heart attack, a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (such as bypass surgery or having a stent inserted), or another heart problem, doctors often offer people 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These programs include exercise, education, and support to help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, people attend these programs in a group at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). To make it easier for more people to take part, researchers developed programs that people can follow at home ('home-based'). These sometimes include support from healthcare staff by phone or the internet.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if cardiac rehabilitation at home is as effective as supervised programs in a hospital or clinic. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, how well people can exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, researchers randomly assigned people to receive either home-based or centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then combined the results from all the studies and judged the reliability of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies with 3046 adults. The people in the studies had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (such as bypass surgery or having a stent inserted). The studies compared home-based recovery programs with supervised programs in a hospital or clinic. Most studies were short-term and lasted up to 12 months. Only 3 studies looked at results beyond this time.\n\nFor people with these heart conditions, recovery programs at home with support from healthcare staff seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic.\n- For up to 1 year, home-based programs may make little to no difference to a person's risk of dying or how well they can exercise.\n- For up to 2 years, they may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\nBeyond 1 year, home-based programs probably make little to no difference to how well people can exercise. A similar number of people seem to complete both home-based and centre-based programs.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because many of the included studies did not report their methods well, which makes their results less certain. We also did not find enough studies to be sure about the long-term effects of the programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is current to September 2022.",
