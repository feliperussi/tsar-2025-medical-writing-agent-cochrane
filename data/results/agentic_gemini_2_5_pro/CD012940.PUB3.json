The limited available evidence suggests that putting the milk back in may have little to no effect on important health results, such as the time it takes to regain birth weight or the risk of developing a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis).\n\nLarger, well-designed studies are needed to provide a clear answer on whether it is better to put back or throw away undigested milk for premature babies.\n\nWhat is the issue with feeding preterm infants?\n\nPreterm babies (babies born early) are often too small or weak to feed from the breast or a bottle, so they are fed through a tube that goes into their stomach. Before giving a new feed, nurses often check to see how much milk is left in the stomach from the last feed. This leftover milk is called a 'gastric residual'. Health professionals are unsure what to do with this residual. Some believe it should be returned to the baby's stomach ('re-feeding') because it contains partially digested milk and other substances that can help with digestion. Others are concerned that re-feeding might cause problems like vomiting or lead to serious conditions such as necrotising enterocolitis (a dangerous gut disease) or sepsis (a serious blood infection).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to compare the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals with throwing them away to find out which approach is safer and more effective for preterm infants.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding gastric residuals with discarding them in preterm infants. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe based this review on one trial that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals versus discarding them. Based on this one small study, re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important health outcomes. These outcomes included the time it took for infants to regain their birth weight, the risk of developing a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis), and the risk of death before leaving the hospital. Re-feeding also seemed to make little difference to the time it took to get infants fully on milk feeds, the number of days they needed intravenous feeding, and their risk of poor growth. We do not know if re-feeding has an effect on how often feeds are interrupted.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. The one available study was very small, and it is possible that the researchers and parents knew which treatment the babies received.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThis review includes evidence published up to February 2022.",
