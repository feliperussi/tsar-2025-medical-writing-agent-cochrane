The results of several ongoing studies may provide more clarity in the future.\n\nWhy is the amount of protein in infant formula important?\nMany babies are fed with infant formula, either instead of or in addition to breast milk, to help them grow and develop. Formulas can contain different amounts of protein. Some formulas have a higher protein content, which is intended to help babies gain weight more quickly during their first year. However, it is not clear whether the benefits of these higher-protein formulas outweigh any possible risks for healthy babies born on time (not prematurely).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of feeding formula with higher protein levels compared to formula with lower protein levels to healthy infants. We were particularly interested in the effects on babies' growth (including the risk of being underweight or overweight) and whether higher-protein formulas caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of feeding healthy infants formula with higher versus lower protein content. We then compared and combined the results of these studies to see what the overall evidence showed. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence based on factors like study methods and the consistency of the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 1885 healthy, full-term infants from high-income countries. These studies compared infant formulas with different levels of protein. Our analysis showed that we are very uncertain if using a high-protein formula compared to a standard-protein formula has any effect on a baby's growth. This includes their risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. High-protein formula may make little to no difference to the risk of short-term unwanted effects, such as diarrhea or vomiting. Similarly, we are very uncertain if using a standard-protein formula compared to a low-protein formula affects an infant's growth. Standard-protein formula may also make little to no difference to the risk of unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, the studies we found were small and used different types of formula and feeding schedules, which makes it difficult to compare their results. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the long-term effects on growth and health.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
