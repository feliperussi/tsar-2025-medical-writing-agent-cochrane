  "text": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines, talking therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents to stimulate the brain), alone or in combination, for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\nDue to a lack of strong evidence, the effects of most treatments for depression after a stroke are uncertain. Medicines and talking therapies may help reduce depression, but medicines may cause unwanted effects on the brain, nerves, stomach, and gut.\nBrain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents) on its own did not appear to have an effect on depression.\nMore and better-quality research is needed to understand the true benefits and harms of these treatments, both alone and in combination.\n\nWhy is treating depression after a stroke important?\nHaving a stroke is a life-changing event, and many people experience depression afterwards. This depression can make it harder for people to recover from their stroke. Unfortunately, depression after a stroke is often not identified or not treated effectively.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nIn this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments for depression after a stroke. We looked at evidence for medicines (pharmacological treatments), talking therapies (psychological therapy), non-invasive brain stimulation (using electrical currents or magnetic fields to stimulate the brain), and combinations of these treatments.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested different treatments for depression after a stroke. We compared and combined the study results to see how well the treatments worked and what harms they might cause. We also rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 65 trials with 5831 people who had depression after a stroke. The studies compared several types of treatments:\n- drug treatments, compared with a placebo (a dummy pill);\n- non-invasive brain stimulation, compared with a fake stimulation or usual care;\n- talking therapies, compared with usual care or general support that was not a specific therapy.\nThe review also looked at combinations of these treatments.\n\nWe are very uncertain about the evidence we found. It suggests that:\n- drug treatments and talking therapies may reduce the number of people with depression.\n- drug treatments may cause side effects related to the nervous system and stomach.\n- non-invasive brain stimulation on its own may have little to no effect on depression.\n\nAdding non-invasive brain stimulation to drug treatment may reduce the number of people with depression compared to using drug treatment alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
