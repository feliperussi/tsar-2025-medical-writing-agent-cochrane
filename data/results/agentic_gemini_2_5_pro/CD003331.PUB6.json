We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies we found did not clearly report if the programs caused any harm.\n\nThe benefits seem to be the same whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure (HFpEF), as past studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. There are 2 main types. In one, the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF). In the other, the muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF).\n\nThis condition can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education that aims to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, the risk of being admitted to the hospital, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, which assign people to treatment groups by chance. These studies compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and judged how reliable the overall evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the 'weak heart' type of failure (HFrEF) with mild to moderate symptoms. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure (HFpEF). Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home or used digital support. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. For example, out of 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital. This compares to probably only 16 out of 100 people who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably improves quality of life in an important way. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for 2 main reasons.\n\nFirst, the results may not apply to everyone with heart failure. Most people in the studies were men with the 'weak heart' type of failure. The studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type.\n\nSecond, the results for quality of life might be unreliable. In many studies, people knew they were in the exercise group. Knowing this might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being, which could make the programs seem better than they really were.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
