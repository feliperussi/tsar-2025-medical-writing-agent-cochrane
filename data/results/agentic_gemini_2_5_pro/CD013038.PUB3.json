The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.\n- The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and had limitations in their methods. Future, larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in babies born early.\n\nWhy do babies born early have feeding problems?\nBabies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are often not developed enough to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at once. This means they cannot feed from a breast or bottle right away. To get the nutrition they need to grow, healthcare staff feed them milk through a soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. A problem with tube feeding is that the baby misses out on the smell and taste of the milk. Researchers believe these senses play an important role in helping the body get ready to digest food. Researchers think that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if letting babies born early smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula while they received tube feeds could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving babies born early the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds against not giving it. We combined and summarized the results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved a total of 1277 babies born early. These studies compared letting infants smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula during tube feeds against not doing so. Letting babies born early smell and taste milk while they receive tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth. However, the evidence is very uncertain. This approach probably makes little to no difference to the risk of developing a late infection. It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition they receive through a vein (parenteral nutrition) or to the risk of a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis). The evidence is also very uncertain about whether it affects the time it takes to reach full tube feeds. The studies did not report on whether this practice caused feeding problems (known as feeding intolerance), such as vomiting or a swollen belly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because in some studies, parents and healthcare staff may have known which treatment the babies received, which could have influenced the results. Also, the studies were small and used different methods.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
