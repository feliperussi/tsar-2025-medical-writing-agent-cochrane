However, it may cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n- Taking the pill continuously (without the usual week-long break each month) may be better at reducing pain than taking it in the standard way.\n- Because the studies were short, the long-term effects of using the pill for painful periods are not known. It is also unclear if the pill is more effective than other common pain medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, like ibuprofen), due to a lack of studies directly comparing them.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea?\nMany women experience painful menstrual cramps, a condition known as dysmenorrhoea. It is a common and major cause of pain. This is called 'primary dysmenorrhoea' when the pain is not caused by another medical problem in the pelvis. Combined oral contraceptive pills (often called 'the pill') are a common treatment for this pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to manage primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with a placebo (a dummy pill), other contraceptive pills, or anti-inflammatory drugs for treating painful periods. We found 21 studies, known as randomised controlled trials, with a total of 3723 women.\n\nIn these studies, researchers randomly put people into one of 2 or more treatment groups to compare them. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nFor women with painful menstrual cramps, the pill reduces pain more effectively than a placebo. However, the pill comes with unwanted effects. It causes a large increase in the risk of irregular bleeding. For example, if 18 out of 100 women experience irregular bleeding with a placebo, between 39 and 60 out of 100 would experience it if they used the pill. The pill also probably increases the risk of headaches and nausea. We are uncertain if it has an effect on weight gain.\n\nWhen comparing different ways of taking the pill, continuous use (without a pill-free break) may reduce pain more effectively than the standard schedule. There is probably little to no difference in pain relief between lower and higher dose pills, or between newer and older generation pills.\n\nDue to a lack of studies, we are uncertain if the pill is more or less effective than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating menstrual pain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all health effects. The evidence also does not cover all of the effects we were interested in, such as the long-term effects of the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
