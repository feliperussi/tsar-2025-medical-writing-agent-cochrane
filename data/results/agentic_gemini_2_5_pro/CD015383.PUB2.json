People who had the therapy reported some temporary unwanted effects, like raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. These effects were not serious and went away quickly. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n– The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning. This is sometimes called 'existential distress'. Researchers are studying if psychedelic-assisted therapy can treat these feelings.\n\nThis therapy involves several steps. First, a person has therapy sessions to prepare. Then, they take a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin or LSD) in a safe setting with trained therapists. Afterwards, more therapy sessions help them understand their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that randomly put people into 2 groups. One group received psychedelic therapy and the other received a placebo ('dummy' treatment). This type of study is the best way to see if a treatment works and to be sure about the results.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using psychedelic drugs like psilocybin and LSD, or a different drug called MDMA. Groups that support this type of therapy funded the studies, not drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with psychedelic drugs like psilocybin or LSD may reduce anxiety and depression. It is unclear if the therapy helped with existential distress. The evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot be sure. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. People who had the therapy had temporary, mild to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, feeling sick, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the evidence for 2 main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, the drugs have powerful effects, so people likely knew if they received the real treatment or the placebo. This can affect the results and make them less reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2024.",
