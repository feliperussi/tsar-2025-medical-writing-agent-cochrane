The available studies also provided very little information about possible harmful effects.\n- Future studies on Ménière’s disease need to be better designed and should agree on the best ways to measure symptoms like vertigo (a spinning sensation). They should also carefully record any unwanted effects of the treatment.\n\nWhat is Ménière's disease and how is it treated?\nMénière's disease is a condition of the inner ear that causes repeated, sudden attacks of dizziness or a spinning sensation (vertigo). These attacks are also associated with hearing loss and a ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus). The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown. A number of different medicines that are taken by mouth are used to try and manage the condition and prevent the attacks. These include betahistine, diuretics (water tablets), antiviral medicines and corticosteroids. However, it is not clear how well these different treatments work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of these different medicines for people with Ménière's disease. We compared the medicines to either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment at all.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines (such as betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids) against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 10 studies with a total of 848 adults diagnosed with definite or probable Ménière's disease. The studies evaluated several drug treatments, including betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids, comparing them to either a placebo or no treatment. The review did not find any studies that assessed antihistamines. All included studies followed participants for at least 3 months. For people with Ménière's disease, it is unclear if taking these medicines by mouth has any effect on vertigo symptoms. The available evidence is not reliable enough to determine if these treatments offer any benefits or if they are associated with any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that have been done are very small. The studies also used different ways to measure the effects of the treatments, and not all of them provided data on the outcomes that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
