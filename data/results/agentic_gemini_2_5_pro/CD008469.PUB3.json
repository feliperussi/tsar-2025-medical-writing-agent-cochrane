The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- More intensive home education programs may reduce hospital admissions for asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- It is difficult to be certain about the results because the education programs in the studies were very different from one another. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. Education is a key part of managing asthma. It helps children and their families understand the condition and learn skills to manage it themselves. These skills include using an inhaler correctly and avoiding things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can happen in different places, including at home. Educating families at home may help those who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals, and it allows them to learn in a familiar place.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective educational programs delivered at home are for children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these home-based programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and judged how certain we were of the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents with asthma, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against either usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main results after 6 months.\n\nHome education compared with usual care\nCompared to usual care, providing asthma education at home may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits. It may improve a child's quality of life (a measure of their well-being). However, we have very little confidence in the evidence, so we are uncertain about these effects.\n\nMore-intensive compared with less-intensive home education\nWhen we compared more-intensive with less-intensive home education, we found that a more-intensive program may greatly reduce hospital admissions for asthma. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to teach them, making it hard to compare the results. Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
