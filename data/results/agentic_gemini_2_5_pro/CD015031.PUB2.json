The 'flap' technique may also result in better vision 3 or more months after surgery. The studies provided little information about unwanted effects.\nBecause the current findings are based on a small number of studies, larger and better-quality studies are needed to confirm whether the 'flap' technique is better for improving vision and to properly assess its safety.\n\nWhat is a large macular hole?\nThe retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The central part of the retina, called the macula, is responsible for the sharp, detailed vision needed for reading and driving. A macular hole is a small break in the macula that causes blurred and distorted central vision. This review focuses on 'large' macular holes, which are more difficult to treat successfully.\n\nHow are macular holes treated?\nThe standard surgery for a macular hole involves removing the gel-like substance from inside the eye (a vitrectomy) and then peeling away a very thin layer from the surface of the retina, called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). While this 'ILM peeling' technique often works, it is less successful at closing large macular holes. A different surgical technique, known as the 'inverted ILM flap' technique, uses this same membrane to create a flap that helps plug the hole.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the 2 surgical techniques – the newer 'flap' technique versus the standard 'peeling' technique – for treating large macular holes. We wanted to know which technique was more effective and safer for improving vision and closing the hole.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared the 'inverted flap' technique with the standard 'peeling' technique for large macular holes. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 4 studies with a total of 275 participants from India, Poland, and Mexico. Most participants were women (63%) and older, with an average age ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. All studies included people with large macular holes that had developed for no known reason (idiopathic macular holes). The follow-up period for the studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. No study disclosed financial support.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nThe studies compared the newer 'flap' technique with the standard 'peeling' technique. Compared to the standard surgery, the new surgical technique probably increases the chance of the hole closing. This new technique may also improve vision 3 months or more after surgery. It is unclear if the new technique has an effect on vision 1 month after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to December 2022.",
