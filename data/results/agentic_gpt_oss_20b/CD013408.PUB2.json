The evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– These programmes probably reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems, but they make little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, stroke or major bleeding.  \n– The studies were small, varied in design, and did not examine all possible harms. Larger, longer trials are needed to compare different models, assess costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This makes the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure and early death. As people get older, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest a team‑based approach (where nurses, pharmacists and other specialists work together) and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, which deliver health services through computers or smartphones).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care). Specifically, we asked whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared team‑based or virtual AF services with usual care. Three of us independently selected the studies, extracted the data and checked each study for bias. We combined the results and used the GRADE system, which rates how confident we are in the evidence, to assess the certainty of our findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight trials that together involved 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old and the trials were conducted in China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led team‑based model and two trials tested mHealth management; all compared the organised‑care approaches with usual care.\n\nWhat did we find about overall death?\nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause death. About three fewer people per 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care programmes compared with usual care.\n\nWhat did we find about hospital admissions?\nOrganised care probably does not change the overall number of hospital stays, but it does reduce stays that are directly related to heart problems.\n\nWhat did we find about bleeding and stroke?\nWe did not see a clear increase or decrease in serious bleeding, and the programmes probably have little or no effect on stroke or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Many participants knew which treatment they received, some studies did not report all outcomes we wanted, the trials were small, and the ways the care was delivered differed. These factors make it harder to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to April 2023, so the evidence is current to that date.",
