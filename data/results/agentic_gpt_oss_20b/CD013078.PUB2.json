  "text": "Is doing strengthening exercises helpful for treating jumper’s knee (patellar tendinopathy)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Strengthening exercises that make the knee‑supporting muscles stronger may lower pain and improve knee function, but the evidence is uncertain and no studies reported side‑effects.  \n– Compared with steroid injections (glucocorticoid injections) or surgery, strengthening exercises give similar results for pain relief, function and return to sport, although the data are limited and uncertain.  \n– The existing studies are few, small and involve mainly young male athletes; larger, well‑designed trials in broader populations and with longer follow‑up are needed.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why does it matter?\nPatellar tendinopathy, often called “jumper’s knee”, causes pain at the front of the knee where the tendon attaches the kneecap to the thigh muscle. It mainly affects people who do a lot of jumping or running, such as athletes. The pain can make everyday activities like climbing stairs or squatting difficult and can limit sports performance for months.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether strengthening exercises reduce pain, improve function and cause any harms in people with patellar tendinopathy. We compared exercise programmes with no treatment, steroid injections, surgery and other therapies such as stretching or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases up to September 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared strengthening exercise with any other intervention or with no treatment. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE system – a method that grades how confident we are in the evidence – to rate the quality of the studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified seven trials that included 211 participants with chronic jumper’s knee. All participants were athletes; 88 % were male, the average age was 26 years and symptoms had lasted about 42 months. The trials compared strengthening exercise with:\n– no treatment (3 trials, 93 participants)  \n– steroid injection (1 trial, 38 participants)  \n– surgery (1 trial, 40 participants)  \n– stretching exercise (1 trial, 15 participants)  \n– pulsed ultrasound with transverse friction (1 trial, 30 participants)  \n\nNo study compared exercise with a placebo or sham intervention, and none reported adverse events.\n\nWhat were the main results for pain and function?\n– Compared with no treatment, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain. The evidence hints at a possible reduction, but confidence is low.  \n– Strengthening exercise may improve function slightly compared with no treatment, but the effect is small and uncertain.  \n– Compared with steroid injection, strengthening exercise makes little or no difference to pain or function.  \n– Compared with surgery, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain or improves function.  \n– Strengthening exercise may increase participants’ overall assessment of treatment success compared with surgery, but the evidence is low‑certainty.  \n– Similar numbers of athletes return to sport after strengthening exercise or surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe trials were small, participants and investigators knew which treatment was given, and most studies involved only young male athletes. No trial reported harms, so we cannot assess safety. These factors make us less confident in the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nYes. Our searches covered studies published up to September 2023.",
