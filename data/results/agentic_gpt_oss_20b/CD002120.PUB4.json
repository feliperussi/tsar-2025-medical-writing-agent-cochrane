They also increase the chance of side‑effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches and nausea.  \n– Taking the pills continuously (no weekly break) may give a little more pain relief than the usual 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule, but the evidence is limited and we do not have long‑term safety data.  \n– We are fairly confident in these findings: the evidence is reliable overall, but some uncertainty remains because the studies were small, varied in design, and often did not hide the treatment from participants.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as endometriosis). It is very common and is a leading cause of missed work or school days for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The usual first‑line treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – medicines like ibuprofen that reduce pain and inflammation. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are another option because they suppress the menstrual cycle and may lessen cramps.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether OCPs are effective and safe for treating primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, we compared the benefits (pain reduction and reduced need for extra medication) and harms (irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea and any serious side‑effects) of OCPs against placebo, no treatment, other OCP regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared OCPs with placebo, other pills or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size. Our search covered studies published up to 28 March 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials that together enrolled 3 723 women. The trials compared OCPs with three types of comparators:\n– placebo or no treatment (11 trials)  \n– other OCP regimens that differed in dose, generation or schedule (9 trials)  \n– NSAIDs (1 trial)\n\nPain relief compared with placebo or no treatment  \nWomen who took OCPs reported less pain. Six trials showed that pain scores fell by an average of 0.58 standard units, which we interpret as a moderate reduction. Six other trials showed that women were about 1.6 times more likely to notice a meaningful improvement in pain. In practical terms, if about 28 % of women improve with placebo, the pill raises that proportion to roughly 37‑60 %.\n\nSide‑effects compared with placebo or no treatment  \nWomen taking OCPs were about 2.6 times as likely to experience irregular bleeding. That means roughly 40‑60 out of 100 women on the pill have spotting or bleeding between periods, compared with about 20 out of 100 who do not take the pill. The pills also increased the chance of headaches by about 1.5 times and nausea by about 1.6 times. We did not find reliable data on weight gain or serious adverse events.\n\nContinuous versus standard regimen  \nA small number of studies suggested that taking OCPs continuously (no weekly break) may lower pain a little more than the usual 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule. The average difference in pain scores was –0.73, but only two trials examined this and they did not provide long‑term safety information.\n\nComparison with NSAIDs  \nOnly one small trial compared OCPs with an NSAID. It did not show a clear advantage for the pill and did not report side‑effects, so we cannot say whether the pill works better or worse than NSAIDs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are fairly confident in these results, but the studies involved different types of women, used various pill doses, and were often small. Some trials did not hide the treatment from participants, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. No study looked at long‑term effects or serious side‑effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies identified up to 28 March 2023.",
