While on the machine, they often feel pain? Actually they often feel pain or become restless. Doctors give medicines to keep them calm (sedation) and free from pain (analgesia). The most common drugs are morphine and other strong opioids. These drugs work but can be risky, causing low blood pressure or breathing problems. Dexmedetomidine is a different type of medicine that works on “alpha‑2” receptors in the nervous system. It may calm babies without dropping blood pressure as much, and it is being used more often even though it is not officially licensed for newborns.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about dexmedetomidine?\nWe wanted to know whether dexmedetomidine is effective and safe for providing sedation and pain relief in newborns who need a breathing machine. Specifically, we planned to compare it with non‑opioid medicines, with opioids such as morphine or fentanyl, and with no active drug (placebo) to see which option works best and has the fewest harms.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched the medical literature and trial registries for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign babies to treatments) up to September 2023. We looked for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or analgesics, or with placebo, in newborns on a breathing machine. We combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies, so no babies were enrolled and we have no information about how long the studies lasted, who funded them, the babies’ characteristics, the settings, or the exact treatments used. Because no studies met our criteria, we cannot determine whether dexmedetomidine helps or harms newborns on a breathing machine.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it does not include all the babies, treatments, or outcomes we wanted, and there are too few studies to be sure of the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to September 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",
