These emotions can lower quality of life, make it harder to follow medical treatments, and increase the risk of physical complications. Standard care usually includes antidepressants or counselling, but many patients continue to experience persistent symptoms.\n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy and how might it help?\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy combines a psychedelic drug—such as psilocybin (the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”), lysergic acid di‑ethylamide (LSD), or 3,4‑methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, sometimes called “Ecstasy”)—with psychotherapy sessions before, during, and after the drug experience. The drug creates a special mental state, and therapists help the person process emotions and gain new perspectives. Researchers think this approach could reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress, although the drugs are illegal in most countries and can cause temporary side‑effects like raised blood pressure, nausea, or mild emotional upset.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy is safe and effective for people with life‑threatening diseases. Specifically, we compared the therapy with placebo or active comparators (for example, standard antidepressants) to see if it reduces anxiety, depression, and existential distress, and we recorded any harms.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and two trial registers on 30 March 2024, without language or date limits. We also checked reference lists, performed citation searches, and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials that enrolled adults with life‑threatening illnesses and measured anxiety, depression, or existential distress.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials involving 149 participants (outcome data for 140) aged 36–64 years with conditions such as cancer. The trials were conducted in outpatient settings in the United States and Switzerland and lasted 6–12 months. Funding came from organisations that support psychedelic‑assisted therapy; no drug‑company money was involved. Two types of therapy were tested: (1) classical psychedelics – psilocybin and LSD – and (2) MDMA.\n\nThe evidence suggests that psilocybin or LSD combined with psychotherapy may reduce anxiety and may also reduce depression in this population. We remain uncertain whether the therapy lowers existential distress, improves overall quality of life, or enhances spiritual experiences. Evidence for MDMA‑assisted therapy is very unclear for both anxiety and depression. No serious adverse events were reported. Minor to moderate side‑effects included temporary blood‑pressure rise, nausea, anxiety, emotional upset, jaw clenching, dry mouth, and headaches; these resolved when the drug effects wore off.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe cannot be confident in the results because many trials could not keep participants blinded, some did not report all outcomes we needed, and the sample sizes were very small. These factors increase the risk of bias and imprecision.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects studies published up to March 2024.\n\nWhat do we need next?\nWe need larger, well‑designed randomised trials that use active placebos, maintain blinding, and follow participants for longer periods. Such studies will help us determine whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy truly benefits anxiety, depression, and existential distress, and will clarify any longer‑term harms.",
