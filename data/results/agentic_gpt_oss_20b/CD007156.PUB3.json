They may also increase how wide the mouth can open, but the gain is less than 10 mm – a change most people would not notice. Side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.  \n– Pentoxifylline, a medicine that improves blood flow, probably adds a very small increase in mouth opening (about 2 mm).  \n– For many other approaches – steroid injections into the mouth tissue, guided physiotherapy exercises, or other blood‑vessel‑widening drugs – the current studies do not the clear benefits, and information on harms is limited.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic condition that stiffens the lining of the mouth. It makes it hard to open the mouth, chew, speak and swallow. People with OSF often feel a painful burning sensation and have a lower quality of life. OSF also raises the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (the seed of the betel‑quid plant). Treatment usually starts by stopping this habit and then tries many other options – medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound or alternative therapies – but we do not know which are truly effective and safe.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe examined all randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to different treatments) that tested any intervention for OSF. We wanted to see whether the treatments help people eat, chew and speak normally, increase the distance between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is fully open (interincisal distance), lessen the burning sensation, improve overall wellbeing, and avoid harmful side‑effects.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?\nWe searched for trials that compared a drug, surgical procedure or other therapy for OSF with a placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (a system that grades how confident we are in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 trials involving 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The studies lasted less than three months, three to six months, or longer than six months. A wide range of interventions was tested, including oral antioxidants, pentoxifylline, other blood‑vessel‑widening drugs, steroid injections, hydrocortisone + hyaluronidase, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound and various alternative therapies. Most trials compared an active treatment with placebo or no active treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n– Antioxidant tablets probably reduce burning and may increase mouth opening by less than 10 mm.  \n– Pentoxifylline probably adds a small increase in mouth opening (about 2 mm).  \n– Evidence for steroid injections, other vasodilator drugs, hydrocortisone + hyaluronidase, or physiotherapy is very uncertain.  \n– Reported side‑effects were generally mild, such as stomach upset, nausea or abdominal pain. One study of an abdominal fat graft reported serious harms in 3 of 30 participants, leading to a longer hospital stay; such serious events were rare.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the results because many participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported. The overall number of studies is insufficient to be certain about the benefits and harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review with searches completed up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
