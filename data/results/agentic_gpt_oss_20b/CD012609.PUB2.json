  "text": "Is infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) helpful for keeping Crohn’s disease in remission?\n\n– Infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) probably helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission by reducing the chance of clinical relapse (return of disease symptoms) compared with placebo (inactive treatment). It works even better when we give it together with purine analogues (medicines that suppress the immune system).  \n– Infliximab appears to work similarly to a biosimilar infliximab (a copy of the original biologic medicine), but current studies do not give clear evidence about any differences in effectiveness or safety.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm how well infliximab prevents flares, to clarify its safety profile, and to compare it directly with other active treatments over longer periods.\n\nWhat is Crohn’s disease and why does it matter?  \nCrohn’s disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation – swelling and irritation – in the digestive tract. People may experience pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue, and the inflammation can lead to serious complications such as bowel damage or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease often flares up and can disrupt daily life, keeping it under control is a major draft.\n\nHow might infliximab help keep Crohn’s disease in remission?  \nInfliximab is a biologic drug known as a monoclonal antibody. It attaches to tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), a protein that drives inflammation and is found in high amounts in people with Crohn’s disease. By neutralising TNF‑α, infliximab reduces the inflammation that causes symptoms. We wanted to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has reached remission can stop the disease from flaring up again and whether the drug is safe for this purpose.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe set out to determine how effective and safe infliximab is for maintaining remission in people with Crohn’s disease. Specifically, we compared infliximab with placebo or other active treatments to see whether it reduces the chance of disease returning (clinical relapse) and to assess serious side‑effects or withdrawals from treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases up to June 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified nine trials that together enrolled 1,257 participants aged 18–69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received a biologic drug; two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve participants. At the start of the studies, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders who still had active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease. All studies allowed participants to take other medicines at the same time. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, mixed commercial‑public sources, or public bodies.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo, with about 19 fewer relapses per 100 people treated.  \n– When we give infliximab together with purine analogues, it probably prevents about 47 more relapses per 100 people than using purine analogues alone.  \n– Compared with a biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may cause about 7 more relapses per 100 people and may increase loss of clinical response (when the treatment stops working) by about 17 more people per 100.  \n– The original infliximab may also cause more withdrawals because of side‑effects than a biosimilar, but we are very uncertain whether serious adverse events differ between the two.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these findings. Most studies were small and often not blinded, so participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects research published until that date.",
