  "text": "How accurate are the head‑impulse, nystagmus, and test‑of‑skew (HINTS) exam for detecting brain‑related causes of sudden severe dizziness (acute vestibular syndrome)?\n\nKey messages\n- Trained clinicians in emergency departments can use the HINTS exam to spot brain‑related (central) causes of acute vestibular syndrome and to rule them out; we have limited confidence in this result because the evidence is small.\n- Adding video goggles (video‑assisted HINTS) or a hearing test (HINTS Plus) changes the test’s performance, but current studies give only modest confidence in these versions.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that compare different providers, settings, and video assistance, and that compare HINTS directly with MRI scanning.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why does it matter?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a sudden onset of severe dizziness. People with AVS may feel the room spin (vertigo), feel sick, vomit, have involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), or feel unsteady. AVS can arise from the inner ear (a peripheral cause) or from the brain (a central cause). Knowing the cause matters because treatment and the risk of serious outcomes, such as stroke, differ. Doctors usually consider risk factors, medical history, a physical exam, and sometimes an MRI scan of the brain to decide.\n\nWhat is the HINTS (and HINTS Plus) examination?\nThe HINTS exam is a quick bedside test that helps doctors decide whether AVS comes from the inner ear or the brain. HINTS stands for:\n- Head impulse – the doctor gently turns the patient’s head while watching the eyes; a normal eye response suggests a peripheral problem.\n- Nystagmus – the doctor looks at the direction of the involuntary eye movements; certain patterns point to a central cause.\n- Test of skew – the doctor checks whether the eyes are perfectly aligned; a misalignment can indicate a central problem.\nHINTS Plus adds a simple hearing test to the three steps. Some clinicians record the eye movements with video goggles (video‑assisted HINTS) to increase precision.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus exams identify central (brain‑related) causes of AVS. We looked for studies that used these tests in real‑world settings such as emergency departments or urgent‑care clinics and compared the test results with a final diagnosis made by MRI or expert neurologists. We also examined whether video recording altered test accuracy.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trial registers) up to September 2022. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and judged the certainty of the evidence. We included diagnostic‑accuracy studies that compared HINTS or HINTS Plus, with or without video assistance, against MRI or a neurologist’s final diagnosis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 16 studies with 2,024 participants (average age ≈ 60 years). Thirteen studies were done in emergency departments and about half of the examinations were performed by neurologists. All studies compared the bedside HINTS tests with MRI or a neurologist’s diagnosis.\n\nHow accurate is the test?\n- The clinical HINTS exam correctly identified about 94 % of people who truly had a central cause. Our confidence in this result is limited because the evidence is small and some studies had bias.\n- The clinical HINTS Plus exam identified about 95 % of central cases, also with limited confidence.\n- Video‑assisted HINTS showed a wide range of accuracy (85 %–100 % sensitivity) but the evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot tell if it improves identification.\n- Video‑assisted HINTS Plus probably identifies 85 %–94 % of central cases; we have moderate confidence in this estimate.\n- For the clinical tests, the ability to correctly rule out a brain‑related cause (specificity) was between 73 % and 87 %. The video‑assisted versions were less specific and the evidence is less certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings because some studies may have been biased, many were small, and not all reported the outcomes we needed. The evidence does not cover all settings, all types of providers, or all patient groups.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches captured studies published up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",
