  "text": "\"Is using ultrasound (sound imaging) better than feeling for landmarks to give spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults?\"\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Using ultrasound to see the spine reduces the number of needle sticks we need. It also shortens the procedure time and probably raises the chance of getting the needle right on the first try.  \n- We did not see more harmful side‑effects when we used ultrasound, and the evidence for these procedural benefits is strong.  \n- The certainty of the evidence is low for patient satisfaction, technical failure (when the block does not work and must be redone), pain during the procedure, and rare adverse events. More research is needed.\n\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia – the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord – is a common way to numb the lower body for surgery or childbirth. Doctors usually locate the injection spot by feeling the patient’s back (using anatomical landmarks). The spot they feel may not match the actual position inside the spine, leading to several needle insertions. Each extra attempt can raise the risk of bleeding, infection, discomfort, and lower patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about using ultrasound for neuraxial anaesthesia?\nWe wanted to compare two approaches: using an ultrasound machine to visualise the spine before or during the injection versus the traditional method of feeling the back’s landmarks. We examined whether ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the time needed? Actually: shortens the time needed for the procedure, and improves how patients feel about the experience. We also looked at first‑attempt success, technical failures, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries and reference lists for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years). We updated the search in November 2023. Two reviewers extracted data and we used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 65 trials that enrolled 6,823 adults from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania. About half (3,149) were obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the rest were non‑obstetric surgical patients.\n\nThe meta‑analyses show that ultrasound guidance reduces the average number of needle attempts by about 0.4. It also shortens the needling time by roughly 34 seconds. The evidence for these procedural benefits is high certainty. Ultrasound also likely increases the proportion of blocks that succeed on the first attempt, with moderate certainty.\n\nPatient satisfaction and technical failure appear to change little with ultrasound, but the certainty of these findings is low. We are very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure. We are also uncertain about rare adverse events because few low‑quality studies examined these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small and participants and clinicians knew which technique was used, which could bias the results. Outcomes with low certainty rely on few studies of limited quality, so we have limited confidence in those findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023, the date of our most recent search.\n\nOverall, using ultrasound can make spinal or epidural anaesthesia quicker and require fewer needle sticks, without a clear increase in side‑effects. More research is needed on pain, patient satisfaction and rare complications.",
