Around 84 million people are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, persecution or other emergencies. Most live in low‑ and middle‑income countries where health services are limited. In these stressful settings people experience fear, loss, insecurity and other threats to their mental‑well‑being (overall emotional health). While many studies look at treating mental illness, we focused on ways to promote good mental health – feeling hopeful, coping well, having a good quality of life, and being able to function socially.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how are they used? Psychosocial interventions combine psychological support (talking about feelings or learning coping skills) with social activities (group games, community projects or peer support). They are usually delivered in groups by paraprofessionals – people who are not formally trained mental‑health professionals but have received basic training to help others at the first point of contact. The aim is to boost mental‑well‑being, resilience and everyday functioning without treating a diagnosed mental disorder.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out? We wanted to know whether group‑based psychosocial programmes improve positive aspects of mental health compared with doing nothing, receiving usual care, or waiting for help. We looked at outcomes such as mental‑well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and pro‑social behaviour in children, adolescents and adults living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we do? We searched eight databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial promotion programmes with no intervention or usual care. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find? We identified 13 trials involving 7 917 participants. Nine trials studied children or adolescents and four studied adults. The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal and Tanzania. All participants did not have a diagnosed mental disorder. Paraprofessionals ran the group programmes, which lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\n\nFor children and adolescents, the programmes had little or no effect on mental‑well‑being or pro‑social behaviour. The certainty of this evidence is very low, and we could not determine whether the programmes changed functioning in this age group.\n\nFor adults, the programmes gave a small boost to mental‑well‑being at the end of the study, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know if any benefit lasts after follow‑up. No trials measured functioning or pro‑social behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? We have low confidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered, and the trials were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence? We completed our searches in January 2023, so the evidence is up to date.",
