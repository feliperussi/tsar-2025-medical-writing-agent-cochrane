High blood sugar can make these vessels leak, swell, or close, leading to blurry vision, loss of sight, and in severe cases, blindness. It is one of the most common eye complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide.\n\nHow might blood pressure control influence eye health in people with diabetes?\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) adds extra stress to the already vulnerable retinal vessels, potentially speeding up the development and worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Lowering blood pressure could therefore reduce the chance of new eye damage (incidence) or slow the worsening of existing damage (progression). However, studies have shown mixed results, and it is unclear whether tighter blood‑pressure targets help everyone with diabetes or only those who already have hypertension.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to gather all randomised trials that compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care, or placebo in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We wanted to know whether tighter control reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, slows its progression, preserves visual sharpness (visual sharpness), and what side‑effects, quality‑of‑life impacts, or costs might occur.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases and trial registries up to 3 September 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results for incidence, progression and related outcomes and judged confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 randomised trials that together enrolled 27 185 people with diabetes (4 620 with type 1 and 22 565 with type 2). The studies lasted from less than a year to nine years and were conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Participants included both people with normal blood pressure and those with hypertension. The intensive approach used antihypertensive drugs, tighter blood‑pressure targets or different drug classes, compared with a less intensive or usual‑care approach. Funding sources varied, with some trials fully or partially supported by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWhat were the main results, including mortality?\nIntensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease by about 5 fewer and 5 fewer people per 100 over five years. It may also lower the combined risk of new or worsening eye disease by about 6 fewer people per 100, but the evidence is uncertain. The treatment makes little or no difference to how existing eye disease gets worse, and it does not clearly reduce serious complications such as proliferative retinopathy, macular swelling or vitreous bleeding. The effect on visual sharpness remains unclear. Intensive control may reduce the risk of death by about 2 fewer deaths per 100 people, but this finding is not definitive. It probably increases episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension) by about 2 more cases per 100 people.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because the trials involved different types of participants, used varied treatment methods, and many were small. For several outcomes there were few studies, so we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe summarised evidence that is current to September 2021.",
