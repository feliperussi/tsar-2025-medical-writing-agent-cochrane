They improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after about one year.  \n– Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably reduce pain two years after surgery, lower the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion, and probably reduce urinary retention after surgery. Quality of life may be slightly lower, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Longer‑term, high‑quality research is needed to clarify safety, repeat‑surgery rates and quality‑of‑life effects.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?  \nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure rises in the bladder, for example during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting heavy objects. The leakage can be embarrassing and affect daily activities. Most women first try pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes or a pessary (a small device that supports the bladder). When these measures do not help enough, doctors may offer surgery that adds support to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The goal is less pain, quicker recovery and fewer complications. Many countries restrict synthetic mesh because it can become exposed, erode into surrounding tissue, or cause painful sex (dyspareunia).\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out?  \nWe asked three questions: (1) How well do single‑incision slings stop or reduce leakage compared with retropubic slings, transobturator slings or autologous fascial slings (made from the patient’s own tissue)? (2) What short‑ and long‑term side‑effects occur, such as pain, mesh problems, urinary retention or the need for further surgery? (3) Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other options?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE and trial registers) up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. Two reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and combined results using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 trials involving 8 051 women. All trials compared a single‑incision sling with either an autologous fascial sling (1 trial), a retropubic sling (10 trials) or a transobturator sling (51 trials). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013; we reported these separately and excluded them from the main analysis.\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference in the chance of being cured or improved at one year. They probably reduced pain two years after surgery. They also lowered the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion, and probably reduced urinary retention after surgery. Quality of life may be slightly lower at twelve months, and evidence on painful intercourse remains uncertain.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also made little or no difference in the chance of cure or improvement at one year. Evidence on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery or mesh revision was uncertain.\n\nOnly one small trial compared single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings, providing insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, participants and clinicians often knew which surgery was performed, and study methods varied. These factors reduce our confidence in the results and limit how broadly we can apply them.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",
