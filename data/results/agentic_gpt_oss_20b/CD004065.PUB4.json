The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can damage the lining of the esophagus when it builds up. People with EoE often have trouble swallowing, feel food stuck, experience chest pain that feels like heartburn, and may vomit. Repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and reducing quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must continue for years.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about medical treatment for EoE?  \nWe wanted to know whether medicines, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill), can:  \n– improve swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life,  \n– reduce the number of eosinophils seen in esophageal tissue (histology),  \n– produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopy (a camera view), and  \n– be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that make patients stop treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP databases up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for EoE with placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n\nWe included 41 randomised controlled trials with 3 253 participants. Fourteen trials compared corticosteroids with placebo and nine trials compared biologic drugs with placebo.\n\nCorticosteroids  \n– About 20 % more people improved their swallowing symptoms when they took steroids.  \n– Roughly 64 % more people achieved a low eosinophil count in the tissue, showing a clear reduction in inflammation.  \n– Slightly fewer people stopped treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– We are not sure whether steroids improve what doctors see when they look inside the esophagus with a camera.\n\nBiologic drugs  \n– About 55 % more people achieved a low eosinophil count, indicating a strong reduction in tissue inflammation.  \n– The drugs show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms.  \n– They do not appear to change the rate at which people stop treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– We are not sure whether biologics improve the camera view of the esophagus.\n\nOverall, the evidence for both drug classes on endoscopic healing and on long‑term outcomes is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany findings have low confidence because some studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the trials varied in how the medicines were given and in the types of patients studied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence is current to March 2023.",
