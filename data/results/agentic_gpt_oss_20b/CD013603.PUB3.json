  "text": "What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers describe both benefits and challenges of combining services. They see more coordinated care and better meeting of patient needs, but also report higher workload, unclear roles, and a need for extra training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– The studies we found come from 37 countries and mostly use one‑off interviews or focus‑group discussions. Only a few studies used longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods, so our picture of workers’ experiences is fragmented.\n– Because the evidence is diverse and often shallow, we recommend future research that follows workers over time, uses clear conceptual frameworks, and includes under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes (for example, separate programmes for HIV, maternal health, or tuberculosis). This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering them together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted key information from each study, counted how often different features appeared, and assessed of the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. These studies came from 37 countries, with a roughly equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries, respectively. Most studies used one‑off interviews or focus‑group discussions (cross‑sectional designs). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies or ethnography. We identified six broad service streams that were integrated:\n– mental and behavioural health\n– HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual‑reproductive health\n– maternal, women’s, and child health\n– non‑communicable diseases\n– general primary‑care services\n– allied or specialised services\nThese interventions were described as either full or partial integration. We also mapped three integration strategies: horizontal integration (bringing services together at the same level), service expansion (adding new services to existing ones), and service linkage (connecting separate services). A wide range of health‑worker cadres participated, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers, and support staff and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of individual participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Overall, the evidence does not allow us to say whether integration improves health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because the studies involve different types of workers, use varied integration approaches, and often involve small sample sizes. The evidence does not cover all relevant people or settings, and the methodological diversity makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence we included is up to date with searches completed in July 2020.",
