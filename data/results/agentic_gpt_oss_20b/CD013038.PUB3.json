  "text": "Does letting early‑born babies (preterm infants) smell and taste milk during tube feeding help them start normal feeding sooner?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding (a tube that bypasses the mouth) does not speed up the time they start sucking feeds, and no harmful effects were reported. The evidence for this outcome is very uncertain (very low‑certainty).\n– The same approach makes little or no difference to how long babies need intravenous nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), how quickly they reach full enteral feeds (the point when all nutrition is given through the tube), or the risk of serious gut problems (necrotising enterocolitis) or later infections. Certainty is low for intravenous nutrition, very low for full enteral feeds, and moderate for late infection.\n– Existing studies were small and had methodological problems. Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether this low‑cost intervention can benefit any group of preterm infants.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing well enough to feed from a bottle or breast. Because of this, they receive nutrition through an orogastric or nasogastric tube that goes into the stomach. Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not smell or taste the milk. Without that sensory exposure, the development of normal feeding skills may be slower, tube feeding may last longer, and hospital stays can be extended.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the same time as their tube feeds helps them move more quickly to full oral (sucking) feeds. We also checked whether this simple, low‑cost intervention caused any harm, such as increasing the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or infections.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos) and trial registers up to 26 April 2023. Two reviewers independently selected randomised or quasi‑randomised studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined results with standard meta‑analysis methods and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nEight trials involving 1 277 preterm infants met our criteria. The pooled result suggests a very uncertain effect on the time to reach full sucking feeds (mean difference –1.07 days, 95 % CI –2.63 to 0.50; very low‑certainty). The intervention probably makes little or no difference to the duration of intravenous nutrition (mean difference 0.23 days, 95 % CI –0.24 to 0.71; low‑certainty), to the time to reach full enteral feeds (mean difference –0.16 days, 95 % CI –0.45 to 0.12; very low‑certainty), and to the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (risk ratio 0.93, 95 % CI 0.47 to 1.84; low‑certainty). Moderate‑certainty evidence indicates it probably does not change the risk of late infection (risk ratio 1.14, 95 % CI 0.74 to 1.75). No clear safety concerns emerged.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, some participants and staff knew which group they were in, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. Methods of delivering the smell or taste varied, making it hard to compare results. These issues reduce our confidence in the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised was current to the end of April 2023. New studies published after that date may affect these conclusions.",
