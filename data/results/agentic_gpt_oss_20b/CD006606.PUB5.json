PCOS is a hormonal condition that affects about 8 %–13 % of women of child‑bearing age. It often causes irregular periods, higher levels of male‑type hormones, and many small cysts on the ovaries. These changes can stop an egg from maturing and being released, leading to infertility – the inability to get pregnant after a year of regular, unprotected sex. About half of all women who seek help for infertility have PCOS.\n\nWhat are the usual assisted‑reproduction techniques for women with PCOS, and what problems can they cause? When natural conception is unlikely, doctors use assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF (in‑vitro fertilisation) or ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection). In IVF, eggs are collected, fertilised with sperm in the lab, and the embryos are placed back into the uterus. ICSI is a variation where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. To collect enough eggs, women with PCOS often receive high‑dose medicines that stimulate the ovaries (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, COH). This can lead to an over‑response: many immature eggs are retrieved, egg quality can be uneven, and the risk of OHSS increases.\n\nWhat is in‑vitro maturation (IVM) and how might it help women with PCOS? IVM is a technique where immature eggs are collected earlier – before they fully develop in the body – and then allowed to mature in the laboratory. After maturation, the eggs can be fertilised using IVF or ICSI. By retrieving eggs earlier, IVM aims to reduce the need for high‑dose stimulation medicines and therefore lower the risk of OHSS while still giving women a chance at pregnancy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We set out to compare IVM (followed by IVF or ICSI) with the standard IVF/ICSI approach in women with PCOS. Specifically, we wanted to know whether IVM improves or harms important outcomes such as live‑birth rates, miscarriage rates, clinical‑pregnancy rates, the occurrence of OHSS, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, OpenGrey and relevant guidelines up to 27 February 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that compared IVM with conventional IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results with a random‑effects model and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find? We identified four trials that together enrolled 810 women with PCOS. The evidence on live birth is very uncertain. If 46 out of 100 women have a baby with IVF, IVM might give between 13 and 53 babies per 100 women. High‑certainty evidence shows that IVM increases miscarriage per clinical pregnancy – about 20 % with IVF versus 20 %–40 % with IVM. High‑certainty evidence also shows that IVM greatly reduces moderate or severe OHSS – about 3.5 % with IVF versus 0 %–2.4 % with IVM. The limited data suggest little or no difference in preterm birth and congenital anomalies, but the numbers are small.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? Many trials had a high risk of bias because they lacked blinding, had incomplete reporting, and involved small sample sizes with few events. Results varied across studies, and some important outcomes (such as cycle cancellation or oocyte fertilisation) were not reported. These issues make it hard to draw reliable conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence? This review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes all studies published up to February 2023. The evidence reflects the most recent data available, but further high‑quality trials are needed.",
