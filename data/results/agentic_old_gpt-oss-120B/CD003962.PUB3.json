  "text": "Title: Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, diet changes, or tonsil removal) effective for IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages  \n- We found that blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that helps control blood pressure and fluid balance) probably lower proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and improve kidney function (how well the kidneys clean the blood) without clear serious side‑effects, but we are uncertain whether they prevent kidney failure or death.  \n- Other non‑immune‑suppressing approaches such as tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils), fish‑oil supplements, anticoagulants (blood thinners), or traditional Chinese medicines show limited or inconsistent benefits; the studies are small, often from a single ethnic group, and of uncertain quality.  \n- Because most trials are short, small, and have methodological limitations, we need larger, well‑designed studies that follow patients longer and include diverse populations.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease where an antibody called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the tiny filtering units of the kidneys (the glomeruli). This buildup can damage the filters, letting blood and protein leak into the urine. About one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five people with IgAN develop kidney failure (the kidneys can no longer clean the blood) within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so many people feel fine for years while hidden damage accumulates.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well treatments that do **not** suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive therapy lowers the activity of the body’s immune system) work for people with IgAN. Specifically we asked: (1) do these treatments reduce proteinuria and protect kidney function, and (2) do they cause important harms or side‑effects? We compared each treatment with placebo, no treatment, or standard care (the usual medical treatment).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central and trial registries without language or date limits. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts independently. From each eligible study we extracted participant details, interventions, comparators, outcomes (proteinuria, eGFR, renal events) and follow‑up length. When at least two trials reported the same outcome we combined results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and measured heterogeneity with the I² statistic. We rated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach (a system for rating confidence in research results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 80 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that enrolled 4 856 people with biopsy‑proven (confirmed by tissue sample) IgAN, including adults and children. The trials tested blood‑pressure‑lowering drugs (mainly ACE inhibitors or ARBs, both antihypertensive agents that block the renin‑angiotensin system), tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs. Most trials were small, short, and many did not report death or progression to kidney failure.\n\nWe found that the most reliable evidence was for the blood‑pressure‑lowering drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system. Compared with placebo or usual care, these drugs probably reduce the amount of protein that leaks into the urine and probably lower serum creatinine (a blood test that measures waste removal by the kidneys) while modestly improving kidney function. The certainty of evidence is moderate. We cannot tell whether these drugs change the risk of progressing to kidney failure, and they probably do not increase adverse events (unwanted harmful events). Evidence for tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil, traditional medicines and antimalarial drugs was low‑certainty and showed uncertain or small benefits.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe have little confidence in many findings because participants often knew which treatment they received, studies were very small, and not all reported the outcomes we needed. The evidence does not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all studies published up to December 2023.",
