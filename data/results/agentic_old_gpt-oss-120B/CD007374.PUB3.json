  "text": "Do structured education programmes (teaching sessions) improve blood‑sugar control and health outcomes for people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where kidneys are damaged slowly and cannot filter waste well) and diabetes (a disease where the body cannot control blood sugar)?\n\nKey messages  \n- Education programmes probably lower blood‑sugar levels, measured by HbA1c (a blood test that shows average blood sugar over the past 2‑3 months), and may reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol; they also increase diabetes knowledge and self‑efficacy (belief in one’s ability to manage the condition). No harmful effects were reported.  \n- When education is added to already intensive multidisciplinary (team‑based) coordinated care, we found little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney function (eGFR – an estimate of how well the kidneys filter waste), blood pressure, or cholesterol, and very little information on serious outcomes such as death, severe low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) or kidney failure.  \n- The evidence comes from few, small, low‑quality studies. Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm benefits and detect any harms over longer follow‑up periods.\n\nWhy are chronic kidney disease and diabetes a problem for many people?  \nMany adults live with both conditions. CKD reduces the kidneys’ ability to remove waste and extra water. Diabetes makes it hard to keep blood sugar in the target range. Together they require complex daily routines – medicines, blood‑sugar checks, diet control and sometimes dialysis (a machine that filters blood when kidneys fail). Sticking to these routines (adherence) is often difficult, leading to high blood sugar and worsening kidney damage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see whether education programmes – sessions where health professionals give information, advice and counselling – help people with CKD and diabetes manage their health. Specifically, we examined effects on blood‑sugar control (HbA1c), cholesterol, diabetes knowledge, self‑efficacy and any possible harms. We compared participants who received an education programme with those who received usual care alone.\n\nHow did we find the studies?  \nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register, ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) for trials that evaluated education programmes for adults with CKD and diabetes. We screened titles, abstracts and full texts, and extracted data on study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. We assessed confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach (a system that rates how much we can trust the results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised trials enrolling 840 adults with CKD and diabetes. All trials delivered education – spoken, written, audio‑recorded or computer‑based – by nurses, pharmacists, educators or other health professionals. The programmes were compared with routine care alone or with routine care plus multidisciplinary coordinated care. Participants ranged from people on dialysis to those with early kidney damage. Follow‑up lasted from a few weeks to about 18 months. No trial reported data on kidney‑function measures, mortality, quality of life or adverse events.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n- Four trials (467 participants) showed an average HbA1c reduction of about 0.4 % (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n- Small reductions in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reported, but the evidence is of low certainty.  \n- Single small studies suggested improvements in diabetes knowledge, self‑efficacy and short‑term diet or monitoring behaviours; these findings are of low or very low certainty.  \n- We found no clear evidence of effects on death, severe hypoglycaemia, kidney failure or eGFR (very low certainty).  \n- When education was added to multidisciplinary coordinated care, low‑certainty evidence indicated little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, eGFR, blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia or cholesterol.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because participants knew which group they were in (lack of blinding) and because the studies were very small. The limited number of trials also restricts our ability to detect rare harms.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies published up to July 2024.",
