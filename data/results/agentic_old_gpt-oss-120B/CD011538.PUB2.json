Examples include cancer, asthma, diabetes, and attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Up to almost half of young people have such a condition, and about 5 % have a severe form that limits everyday activities. When a child misses school because of illness, they can fall behind in lessons, miss friendships, and feel less connected to school. This loss of school engagement (the degree to which a student is involved in school activities, attends classes regularly, participates in learning, and feels connected to teachers and peers) and lower academic achievement (grades or test scores) may affect future education, work prospects, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nWhat are education support services and why might they help?\nEducation support services are programmes or resources that help children and teens stay in school and learn effectively despite a chronic health condition (for example tutoring, home‑based lessons, classroom aides, or coordinated plans for returning to school after a hospital stay). The idea is that extra academic help and smoother transitions back to school keep children engaged and maintain their learning progress.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?\nWe set out to (1) describe what kinds of education support programmes have been tried for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, and (2) examine whether these programmes improve school engagement and academic achievement. We also looked for any effects on returning to school and on mental health (self‑esteem, a person’s overall sense of self‑worth).\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\n- Search strategy: We searched multiple health, social‑science, and education databases for studies that included children or adolescents with chronic health conditions and evaluated education support on school engagement or academic achievement.\n- Data extraction: We recorded the direction of effects for school engagement and academic achievement outcomes from each eligible study.\n- Risk‑of‑bias and confidence assessment: We assessed study quality and applied GRADE criteria (a systematic approach to rate how confident we can be in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four small randomised trials that enrolled 359 children and adolescents (aged 4‑18 years) with chronic health conditions – three studies involved children with cancer and one involved children with ADHD. All trials tested some form of education support, but the exact type, duration, and setting were not described in the abstracts.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain:\n- School engagement – three of the four studies suggested that education support helped children stay involved in school, but the studies were few and of low quality, so we cannot be sure the support really improves engagement.\n- Academic achievement – the results were mixed. One study showed a possible benefit, while another suggested a worsening of grades or test scores. We do not know whether the support changes academic performance.\n- Returning to school after illness – a single small study (30 participants) found a modest improvement in how quickly children got back to school when support was provided, but confidence in this result is very low.\n- Mental health (self‑esteem) – two studies measured self‑esteem and both reported a slight increase when support was given, suggesting the support may modestly boost self‑esteem, although the evidence remains limited.\n\nOverall, research on education support for young people with chronic health conditions is in its early stages. More robust studies are needed to determine whether such support truly benefits school involvement, learning outcomes, and wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants likely knew which group they were in, the studies were very small, they did not report all outcomes we wanted, and they used different types of participants and delivery methods. These factors increase the risk of bias and reduce certainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2021 of search.",
