They also raise the chance of unwanted side effects such as irregular bleeding (unexpected spotting between periods), headaches and nausea; the evidence for these effects is of moderate reliability.  \n- We do not have enough reliable evidence to say whether combined oral contraceptive pills work better or worse than pain‑relieving medicines (non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen). The single study that compared them was small, and the data are uncertain. Using the pills continuously (without the usual hormone‑free break) may give a little more pain relief than the standard monthly schedule, but the evidence is limited.  \n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that compare combined oral contraceptive pills with NSAIDs, test different dosing schedules, and monitor long‑term safety and serious side effects.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?  \nPrimary dysmenorrhoea is painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, school, work and overall quality of life. Because it is very common, it is a major source of pain and missed days for many women.\n\nHow are combined oral contraceptive pills used to treat painful periods?  \nCombined oral contraceptive pills contain two hormones – estrogen and progestogen – that stop ovulation and thin the lining of the uterus. This reduces the intensity of menstrual cramps. Doctors sometimes prescribe these pills specifically for primary dysmenorrhoea, either as a regular monthly regimen (a planned schedule for taking medication) or as a continuous regimen with no hormone‑free break. The most common alternative treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, which lower pain and inflammation.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know how well combined oral contraceptive pills relieve primary dysmenorrhoea and what side‑effects they cause. We compared the pills to placebo, to other pill types or doses, and to NSAIDs. We looked at pain relief, improvement rates and any adverse events (unwanted problems caused by the treatment).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pills or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. Two reviewers independently extracted data on pain scores, side‑​effects and study details. We pooled the results using meta‑analysis (a statistical method that combines findings from several studies). We assessed confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach (a system that rates how much we can trust the results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 21 trials that enrolled a total of 3,723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea, confirmed by clinical examination or ultrasound (an imaging test that uses sound waves). The trials compared combined oral contraceptive pills with no treatment or placebo, with other pill regimens (different estrogen doses, newer‑generation pills, continuous versus standard cyclic schedules) and with NSAIDs. The studies were small and varied in participants, settings and methods, and they did not report long‑term safety.\n\nMain results  \n- Combined oral contraceptive pills reduced menstrual pain compared with no treatment. The evidence that they increase the proportion of women who experience pain relief is uncertain.  \n- The pills probably cause a slight increase in overall side‑effects and definitely cause a large increase in irregular bleeding. They probably raise the chance of headaches and nausea a little, and we do not know whether they affect weight.  \n- The pills may reduce the need for extra pain medication and the number of days missed from work, but the evidence for these benefits is uncertain.  \n- Taking the pills continuously (without the usual break) may reduce pain more than the standard monthly schedule, although the evidence is limited.  \n- Changing the estrogen dose or using newer‑generation pills probably makes little or no difference to pain relief.  \n- The standard cyclic regimen probably increases irregular bleeding a little compared with continuous use and may raise the chance of side‑effects slightly.  \n- We are unsure whether combined oral contraceptive pills work better than NSAIDs because the data are insufficient.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. Many studies were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received. The trials used different pill types and schedules, and they did not examine long‑term safety or all groups of women.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
