These conditions are grouped under chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). CSLD includes bronchiectasis – where the airways become widened and scarred, making it hard to clear mucus – and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB – a persistent bacterial infection of the airways). When mucus is not cleared, bacteria grow and cause repeated flare‑ups (exacerbations). Flare‑ups make children feel sick, miss school, and can damage the lungs over time. Current treatment focuses on antibiotics, chest physiotherapy (special breathing techniques to move mucus), and sometimes inhaled medicines, but families and clinicians are looking for additional ways to keep airways clear.\n\nHow might mucus‑thinning medicines help?\nMucolytics are medicines that thin or break down thick mucus so it can be coughed out more easily. The most studied mucolytic for children is 3 % hypertonic saline, a salty water mist inhaled before chest physiotherapy. By improving mucociliary clearance (the natural movement of mucus out of the lungs), mucolytics could interrupt the cycle of mucus build‑up, infection, and inflammation (the body’s response that can cause swelling and redness). We do not yet know how well these medicines work in children with CSLD, whether they reduce flare‑ups, improve lung function, or cause any harms.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked three questions:\n1. Do mucolytic medicines reduce the number of respiratory flare‑ups in children with CSLD (including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis)?\n2. Do they improve lung function, measured by simple breathing tests such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)?\n3. Are there any harms or side‑effects (adverse events) associated with these medicines?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched major databases and trial registries for randomised trials that compared a mucolytic with a placebo or no treatment in children with CSLD. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and resolved disagreements by discussion or a third reviewer. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE (high, moderate, low, or very low).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified only one eligible study. It was a small cross‑over trial that enrolled 63 children with non‑cystic‑fibrosis bronchiectasis; complete data were available for 52 participants (26 in each treatment period). The children were about 9–10 years old, and 40 % were boys. The trial compared nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline given before chest physiotherapy with chest physiotherapy alone; each period lasted eight weeks. No other trials of mucolytics (including oral forms), no studies in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis, and no studies reporting quality‑of‑life outcomes were found.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nBecause the evidence comes from a single, very small study, we are uncertain about the effects. The study reported that children receiving hypertonic saline had about three fewer flare‑ups per year than when they received physiotherapy alone, but the certainty of this finding is very low. The study also suggested modest improvements in lung function (FEV1 and FVC), yet this evidence is also very uncertain. No adverse events were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe cannot be confident in the results. Participants may have known which treatment they received, introducing bias. The study was small and did not report all outcomes we were interested in, such as quality of life. The evidence does not cover all types of CSLD, all mucolytic medicines, or use during an acute flare‑up.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nOur search was up to date to September 2024.",
