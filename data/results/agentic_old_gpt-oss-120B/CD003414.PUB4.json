The studies did not show clear differences and reported no major safety problems.  \n- Trials compared natural cycles with hormone‑therapy cycles (with or without GnRHa, a drug that blocks the body’s own hormone signals) and also compared modified natural cycles (a natural cycle plus a small hCG trigger, a hormone that starts ovulation) with hormone‑therapy cycles. All comparisons showed little or no advantage for any method, and the evidence is limited.  \n- Most trials were small, did not report all outcomes, and gave imprecise results. Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to determine which preparation method works best and to identify any possible harms.\n\nWhat health problem does this review address?  \nMany couples struggle to become pregnant and turn to assisted reproductive technologies such as in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF). After IVF creates embryos, they can be frozen and later placed back into the womb in a step called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET can increase the chance of a successful pregnancy and lower costs, but the uterine lining (endometrium) must be prepared carefully. If the lining is not ready, the embryo may not implant, leading to a failed cycle and emotional and financial strain.\n\nHow are uterine linings prepared for a frozen‑thawed embryo transfer?  \nWe identified three main approaches:  \n- **Natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycle** – we let the woman’s body follow its own monthly rhythm and time the transfer to her natural ovulation.  \n- **Hormone‑therapy (HT) cycle** – we give estrogen and progesterone pills or patches to build up the lining artificially.  \n- **Ovulation‑induction cycle** – we use medicines to trigger ovulation, often together with hormone therapy.  \nSometimes hormone therapy is combined with GnRHa (a substance that temporarily shuts down the body’s own hormone signals) to improve timing.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe set out to compare the safety and effectiveness of these preparation methods. Specifically, we asked which method – natural cycle, hormone‑therapy cycle (with or without GnRHa), or ovulation‑induction cycle – leads to higher chances of a live birth and lower chances of miscarriage, and how the sub‑types of each regimen compare.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that compared the three preparation methods for frozen embryo transfer. We combined the results to assess live‑birth and miscarriage outcomes and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 32 randomised trials involving 6,352 women undergoing frozen‑thawed embryo transfer. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The trials compared natural cycles, modified natural cycles that use an hCG trigger, hormone‑therapy cycles (with or without GnRHa), and ovulation‑induction cycles.  \n\nAcross the head‑to‑head comparisons the evidence suggests:  \n- Natural cycles probably make little or no difference to the chance of a live birth or having twins when compared with hormone‑therapy cycles (with or without GnRHa). The evidence is moderate‑certainty for live birth and low‑certainty for twins.  \n- Natural cycles versus modified natural cycles with an hCG trigger probably make little or no difference to ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage rates (moderate certainty). Effects on live birth and twins remain uncertain (low certainty).  \n- Modified natural cycles compared with standard hormone‑therapy cycles probably make little or no difference to live birth, ongoing pregnancy and twin rates (low certainty) and very low‑certainty evidence for miscarriage.  \n- Adding GnRHa to hormone‑therapy cycles probably makes little or no difference to live birth (moderate certainty) and low‑certainty evidence for miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy and twins.  \n\nThe review also compared ovulation‑induction cycles with the other methods, but only a few small trials were available. Those limited data also showed little or no clear advantage for ovulation‑induction cycles.\n\nBecause most evidence is of low or very low certainty and confidence intervals are wide, we cannot be sure that any one regimen is more effective or safer than another for women undergoing frozen embryo transfer.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings because many participants may have known which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and some outcomes had few events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies published up to December 2022.",
