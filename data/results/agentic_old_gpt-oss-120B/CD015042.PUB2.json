No medicines were tested and no unwanted harms (adverse events) were reported.  \n- The counselling did not clearly lower the amount of alcohol women drank, and it did not change how many women stayed in the programme. The evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain because the studies were few, small and varied.  \n- More well‑designed research is needed, especially trials that test medicines, assess safety, use consistent ways of measuring drinking and follow women for longer periods.  \n\nWhat is the problem with drinking alcohol during pregnancy?  \nWe know that alcohol can harm a developing baby. About 1 in 10 pregnant women worldwide, and up to 1 in 4 in some European countries, report drinking while pregnant. Alcohol can cause low birth weight, developmental delays and lifelong disabilities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Stopping or cutting back is often hard, especially for women who have alcohol use disorder (a medical condition where drinking causes health or social problems and is hard to stop).  \n\nHow do we usually try to help pregnant women stop drinking?  \nHealth professionals often use psychosocial interventions (short programmes that aim to change thoughts, feelings and social behaviour related to alcohol). These can be a single 10‑minute talk or a few short sessions over weeks. In other health areas, medicines sometimes treat alcohol dependence, but no medication has been tested for safety or effectiveness in pregnant women.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find?  \nWe asked two questions: (1) Do brief psychosocial support programmes help pregnant women stop drinking or reduce how much they drink? (2) Are any medicines safe and effective for treating alcohol dependence during pregnancy? We looked for randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to a new treatment or a comparison) that compared these interventions with usual care or no special treatment. We focused on outcomes such as continuous abstinence (not drinking at all over a defined period), reduction in drinks per drinking day, staying in treatment and any adverse events.  \n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases (for example PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) up to 8 January 2024. Two reviewers extracted data on study design, participants, outcomes and effect estimates. Where possible we combined results using meta‑analysis (a statistical technique that pools data from several studies). We rated the certainty of each outcome with the GRADE system (a method that judges how sure we are about the evidence) by considering risk of bias (chance results are distorted), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision (uncertainty because of few participants or wide confidence interval) and publication bias.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight randomised controlled trials involving 1,369 pregnant women. All trials evaluated brief psychosocial interventions; no trial tested a medication. Compared with usual care, brief psychosocial counselling may increase continuous abstinence (risk ratio 1.34, 95 % confidence interval 1.14‑1.57). This is low certainty evidence (we are not very confident in the result). The counselling had little or no effect on the number of drinks per drinking day (mean difference ‑0.42, 95 % confidence interval ‑1.13 to 0.28), which is very low certainty evidence (we have little confidence). Treatment completion was similar to usual care (risk ratio 0.98, 95 % confidence interval 0.94‑1.02 – the range where the true result is likely to fall), rated as moderate certainty evidence (we are fairly confident). No study reported adverse events.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence because participants and providers often knew which group they were in, and the studies were small and varied. This may have introduced bias and imprecision.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence includes all studies published up to January 2024.",
