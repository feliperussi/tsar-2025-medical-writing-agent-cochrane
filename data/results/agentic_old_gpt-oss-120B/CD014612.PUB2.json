  "text": "Does closing the small gaps (mesenteric defects – openings in the thin tissue that holds the intestines in place) during weight‑loss stomach surgery (Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass – a procedure that creates a small stomach pouch and reroutes part of the small intestine) reduce the risk of internal hernia (a condition where a loop of intestine slips through a hole inside the abdomen)?\n\nKey messages  \n- Closing the mesenteric defects may lower the chance of an internal hernia with bowel obstruction (a blockage that stops food and fluid moving through the intestine) in the years after surgery. The studies we found did not show‑clear extra short‑term problems such as postoperative (after surgery) complications or death, but the data are limited.  \n- The same studies showed little or no difference in overall complications within the first month, in early postoperative mortality (death shortly after surgery), or in intra‑operative (during the operation) complications. The certainty of these findings is low because only three small trials were available.  \n- Because the evidence comes from few trials with limited follow‑up, we need larger, well‑designed studies to confirm whether closure truly prevents internal hernias and to clarify any longer‑term harms such as a slightly longer hospital stay.\n\nWhat health problem can occur after a gastric bypass operation?  \nPeople who have severe obesity and undergo Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass can develop an internal hernia. This happens when a loop of intestine slips through a gap created by the surgery, potentially leading to bowel obstruction.\n\nWhy might surgeons close these openings, and what are the concerns?  \nSurgeons can stitch the mesenteric defects closed using non‑absorbable sutures (stitches that do not dissolve in the body). Closing the gaps might stop the intestine from slipping, but it could also create a kink or tension at the intestinal connection, which might cause a small bowel obstruction. Because evidence is limited, doctors and patients are uncertain about the best practice.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe compared closing the mesenteric defects with leaving them open after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. We looked to see whether closure reduces the chance of internal hernia with bowel obstruction up to ten years after surgery and whether it changes rates of other complications, death, length of hospital stay, and post‑surgery pain.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases for randomised controlled trials that compared closure versus non‑closure of mesenteric defects after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass in adults with obesity. Trials were eligible if they randomly assigned participants to a closure group or a non‑closure group and reported relevant outcomes. Two reviewers extracted data and pooled results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane tool and rated certainty with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three randomised controlled trials involving 3,010 adults with a body‑mass index of ≥ 35 kg/m² who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. The trials compared surgical closure of the mesenteric defects with leaving the defects open. The reports did not give details on geographic location, funding, or participant demographics.\n\nMain results  \n- Closing the mesenteric defects probably reduces the chance of an internal hernia with bowel obstruction, but the certainty of this evidence is low.  \n- Closing the defects makes little or no difference to overall complications within the first month after surgery.  \n- We cannot tell whether closure changes the risk of death within 30 days or the number of intra‑operative complications; the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- Closing the defects may increase the length of hospital stay slightly, but this result is also very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and varied in the types of participants and how the intervention was delivered.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",
