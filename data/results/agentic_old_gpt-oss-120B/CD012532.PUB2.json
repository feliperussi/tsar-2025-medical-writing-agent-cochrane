Evidence on serious adverse events (harmful side‑effects that need hospitalisation or are life‑threatening) is uncertain.  \n- A very small trial of pembrolizumab (an anti‑PD‑1 drug) given before surgery (neoadjuvant) and after surgery (adjuvant) suggested possible survival benefits, but the data are very limited. Combining anti‑PD‑1 drugs with bevacizumab (a drug that blocks new blood‑vessel growth) did not show clear benefit.  \n- Future research should use larger, well‑designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs, studies where participants are randomly assigned to a new treatment or a comparison) with longer follow‑up, identify tumour characteristics such as MGMT gene methylation status (methylated = DNA has a methyl group attached, often making the tumour more sensitive to chemotherapy; unmethylated = DNA lacks the group, often making it less responsive), and monitor safety carefully.\n\nWhat is glioblastoma and why is its treatment challenging?  \nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult brain tumour. Even with maximal surgery, radiation and temozolomide (an oral chemotherapy that damages DNA), most people live about 16 months after diagnosis. GBM creates an immunosuppressive (decreases the body’s immune response) microenvironment that hides the tumour from immune cells, so many new drugs that work in other cancers have not helped GBM patients.\n\nWhat are anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies and how might they help?  \nAnti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, medicines that block checkpoint proteins such as PD‑1 or PD‑L1, releasing the “brakes” on‑the‑immune system). PD‑1 is a protein on T‑cells (a type of immune cell) that reduces their activity when activated. PD‑L1 is a protein on tumour cells that binds PD‑1 and turns off the immune attack. By blocking this interaction, the drugs aim to let the immune system recognise and destroy cancer cells.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to determine whether anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies improve the lives of adults with diffuse glioma (a brain tumour that spreads through brain tissue rather than forming a single lump). We looked at:  \n- Overall survival (how long people live after treatment)  \n- Progression‑free survival (how long the tumour stays stable)  \n- Serious adverse events (important side‑effects that could be harmful)  \nWe also examined overall response rate (percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks), quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), and less serious side‑effects.\n\nHow did we search for studies?  \nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and trial registries for studies that evaluated anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies in adults with diffuse glioma. We placed a no‑language, no‑date limit. We included RCTs, non‑randomised comparative studies and single‑arm phase I/II trials that reported survival, response or safety outcomes. Two reviewers extracted data independently and resolved differences by consensus. We pooled hazard ratios (a measure of how often an event happens in one group compared with another over time) for survival and risk ratios (a measure of the risk of an event in one group compared with another) for response and safety using a random‑effects model. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool (for RCTs) and ROBINS‑I (for non‑randomised studies) and graded certainty with the GRADE framework.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified seven randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1 953 adults with grade 4 diffuse glioma (glioblastoma). Four trials enrolled patients with recurrent disease and three enrolled newly diagnosed patients. Trial sizes ranged from 35 to 716 participants. All studies tested anti‑PD‑1 antibodies – mainly nivolumab or pembrolizumab – given alone or with bevacizumab, radiation or temozolomide. No anti‑PD‑L1 trials were found.\n\nMain results  \n- In recurrent glioblastoma, nivolumab alone probably makes little or no difference to overall survival or progression‑free survival.  \n- Adding nivolumab to radiation for newly diagnosed glioblastoma with unmethylated MGMT DNA probably makes little or no difference to survival or tumour control.  \n- Adding nivolumab to radiation plus temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT DNA probably makes little or no difference to survival or tumour control, but probably increases serious adverse events.  \n- Giving nivolumab with temozolomide after surgery to older patients probably makes little or no difference to survival or tumour control.  \n- Pembrolizumab given before and after surgery (neoadjuvant + adjuvant) in recurrent disease may reduce death and tumour progression, but the evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot be sure it helps.  \n- Combining anti‑PD‑1 drugs with bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma does not appear to improve outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence is low to very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the findings because some studies may not have blinded participants, not all reported needed data, patient groups and treatment methods, and many trials were small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",
