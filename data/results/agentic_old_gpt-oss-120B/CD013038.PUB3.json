  "text": "Does letting preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk help them reach full oral feeding sooner?\n\nKey messages  \n- Giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeds does not clearly speed up the time to full sucking feeds, and no harmful effects were reported.  \n- The same studies showed little or no impact on the length of time on parenteral nutrition (nutrients given directly into a vein), on reaching full enteral feeds (feeding directly into the gut), or on serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.  \n- Because the trials were small and had design flaws, we need larger, well‑designed studies to know whether this low‑cost intervention can improve feeding outcomes or safety.\n\nWhat is the problem with feeding preterm babies?  \nPreterm infants often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing. We therefore give them nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube – a thin tube that passes through the nose into the stomach). This method bypasses the nose and mouth, so the baby does not smell or taste milk. Lack of sensory exposure can cause feeding intolerance, delay full enteral feeds, lengthen hospital stay, and increase the risk of infection or necrotising enterocolitis.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe asked whether providing the smell, the taste, or both of breast‑milk or formula at the same time as tube feeding helps babies reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we wanted to know if this easy, non‑invasive action can speed the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major databases for studies that compared milk smell or taste exposure with tube feeding versus no exposure in preterm infants. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, combined results in meta‑analyses, and rated certainty using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that included 1,277 preterm babies who were receiving tube feeds because they could not yet coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing. In some babies we gave the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula during the tube feed; other babies received the tube feed alone.\n\nProviding the smell and taste of milk together with tube feeds probably makes little or no difference to how quickly infants reach full sucking feeds, and the evidence is very low certainty. It also probably has little or no effect on the time needed to reach full enteral feeds, with very uncertain evidence. The intervention may make little or no difference to the number of days infants need parenteral nutrition, to the chance of developing necrotising enterocolitis, or to the risk of late infection. No clear adverse effects (unwanted or harmful side‑effects) were seen.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies did not randomly assign babies to groups, which can introduce bias (flaws that favour one result). Some trials were open‑label, so staff may have known which babies received the intervention. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, the participants and methods varied, and the sample sizes were small. Because of these issues, we are not confident in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched up to April 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",
