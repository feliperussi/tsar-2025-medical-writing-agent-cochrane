  "text": "Does lying face‑down after eye surgery for a macula‑involving retinal detachment reduce retinal shifting compared with other positions?  \n\nKey messages  \n- We found that face‑down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy (a surgery that removes the gel inside the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble) may lower the chance of retinal displacement (the retina moving out of place), but the evidence is limited and uncertain.  \n- We saw no clear difference in visual acuity (sharpness of vision) or visual distortion (image warping) between face‑down and other positions.  \n- Because the studies were few, small, and of low quality, we need larger, well‑designed list.  \n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment and why does it matter?  \nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a serious eye emergency where the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away from its normal position. When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that provides the sharpest vision – people can lose detailed sight quickly. This can affect daily activities such as reading, driving, or recognizing faces.  \n\nHow is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what is the idea behind post‑surgery positioning?  \nSurgeons most often perform pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and fill the eye with a gas bubble (gas tamponade). The gas pushes the retina back into place while it heals. Some surgeons ask patients to lie face‑down for a period after the operation. We believe this position keeps the gas bubble in contact with the retinal break and may prevent retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia (visual distortions) and binocular diplopia (double vision when both eyes are used together).  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to determine whether lying face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the chance of retinal displacement and related problems compared with other post‑surgery positions (called “support‑the‑break” or face‑up).  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials and observational cohort studies that reported retinal displacement, visual acuity, or other relevant outcomes after vitrectomy for macula‑involving retinal detachment. We excluded studies without a comparator group or lacking outcome data.  \n\nHow did we select and analyse the studies?  \nTwo reviewers independently applied the eligibility criteria (the reasons a person can be included in, or excluded from, a study) and extracted data on participants, positioning protocols, and outcomes. We resolved disagreements by consensus. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (a measure of the risk of an event in one group compared with another) and continuous outcomes as mean differences, each with 95 % confidence intervals (the defined range of numbers used to describe where the results are expected to fall). We assessed heterogeneity with the I² statistic and performed sensitivity analyses by removing high‑risk studies.  \n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?  \nWe graded the certainty of each outcome using the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three small randomised trials that together included 368 people (369 eyes) with primary macula‑involving retinal detachment repaired with PPV and a gas bubble. Most participants were men (about two‑thirds). Only one trial reported participants’ ethnicity (a group of people who share cultural, social, or ancestral traits), trial registration, and funding; the others did not. The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with other strategies such as “support‑the‑break” or face‑up (sometimes with additional fluid). Outcomes were measured up to about six months after surgery.  \n\nWhat are the main results?  \n- It is unclear whether immediate face‑down positioning reduces retinal displacement.  \n- It is unclear whether face‑down positioning changes visual acuity three months after surgery.  \n- It is unclear whether face‑down positioning influences postoperative (after surgery) visual distortion or quality‑of‑life (how someone feels and functions day to day) scores around six months.  \n- It is unclear whether face‑down positioning lowers the risk of the eye for outer retinal folds (small wrinkles on the retina surface) or binocular diplopia.  \n- It is unclear whether the position raises the risk of increased intraocular pressure (pressure inside the eye).  \n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and of limited quality.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies up to November 2022.",
