  "text": "Do programmes that change care‑home policies and train staff reduce the use of physical restraints (devices that limit movement, such as bed‑rails or belts) for older adults in long‑term care?\n\nKey messages  \n- Organisational interventions (programmes that change care‑home policies and staff practice) probably reduce the number of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and the studies reported no serious adverse events (unwanted problems that cause harm). The evidence comes from several well‑designed trials and is fairly reliable.  \n- Simple educational sessions that only aim to increase staff knowledge, and interventions that only give staff information about each resident’s fall risk, did not show a clear reduction in restraint use.  \n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that look at long‑term outcomes, possible harms, and settings outside residential care.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?  \nMany older adults in care homes or receiving home care are fitted with physical restraints. Staff often because they hope restraints will prevent falls, protect the person from harming themselves, or make care easier. Research shows restraints do not reliably prevent falls or injuries. They can cause bruises, pressure sores, reduced mobility, and even death. People with dementia (a condition in which a person loses the ability to think, remember, learn, make decisions, and solve problems) are especially vulnerable. Because of these safety concerns, health organisations worldwide recommend avoiding restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can help care homes and community services reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people who need long‑term care. We looked at two main types of programmes:  \n\n- Organisational interventions – strategies that change the whole facility’s policies and culture (the shared beliefs, values, and behaviours of a group), such as introducing a “least‑restraint” policy, training staff champions, and providing ongoing support.  \n- Simple educational interventions – short training sessions or information aimed at improving staff knowledge and attitudes about restraints.  \n\nWe compared these programmes with usual care (the care that a provider would normally give) to see if they lowered the number of residents who are restrained, reduced how long restraints are used, and affected other outcomes such as falls, fall‑related injuries, psychotropic medication (drugs that affect mood, thinking or behaviour) use, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day), or agitation (restlessness, irritability, or inability to stay calm).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched multiple databases using relevant keywords and MeSH terms. We included both published and unpublished studies that evaluated interventions to prevent or reduce physical restraints for older people in long‑term care. We pooled eligible studies and combined their results with meta‑analytic techniques where appropriate. We calculated effect sizes and presented confidence intervals. We rated the overall confidence in the evidence using GRADE, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 11 controlled trials – ten randomised controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial – involving 19,003 older adults living in long‑term residential care facilities. All participants had dementia and the average age was about 85 years. The trials tested three types of interventions:  \n\n- Organisational programmes that introduced a least‑restraint policy (four studies).  \n- Simple educational programmes aimed at improving staff knowledge and attitudes (six studies).  \n- One study that gave staff information about each resident’s fall risk.  \n\nMost trials compared the programme with usual care; two trials also gave the control groups some information about reducing restraints. No studies examined community settings or people without dementia.\n\nMain results  \nOrganisational programmes probably reduce the number of residents who are restrained at all – about 10 fewer per 100 residents. They probably cause a large reduction in belt restraints – about 45 fewer per 100 residents. These programmes may make little or no difference to the number of falls, fall‑related injuries, psychotropic medication use, quality of life, or agitation.  \n\nSimple educational sessions have uncertain effects on how many residents are restrained – we do not know whether they change restraint use. They probably make little or no difference to how intensely restraints are used and may make little or no difference to falls, fall‑related injuries, and agitation; we are uncertain about any effect on medication use.  \n\nProviding staff with information about each resident’s fall risk may make little or no difference to overall restraint use and to the number of falls.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because participants may have known which programme they received, which can influence results. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. The studies involved different types of people and delivered the interventions in varied ways. There are not enough studies to be certain, and the evidence does not cover all people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe updated our previous review. The evidence is current to August 2022.",
