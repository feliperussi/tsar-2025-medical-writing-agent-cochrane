People feel motivated by reassurance and lifestyle‑changing advice, but fear of bad news, time limits, cost worries and lack of health‑insurance coverage can deter attendance; trusted, skilled and culturally‑competent providers (providers who have the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to respect people’s cultural backgrounds) encourage participation, while experiences with unqualified staff discourage it; cultural, social and religious (a set of beliefs and practices about life’s meaning) beliefs and language also affect whether people view prevention (actions taken to reduce risk of disease) positively. No direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.  \n- All three groups stress that how the service is organised matters. Providers need appropriate training and cultural competence, and checks should be offered in convenient, innovative and diverse settings (new or different places such as workplaces or community centres). Delivery is often hampered by competition with curative care, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement issues, which can reduce access and uptake (the extent to which people actually use a service).  \n- Because many findings come from a limited number of qualitative studies and some contextual factors remain unclear, we need more research to understand why health systems choose to commission (decide to fund, organise and oversee) these checks, how cultural and social contexts affect uptake, and what alternatives might be acceptable before any large‑scale reduction or removal of the service.  \n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they important?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments where a person who feels well is offered a series of screening (checking for disease in people with no symptoms) tests – for example blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar or cancer checks – to see if any health problems are developing early. Many health systems run these checks as part of preventive care, hoping that early detection will keep people healthier and reduce deaths. However, a 2019 Cochrane review (a high‑quality systematic review produced by the Cochrane Collaboration) of effectiveness (how well a treatment works) studies found that these checks have little or no impact on overall mortality (death) or on specific conditions such as cardiovascular (heart and blood‑vessel) disease or cancer. Because the numbers do not show clear benefit, we want to understand how different stakeholder groups (people or groups who have an interest in or are affected by a health program) view these checks, what they experience when they are offered, and what helps or hinders their use.  \n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?  \nWe aimed to explore the thoughts and experiences of all key stakeholders involved in general health checks. Specifically, we wanted to discover how health‑service managers and policymakers (people who create rules or policies that affect health services) decide whether to fund and organise checks (commissioning), how health‑care providers (clinicians who deliver care) deliver them, and how clients – both attendees and non‑attendees – perceive their value. By gathering these qualitative (non‑numeric) insights, we hoped to add context to the earlier Cochrane review and to help decide whether and how general health checks should continue, be changed, or be replaced with other approaches.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched databases (organized collections of research information) for qualitative studies that examined stakeholder views on commissioning, delivering and using general health checks. We extracted data using a framework synthesis approach (a way of organizing findings into a pre‑designed structure) and assessed confidence in each finding with GRADE‑CERQual (a system that judges how much trust to place in qualitative evidence).  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies that explored how different people think and feel about general health checks. From these, we purposively selected 36 studies for deeper analysis. Most research came from high‑income European countries, but about a third were from middle‑income settings in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Studies were conducted in primary‑care or community health centres, workplaces and broader community settings. Participants represented three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (covered in 25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies) and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies focused on checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.  \n\nMain findings (list of findings)  \n- General health checks probably give a large boost to clients’ motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles.  \n- Fear of receiving bad results probably reduces attendance.  \n- Understanding one’s disease (an abnormal condition that affects the body) risk probably increases the likelihood of attending a check.  \n- Clients often feel a sense of responsibility to stay healthy for their families and society, which probably encourages attendance.  \n- Encouragement from health‑care providers probably increases attendance, while negative experiences with unqualified providers probably deter people.  \n- Easy availability, convenient access and good invitation systems (methods such as letters or calls that ask people to attend) probably increase attendance; concerns about time constraints and costs probably reduce it.  \n- Skilled and culturally‑competent providers probably lead to a large increase in acceptance of checks.  \n- Competing demands from curative care, staff shortages and limited resources probably make delivery harder.  \n- Offering checks in innovative or diverse settings probably improves access.  \n- Providing a comprehensive (complete, thorough) range of tests may slightly increase client satisfaction.  \n- Tailoring checks to an individual’s specific risk (individualised approach) may slightly improve perceived suitability.  \n- Different stakeholder groups may have moderate (medium) differences in how effective they think checks are.  \n- Clear information, invitation systems and education probably raise awareness of checks.  \n- Explaining test results and giving recommendations may slightly improve perceived value.  \n- It is unclear whether cultural background, social norms, religion, gender or language affect uptake.  \n- It is also unclear whether a favourable political climate (overall attitude of government leaders) and stakeholder support influence the decision to commission checks.  \n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving, which can introduce bias (flaws in study design that favor one conclusion).  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
