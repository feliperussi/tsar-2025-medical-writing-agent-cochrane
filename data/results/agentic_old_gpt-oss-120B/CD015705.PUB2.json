  "text": "How does the informal (not officially regulated or formally organized; done in a casual or unofficial way) use of personal mobile phones (hand‑held devices that let people make calls, send messages, and use apps while moving around) by healthcare workers affect their work and patient care?\n\nKey messages  \n- Using personal mobile phones makes us more flexible, efficient and able to respond quickly to patients, but it can create a financial burden and raise the risk of breaching confidentiality (protecting personal information from people who should not have access).  \n- These informal practices are now normal in many settings, so staff often feel pressure from colleagues or managers to use their own phones; the benefits and drawbacks appear across high‑, middle‑ and low‑income settings (places where people have limited financial resources and health systems have fewer supplies and staff).  \n- Because the evidence comes from qualitative studies (research that explores people’s thoughts, feelings or experiences using interviews or observations rather than numbers), we need clearer formal communication (official ways of sharing information such as emails or memos) and stronger information systems (computer‑based on tools that collect, store and manage data), plus policies, training and research that measure how phone use affects patient outcomes and staff well‑being.\n\nWhy do some healthcare workers use their own mobile phones at work?  \nIn many clinics, hospitals and community health sites the official tools are missing, broken or too slow. When this happens, doctors, nurses, community health volunteers and other staff turn to phones they already own. By calling, texting or using apps, we can quickly share patient information, ask for advice or arrange appointments. This informal use fills gaps in the system and helps us be more flexible and responsive to patients’ needs.\n\nWhat are the good and bad sides of using personal devices?  \nPersonal phones can make care quicker, more personal and sometimes protect patient privacy when official systems are insecure. They also let patients reach a specific health worker directly, strengthening trust. However, we often pay for calls, data or airtime (mobile‑phone credit that lets a person make calls or use the internet) out of our own pocket. This cost can be heavy for lower‑paid workers or those in low‑income settings. Working after hours on a personal phone blurs the line between work and home life. Storing patient details on a private device risks confidentiality and may widen inequities (unfair differences in health, resources or opportunities between groups). When information stays on personal phones instead of official records, it creates shadow IT (technology tools that staff use on their own without official approval or oversight), a hidden system the health organisation cannot see or control.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to understand how healthcare workers, managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal mobile phones to support their work. Specifically, we explored the benefits, challenges and everyday practices of these informal, innovative uses of technology in health services.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for qualitative evidence synthesis (a method of combining results from several studies that explore people’s experiences or opinions using non‑numeric data). We included studies that reported a qualitative component, either pure qualitative designs or mixed‑methods designs. Two reviewers extracted relevant data from each study and performed a thematic synthesis (a process of identifying and combining recurring ideas across studies). We assessed confidence (a rating that indicates how sure researchers are that a finding is reliable) in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies covered many countries – high‑, middle‑ and low‑income – and a range of health‑care environments and professional groups. All focused on health‑care workers’ informal, personal use of mobile phones (not tablets) to support their work. The review does not give details about the total number of participants, their ages, genders or other demographics.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \nWhen we use our own mobile phones informally, we become more flexible, efficient and able to respond quickly to patients’ needs. This can strengthen relationships with patients and colleagues. At the same time, informal use creates a large financial burden for us and carries a high risk of breaching patient confidentiality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident (the evidence is consistent across multiple independent studies) because the data are clear, but some studies have methodological limitations and small sample sizes, which reduce certainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",
