No serious adverse events (unwanted events that cause harm) were reported; participants experienced temporary mild‑to‑moderate side effects such as raised blood pressure (force of blood on vessel walls), nausea (stomach sickness), anxiety, emotional upset, or brief hallucination‑like experiences (seeing things that are not real while knowing they are not real).  \n- Evidence for MDMA (a drug sometimes called “Ecstasy”) is very uncertain because it comes from a single small trial, so we cannot be sure about its effects on anxiety or depression.  \n- We need larger, well‑designed randomised trials that follow participants for longer, keep participants and researchers blinded (unaware of which treatment was given), and monitor expectations and side effects systematically.\n\nWhy do people with life‑threatening illnesses often feel anxiety, depression, or existential distress?  \nWhen a serious disease such as cancer is diagnosed, the future can feel uncertain and frightening. This can trigger strong worry, persistent sadness and a deep sense that life lacks meaning. These feelings are common and can make it harder to cope with treatment and lower quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). Usual help includes counselling, antidepressant medicines or other mental‑health support, but many patients still struggle.\n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy and how is it used?  \nIn this approach a person takes a psychedelic drug – such as psilocybin (a substance taken from “magic” mushrooms), LSD or MDMA – under close supervision by trained clinicians. Before the drug session we hold preparatory meetings to set expectations and build trust. After the session we hold integration meetings to help the person make sense of the experience. The drug‑induced altered state of consciousness may open a window for new insights, reduced fear and emotional relief. Because most of these substances are illegal in many countries and can cause side effects, researchers are still studying whether the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe compared psychedelic‑assisted therapy with a placebo (a dummy treatment that looks like the drug but contains no active medicine) or with other active treatments such as standard antidepressants. Our goal was to see whether the psychedelic approach can safely reduce anxiety, depression and existential distress in people facing life‑threatening diseases, and to identify any harms that might occur.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that examined psychedelic‑assisted therapy in adults with serious illnesses. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participants, drug protocol, outcomes and results. We described the findings qualitatively and, where possible, combined results using random‑effects models. We rated the certainty we have in each result with the GRADE framework, which looks at risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 149 adults with serious illnesses such as cancer; data from 140 participants (aged 36 to 64) were analysed. The trials were conducted in outpatient (patients who visit a clinic but do not stay overnight) settings in the United States and Switzerland and lasted six to twelve months. Funding came from organisations that support psychedelic research, not from drug companies. Two types of psychedelic‑assistance were tested: (1) classic psychedelics – psilocybin or LSD – and (2) MDMA. Both were given together with preparatory and follow‑up psychotherapy and were compared with an active placebo or a low‑dose version of the drug.\n\nOur synthesis suggests that classic psychedelics may lower anxiety, but we have low certainty about this finding. They may also produce a small reduction in depression, again with low certainty. We are very uncertain whether these therapies ease existential distress, improve overall quality of life or affect spiritual experiences (deep feelings about purpose, peace and connection). No serious side‑effects were reported in the small studies, but because the evidence is limited we cannot be sure that serious harms will not occur.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence because participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias). Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies published up to March 2024.",
