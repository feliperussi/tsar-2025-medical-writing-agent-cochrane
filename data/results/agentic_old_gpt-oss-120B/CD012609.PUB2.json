People often have abdominal pain, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), weight loss and fatigue. These symptoms make daily life hard and can lead to bowel blockage or malnutrition. The disease flares up and then settles down. Doctors aim to keep patients in remission (a period when signs and symptoms are reduced or disappear). Maintaining remission improves quality of life and protects the gut from permanent damage.\n\nHow do we treat Crohn’s disease?  \nStandard treatments include steroids, immunosuppressants and newer biologics. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein that binds to one specific target). It attaches to tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), a protein that drives inflammation, and blocks its action. This reduces gut inflammation and helps maintain remission. Other options are biosimilars (highly similar copies of the original biologic) and different biologics such as adalimumab (another monoclonal antibody that blocks TNF‑α).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether infliximab is effective and safe for keeping Crohn’s disease in remission. Specifically, we compared infliximab with placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the real medication) or with other active medicines. We looked at clinical relapse (a return of disease symptoms after improvement), loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse (disease seen again during a scope exam, even if symptoms are absent), and withdrawals because of adverse events (unwanted events that cause harm) or serious adverse events (unwanted medical problems that are severe enough to cause hospitalization, disability or be life‑threatening).\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintenance of remission. We combined the results to assess relapse and safety outcomes. We graded our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system (a method that rates how sure we can be about the results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified nine trials that enrolled 1,257 participants aged 18‑69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received biologic therapy before; two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve patients. At baseline, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one enrolled only patients with fistulating disease (abnormal tunnels between intestine and other tissues). Most trials were multicentre and conducted in unspecified countries. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, mixed public‑commercial sources, public bodies, or was not reported.\n\nMain results  \n- Moderate‑certainty evidence (research findings that are fairly reliable but still have some limitations) suggests infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse. For roughly every 100 patients, about 20 fewer may relapse compared with placebo.  \n- Adding infliximab to purine‑analogue therapy probably produces a large reduction in relapse. For every 100 patients, roughly 50 fewer may relapse than with purine analogues alone.  \n- Compared with a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little or no difference to relapse risk (low‑certainty evidence).  \n- Infliximab may increase loss of clinical response compared with a biosimilar (low‑certainty evidence). About 15 more per 100 patients might lose response.  \n- Infliximab may cause a large increase in withdrawals because of adverse events compared with a biosimilar (low‑certainty evidence). Many more per 100 patients may stop treatment due to side‑effects.  \n- For serious adverse events, infliximab may make little or no difference compared with a biosimilar (low‑certainty evidence).  \n- Evidence for many other comparisons (e.g., infliximab versus adalimumab, subcutaneous (under the skin) versus intravenous (into a vein) biosimilar) is very uncertain, so we cannot draw reliable conclusions.\n\nWhat are the evidence’s limitations?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, increasing risk of bias. Some trials also had missing data, reducing precision.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?  \nWe can be fairly sure that infliximab lowers the chance of disease returning compared with no treatment, and that combining it with purine analogues further reduces relapse risk. However, we remain uncertain about differences in safety and about how infliximab compares with many other active medicines. Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to clarify long‑term benefits and harms.",
