  "text": "Are strengthening exercises (planned activities to increase muscle force) effective for treating knee‑front tendon pain (patellar tendinopathy – a painful irritation of the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone) compared with no treatment, steroid injections (shots that reduce inflammation) or surgery (an operation to repair tissue)?\n\nKey messages  \n- Strengthening exercises may reduce knee‑front tendon pain compared with doing nothing, but the evidence is very uncertain because it comes from small, low‑quality studies. The same uncertainty applies when we compare exercises with steroid injections or surgery, and the studies did not report any unwanted events that cause harm (adverse events).  \n- The limited evidence suggests that exercises might give small improvements in the ability to perform activities (function) and in overall treatment success (a single patient‑rated score of how well the treatment worked). They also appear to give a similar chance of getting back to sport (return to sport – the proportion of athletes who can play again) as surgery, but these findings are uncertain and were observed only in young athletic participants.  \n- We need larger, well‑designed studies that include a broader range of people, report any possible harms, and follow participants for longer periods, to determine whether strengthening exercises truly help with pain, function and return to sport for patellar tendinopathy.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why does it matter?  \nPatellar tendinopathy, often called “jumper’s knee,” causes a dull ache at the front of the knee during jumping, running or quick changes of direction. It is common among athletes and active people and can keep them from training or competing for months or years. The tendon heals poorly on its own, so the pain can become long‑lasting (chronic) and affect how someone feels and functions day to day (quality of life). Usual treatments include different exercise programmes, surgery and steroid injections. One popular type of exercise is eccentric loading (muscle lengthening under load, such as slowly lowering from a squat), but we do not know how well these approaches work compared with doing nothing, surgery or injections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe aimed to determine whether strengthening exercise programmes for the knee‑extensor muscles can reduce pain, improve function, help athletes get back to sport and avoid harms in people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. We compared exercise with no treatment, with steroid injections, with surgery and with other active therapies.\n\nHow did we look‑for the evidence?  \nWe searched multiple electronic databases for randomised controlled trials that compared strengthening exercises with other interventions or no treatment for patellar tendinopathy. We combined the identified studies using meta‑analysis techniques and judged the overall confidence in the evidence with the GRADE system (a systematic approach that rates how confident we can be in research findings).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified seven trials that together enrolled 211 participants with chronic patellar tendinopathy. All participants were athletes, 88% were male, the average age was 26 years and symptoms had lasted about 42 months on average. The trials compared strengthening exercises with: no treatment (3 trials, 93 participants), steroid injection (1 trial, 38 participants), surgery (1 trial, 40 participants), stretching exercise (1 trial, 15 participants) and pulsed ultrasound with transverse friction (1 trial, 30 participants). No study used a placebo or sham intervention, and none reported any unwanted events that cause harm.\n\nMain results  \n- Compared with no treatment, we are uncertain whether strengthening exercises reduce knee pain. The effect on function is also uncertain.  \n- Compared with a steroid injection, strengthening probably makes little or no difference to pain or function.  \n- Compared with surgery, we cannot tell whether exercises reduce pain or improve function.  \n- For overall treatment success and for return to sport, exercises may make little or no difference; roughly the same proportion of athletes (about 85 out of 100) returned to sport after exercise or after surgery.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the findings because participants likely knew which treatment they received (performance bias) and the studies were very small. Not all trials reported every outcome we were interested in, and none reported adverse events. The overall certainty of the evidence is low‑certainty (limited confidence because of small size, bias or inconsistent results).\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
