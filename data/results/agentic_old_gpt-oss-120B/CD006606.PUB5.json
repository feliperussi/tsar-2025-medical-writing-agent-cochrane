IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage (loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks) and reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a serious reaction to fertility drugs).  \n- Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) and congenital anomalies (birth defects) appear similar between IVM and standard IVF/ICSI, although the data are limited.  \n- Because the studies are few and small, we need more well‑designed randomised trials to clarify the true benefits and harms of IVM, especially for live‑birth rates, long‑term child health, and the best ways to perform IVM.  \n\nWhat is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and how does it affect a woman's chance of getting pregnant?  \nPCOS is a common hormonal condition that affects about 8 %–13 % of women of child‑bearing age. Women with PCOS often have irregular periods and many small cysts on their ovaries. These changes make it harder for the ovaries to release mature eggs, so many women experience infertility (the inability to become pregnant after a year of regular, unprotected sex). About half of all women who seek fertility help have PCOS.  \n\nWhy can standard fertility treatments be problematic for women with PCOS?  \nWhen natural conception is unlikely, we use assisted reproductive technology (procedures that use eggs and sperm to create embryos outside the body, such as IVF). In IVF (in‑vitro fertilisation) we collect eggs, fertilise them with sperm in a laboratory, and place the embryos back into the uterus. ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) injects a single sperm directly into an egg. To collect enough eggs we give high‑dose medicines that stimulate the ovaries – a process called controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). In women with PCOS these medicines often cause the ovaries to over‑respond, producing many immature eggs of uneven quality and raising the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can cause abdominal swelling, pain and fluid buildup. Because of these risks we look for gentler approaches.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe compared two approaches for women with PCOS who need assisted reproduction of a baby:  \n1. Standard IVF/ICSI that uses high‑dose hormone stimulation.  \n2. In‑vitro maturation (IVM), where we retrieve immature eggs earlier (at the germinal‑vesicle stage) and let them mature in the laboratory before fertilisation.  \n\nWe asked whether IVM changes live‑birth rates, miscarriage risk, OHSS risk, preterm birth and birth‑defect risk.  \n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched for randomised trials that compared IVM before IVF/ICSI with standard IVF/ICSI in subfertile women with PCOS. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified four randomised trials that together involved 810 women with PCOS. We randomly assigned women to IVM (immature eggs collected, matured in the lab, then fertilised) or to standard IVF/ICSI using a GnRH‑antagonist protocol (a medicine that blocks natural hormone signals to prevent ovarian overstimulation).  \n\nWe are very uncertain whether IVM changes the chance of a live birth or of becoming pregnant. Our higher‑certainty findings show two clear effects:  \n\n- Miscarriage: IVM probably increases the chance‑of‑loss. If about 20 out of 100 women using IVF have a miscarriage, the number could rise to around 40 out of 100 with IVM.  \n- OHSS: IVM markedly reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. If roughly 4 out of 100 women undergoing IVF develop this complication, IVM lowers the risk to almost zero.  \n\nThe evidence also suggests that IVM probably makes little or no difference to the chance of preterm birth, and low‑certainty evidence indicates it probably does not change the risk of birth defects.  \n\nOverall, we do not know if IVM improves the chance of a live birth. It appears to raise miscarriage risk but markedly lowers OHSS risk, with little impact on preterm birth or congenital anomalies.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies involved different types of women and varied protocols, and the trials were small.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe updated our previous review with studies searched up to February 2023.",
