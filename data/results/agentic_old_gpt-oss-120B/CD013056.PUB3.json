About one extra person out of four has a dry ear (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n- The studies we found were few, small, and of limited quality. We have low confidence that the true benefits or harms of either antibiotics or antiseptics are known. Important outcomes such as quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) or serious complications (harmful effects such as damage to hearing structures) were not measured.  \n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed randomised controlled trials that follow patients longer, compare different antibiotic and antiseptic ear drops, and record side‑effects, hearing changes, and impacts on daily life.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?  \nChronic suppurative otitis media (a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear that causes ongoing ear discharge through a hole in the eardrum) affects the middle ear and the nearby mastoid cavity (the hollow space inside the bone behind the ear). The eardrum (tympanic membrane – a thin, drum‑like membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear) develops a perforation, allowing pus‑filled fluid (otorrhoea – fluid that drips or oozes out of the ear) to leak out. People hear constant or intermittent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, interfere with daily activities, and lead to more serious ear problems if not treated well. The infection is usually polymicrobial (caused by several types of bacteria), so doctors aim to eliminate the germs.\n\nWhat medicines are used?  \nTwo main types of topical medicines are used. **Antibiotics** (medications used to treat infection caused by bacteria) are applied directly into the ear as drops. Examples include quinolones (a group of antibiotics that kill a wide range of bacteria and are often used as ear‑drop medicines) and aminoglycosides (a class of antibiotics that work mainly against certain bacteria and are sometimes used as ear drops). **Antise of antiseptics** (germ‑killing cleaning agents) are also applied as drops, powders, or washes. Common antiseptics are boric acid (a mild antiseptic solution), acetic acid (a weak acid that can inhibit microbes), povidone‑iodine (a liquid antiseptic that contains iodine and kills germs), and aluminium acetate (a chemical ear‑drop solution that helps dry the ear and reduce infection). Both aim to stop the infection and clear the discharge, but it is unclear which works better or is safer.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotic ear drops versus antiseptic ear drops for people with chronic suppurative otitis media. Specifically, we looked at whether one treatment makes the ear dry (no more discharge) faster, reduces ear pain or irritation, improves hearing, or affects overall quality of life. We also examined serious side‑effects such as ototoxicity (damage to hearing structures).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups) that compared antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with chronic suppurative otitis media. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system (a method that grades how certain we are about research results).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 15 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 2,371 participants (children and adults). The trials compared ear drops containing quinolones or aminoglycosides with ear drops containing antiseptics such as acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine or aluminium acetate. Some studies also performed aural toileting (cleaning the ear canal by flushing or suctioning) in both groups. No trial reported health‑related quality‑of‑life outcomes or serious complications, and five additional studies (966 participants) that examined other comparisons were not detailed.\n\nMain results  \n- Quinolone antibiotics probably increase the chance that ear discharge stops within two weeks compared with boric‑acid ear drops – about one extra person out of four will have a dry ear (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n- Acetic acid may increase the chance of discharge stopping within two weeks when compared with aminoglycoside ear drops, but the evidence is low‑certainty and we are very uncertain how it compares with quinolones.  \n- Very low‑certainty evidence suggests acetic acid might cause less ear pain or irritation than antibiotic ear drops.  \n- Quinolone antibiotics may reduce ear pain, discomfort or irritation compared with boric acid (low‑certainty evidence).  \n- Quinolone antibiotics probably do not differ from povidone‑iodine in stopping discharge within two weeks (very low‑certainty evidence).  \n- Quinolone antibiotics may lead to a small improvement in hearing compared with boric acid, but the difference is unlikely to be clinically important (low‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, many studies were very small, and not all outcomes of interest were reported. The evidence does not cover all people, interventions, or outcomes we wanted to know about.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work. The evidence is current to June 2022.",
