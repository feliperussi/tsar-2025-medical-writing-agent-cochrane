It affects many women worldwide, leading to embarrassment, reduced daily activities, and costly medical visits.\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a minimally‑invasive surgery that uses a short synthetic (man‑made) strip of mesh placed through a tiny cut (incision) in the front (anterior) vaginal wall. The strip supports the middle part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the bladder). Because only one small incision is needed, the procedure is marketed as causing less postoperative (after surgery) pain, quicker recovery, and fewer complications than older sling techniques.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe aimed to compare single‑incision slings with other common treatments—retropubic slings, transobturator slings, and autologous fascial slings (tissue taken from the same person)—to see how well they improve symptoms and what side‑effects they cause. We also looked for any cost‑effectiveness studies.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library without date or language limits. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts independently and resolved disagreements together. We extracted data on participants, interventions, outcomes (for example cure rate, complications), and follow‑up length. When possible, we combined results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and assessed confidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 randomised trials that enrolled 8 051 women with stress‑dominant urinary incontinence. Ten trials compared single‑incision slings with retropubic slings, 51 trials compared them with transobturator slings, and one small trial (70 women) compared them with an autologous fascial sling. Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which has been withdrawn; we analysed those separately. No studies compared single‑incision slings with no treatment, conservative therapy, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n- Effectiveness: At 12 months, single‑incision slings gave similar cure or improvement rates as retropubic slings (low‑certainty evidence) and as transobturator slings (high‑certainty evidence).  \n- Post‑operative pain: Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably result in considerably less pain two years after surgery (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n- Mesh exposure: The chance of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion was comparable between single‑incision and transobturator slings (high‑certainty evidence). Evidence versus retropubic slings remains very uncertain.  \n- Urinary retention: Single‑incision slings likely reduce the chance of postoperative urinary retention a little compared with transobturator slings (moderate‑certainty evidence). The effect versus retropubic slings is unclear.  \n- Quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day): Women with single‑incision slings may report slightly lower quality of life at 12 months compared with transobturator slings (low‑certainty evidence).  \n- Repeat surgery or sling revision: We did not have enough data to decide whether single‑incision slings increase or decrease the need for further continence surgery.  \n- Other outcomes: Very limited data exist on dyspareunia (painful sex) or mesh‑related complications when single‑incision slings are compared with autologous fascial slings.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, participants often knew which sling they received, and the trials of different populations used varied methods. The evidence does not cover all patient groups, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies published up to September 2022.",
