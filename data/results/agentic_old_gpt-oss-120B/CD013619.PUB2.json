The evidence is limited and judged very low certainty, so the true effect could be different.  \n- We found no clear difference in how long cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR – – an emergency procedure used to restart a person’s heartbeat and breathing after they have stopped) lasts, nor in the stress experienced by healthcare staff when families are present.  \n- We need more large, well‑designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs – studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) to confirm any benefits or harms for families, patients, and staff.  \n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation and why does it matter?  \nWhen a person’s heart stops or they become critically ill, medical teams perform emergency CPR to restart the heart and restore breathing. These moments are fast‑moving and stressful, often occurring in an emergency department or in an ambulance. Many patients and their loved ones want the family nearby, and families sometimes ask to watch. Allowing relatives to stay is called family presence during resuscitation (FPDR – allowing a patient’s family members to stay in the room while medical staff perform emergency life‑saving measures). FPDR creates a three‑way interaction among the patient, the family, and the healthcare professionals. Some families feel comforted; others may become distressed. Clinicians worry that a crowd could interfere with care. Understanding these effects helps hospitals decide whether to offer FPDR as routine practice.  \n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe asked four questions:  \n1. Does offering families the chance to watch CPR increase or decrease PTSD symptoms in those families?  \n2. Do families who are present experience other mental‑health effects such as anxiety, depression, or complicated grief?  \n3. Does family presence change patient outcomes, such as the length of CPR, survival, or complications (morbidity – the number of people who develop a disease, and mortality – the number of deaths)?  \n4. Does FPDR affect how staff deliver care, their own stress levels, or their attitudes toward family presence?  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and other databases from their start dates to March 2022. Two reviewers screened records, extracted data, and combined findings narratively. We assessed confidence in each result using a structured tool that considers risk of bias, consistency, and applicability.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified only two RCTs that examined FPDR, involving a total of 595 adult relatives (about 60 % women, ages 19‑78). The larger study was a cluster‑randomised trial – a study where whole groups such as hospitals or ambulance teams are randomly assigned – conducted in France in 2013. It offered families the option to watch CPR in the pre‑hospital setting and followed them for up to 12 months. The smaller study was a pilot trial from the UK emergency department in 1998. Both trials compared families who were offered the option with families who received usual care (no family presence).  \n\nIn the French trial, fewer relatives in the FPDR group reported PTSD symptoms after 3 and 12 months. Per‑protocol analyses also suggested lower anxiety, depression, and complicated grief after one year. However, both trials had high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of the evidence was judged very low. We therefore cannot be confident that family presence truly reduces these problems. Both trials showed no clear difference in the duration of CPR or in the personal stress reported by healthcare professionals.  \n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nParticipants knew whether they were in the FPDR or control group, which may have influenced results. Not all outcomes of interest were reported, and only two small studies were available. These factors limit our confidence in the findings.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies up to March 2022, so the evidence reflects research published before that date.",
