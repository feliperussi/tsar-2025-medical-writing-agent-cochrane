  "text": "Do anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block a protein that makes new blood‑vessel growth, also called vascular endothelial growth factor) combined with vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes the gel‑like vitreous) improve outcomes for people with severe diabetic eye disease?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding anti‑VEGF injections before or during vitrectomy may give slightly sharper vision, lower the chance of bleeding inside the eye soon after surgery and later on, and reduce tears in the retina during the operation; no serious side‑effects were reported, but the overall quality of the evidence is limited.\n- Evidence on other outcomes such as the need for additional surgery, the use of silicone oil (a temporary oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place) and patients’ quality of life is unclear because few studies reported these results.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients longer and use consistent outcome measures are needed to confirm these benefits and to identify any longer‑term harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it cause problems?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced eye complication of diabetes. High blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina (the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye). The eye then grows new, fragile blood‑vessel growth‑s (neovascularisation). These new vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, or cause a retinal detachment, all of which threaten vision. Because the retina is essential for seeing, any bleeding or detachment can cause sudden vision loss, require further surgery, and delay recovery.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what are the challenges with surgery?\nWhen PDR damages the retina, surgeons often perform vitrectomy. This procedure removes the gel‑like vitreous that fills the eye and clears any blood, allowing the surgeon to repair retinal tears or detachments. The abnormal new vessels are very fragile and may bleed during the operation, creating new retinal holes or causing post‑operative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH – bleeding inside the eye after surgery). These complications can worsen vision, require extra surgeries, and prolong healing.\n\nAnti‑VEGF drugs can be injected into the eye before or during surgery. They shrink and calm the abnormal vessels, making them easier to cut and reducing bleeding. We wanted to know whether using these drugs around the time of vitrectomy actually improves outcomes for patients.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether giving anti‑VEGF medicines before or during vitrectomy helps people with PDR (PDR). Specifically we asked whether this approach:\n- Improves visual sharpness six months after surgery (measured as best corrected visual acuity, BCVA – how clearly a person can see).\n- Lowers the risk of early and late POVCH (early = within 4 weeks, late = after 4 weeks).\n- Reduces the need for additional surgeries to fix bleeding or retinal detachments.\n- Decreases other surgical problems such as retinal breaks during the operation or the need for silicone oil tamponade.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy plus peri‑operative anti‑VEGF (around the time of surgery) with vitrectomy alone in people with PDR. We included studies that randomised participants to one of these two groups and reported relevant surgical outcomes. We combined results using meta‑analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence based on study methods, risk of bias and sample size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 28 trials involving 1 914 eyes that underwent pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The trials were conducted in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia and Pakistan. Participants received an anti‑VEGF injection either before or during surgery, compared with vitrectomy alone.\n\nThe evidence suggests that anti‑VEGF around the time of surgery probably improves vision six months after the operation (about 0.25 log‑MAR better, low‑certainty evidence). It probably reduces early POVCH from roughly 31 % to 12 % (moderate‑certainty evidence) and reduces late POVCH from about 23 % to 10 % (high‑certainty evidence). Anti‑VEGF probably lowers the chance of retinal breaks during surgery from 31 % to 12 % (high‑certainty evidence). We are less certain about its effect on the need for repeat surgery for bleeding or on the use of silicone oil; current data do not give a clear answer.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and many studies were small or few in number. These factors reduce certainty about the results.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
