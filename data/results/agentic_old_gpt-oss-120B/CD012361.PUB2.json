  "text": "Is dexmedetomidine (a medication that calms patients and reduces pain) effective and safe for calming and relieving pain in newborn babies (babies younger than 4 weeks) who need a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation) compared with other medicines or no treatment?  \n\nKey messages  \n- We found no eligible studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines or a dummy treatment (placebo) for newborn infants on mechanical ventilation; therefore we have no evidence about its ability to provide calmness (sedation) or pain relief (analgesia) or about possible harms such as abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension).  \n- Four clinical trials are currently recruiting. Two will compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl (a very strong pain‑relieving opioid), and the other two will compare it with morphine (another opioid) or with a combination of ketamine (a medication that can relieve pain and produce sedation) and dexmedetomidine. These studies may later give data on effectiveness and safety.  \n- Because evidence is lacking, we need well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign babies to receive either dexmedetomidine or another treatment) to determine the benefits, risks, and long‑term brain and development outcomes (neurodevelopmental outcomes) of using dexmedetomidine as a single drug for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants.  \n\nWhat health problem do newborn infants on mechanical ventilation face?  \nNewborn babies who need a breathing machine often stay in intensive‑care. While the machine helps them breathe, they can feel pain and become agitated. Doctors give medicines that provide sedation (calmness) and analgesia (pain relief). The most common drugs are opioids (pain‑relieving medicines such as morphine or fentanyl). Opioids can cause abnormally low blood pressure and affect heart function. Dexmedetomidine works by activating a specific brain protein called the alpha‑2 receptor (a type of protein on nerve cells that, when activated, slows down nerve signals, leading to sedation and lower blood pressure). It is thought to cause fewer heart‑related side effects, but it is not approved for this use in newborns.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to determine whether dexmedetomidine is effective and safe for providing sedation and analgesia to newborn infants who are receiving mechanical ventilation. We planned to compare dexmedetomidine with non‑opioid drugs, with opioid drugs, or with no drug (placebo). We looked at outcomes such as level of calmness, pain relief, time on the ventilator, need for additional medicines, abnormally low blood pressure, death (mortality), and long‑term brain development.  \n\nHow did we look for our answer?  \nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and other databases without language limits. We also screened reference lists of relevant articles. We included randomised controlled trials that enrolled neonates (babies in the first 28 days after birth) on mechanical ventilation and that compared dexmedetomidine with another analgesic or placebo and reported clinical outcomes.  \n\nHow did we analyse any data?  \nIf eligible trials had been found, we would have pooled results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis. We would have expressed binary outcomes as risk ratios and continuous outcomes as mean differences, each with 95 % confidence intervals. We would have rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE system (a method that rates how confident we are that the results are reliable).  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nOur search identified no eligible randomised controlled trials. Consequently, we have zero participants and no data on how well dexmedetomidine works, its safety, or any long‑term effects. Four trials are currently underway, but their results are not yet available. At present, we cannot say whether dexmedetomidine improves sedation or analgesia, or whether it is safe for these infants.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe cannot be confident in any conclusions because no studies met our criteria. The evidence does not cover all the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
