Leaks can happen when the bladder is squeezed (stress incontinence), when there is a sudden urge to go (urgency incontinence), or both (the leak occurs with pressure and urgency). The condition is common after childbirth or with age. It can disrupt daily activities, sleep, social life, and confidence. It also raises health‑service costs and can cause skin irritation or infections.\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and how is it usually done?  \nThe pelvic floor (muscles that support the bladder, uterus and bowel) helps keep urine in. PFMT teaches a woman to contract these muscles on purpose. The simplest form, direct PFMT, involves repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles, often taught by a physiotherapist or written guide. PFMT can vary in three ways:  \n- Type of exercise: coordinated training (whole‑body movements combined with pelvic floor squeezes) or indirect training (activities that do not involve direct pelvic squeezes, such as walking or yoga).  \n- Dose: number of repetitions, days per week, or use of a resistance device (a tool such as a vaginal cone that adds load).  \n- Delivery: where and how the training is supervised—clinic, home, individual, group, or e‑health.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare different ways of doing PFMT to see which approaches work best for improving quality of life in women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Specifically, we examined how variations in exercise type, dose, and delivery affect symptoms and daily living.\n\nHow did we do the review?  \nWe searched international databases for randomised trials that compared at least two PFMT approaches in women with urinary incontinence. We combined the results to estimate effects on quality of life and we rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system. We searched up to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe incorporated 63 randomised (including quasi‑randomised and cluster‑randomised) trials involving 4,920 women. Participants were generally mid‑age (≈45–65 years), parous (had given birth), and mainly had stress‑predominant mixed urinary incontinence. All studies included a direct PFMT arm and compared it with alternative approaches across the three domains described above.  \n\nMain results  \n- Coordinated training may slightly improve quality of life, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n- Direct PFMT alone may moderately improve quality of life compared with indirect training, yet the certainty is low.  \n- Adding indirect exercises to direct PFMT probably makes little or no difference to quality of life.  \n- Training without a resistance device may slightly improve quality of life, but the effect is very uncertain.  \n- Performing PFMT on more days each week may greatly improve quality of life, although confidence is low.  \n- Clinic‑supervised PFMT may slightly improve quality of life compared with home‑based training, but we are very uncertain about this.  \n- Individual supervision probably makes little or no difference to quality of life compared with group supervision.  \n- Clinic supervision versus e‑health supervision may make little or no difference, with very uncertain evidence.  \n- Delivering PFMT instructions through e‑health may slightly improve quality of life, but certainty remains low.  \n\nWe reported adverse events in nine trials; about 6 % of women experienced mild device‑related discomfort (e.g., vaginal discharge or spotting).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and the populations and delivery methods varied. These factors increase the risk of bias and reduce certainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe updated our previous review and included studies published up to September 2023.",
