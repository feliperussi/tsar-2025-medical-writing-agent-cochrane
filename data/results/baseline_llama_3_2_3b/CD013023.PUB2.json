Despite their importance, ACs often fail, requiring reinsertion. Dressings and securement devices maintain AC function and prevent complications such as infection.\n* We wanted to find out: which types of dressing and securement devices work best to prevent failure and complications in hospitalised people.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n* We searched for studies that compared different dressing and securement devices for the stabilisation of ACs in hospitalised people.\n* We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different dressing and securement devices for the stabilisation of ACs in hospitalised people.\n* We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.\n* We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus up to 16 May 2023.\n* We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023.\n* We included five RCTs with 1228 participants and 1228 ACs.\n* We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool.\n* We resolved disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n* All included studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains.\n* We present the following four comparisons, with the remaining comparisons reported in the main review.\n* Standard polyurethane (SPU) plus tissue adhesive (TA) compared with SPU: we are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus TA impacts rates of AC failure (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.98; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 165 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n* Bordered polyurethane (BPU) compared to SPU: we are very uncertain whether use of BPU impacts rates of AC failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.13; 1 study, 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n* SPU plus sutureless securement devices (SSD) compared to SPU: we are very uncertain whether SPU plus SSD impacts risk of AC failure compared with SPU (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.52; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n* Integrated securement dressings compared to SPU: integrated securement dressings may result in little or no difference in risk of AC failure compared with SPU (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.84; 1 study, 105 participants; low-certainty evidence).\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus TA impacts rates of AC failure.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of BPU impacts rates of AC failure.\n* We are very uncertain whether SPU plus SSD impacts risk of AC failure compared with SPU.\n* We are very uncertain whether integrated securement dressings impact risk of AC failure compared with SPU.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts CRBSI incidence rate.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of dislodgement.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts risk of occlusion.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of occlusion.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts risk of adverse events.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of adverse events.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts CRBSI incidence rate.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts CRBSI incidence rate.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts occlusion rates.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts occlusion rates.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts adverse events.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts adverse events.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts risk of AC failure.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of AC failure.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts risk of dislodgement.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of dislodgement.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts risk of occlusion.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of occlusion.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of SPU plus SSD impacts risk of adverse events.\n* We are very uncertain whether use of integrated securement dressings impacts risk of adverse events.",
