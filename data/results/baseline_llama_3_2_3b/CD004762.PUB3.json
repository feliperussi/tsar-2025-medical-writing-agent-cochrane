  "text": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of drug treatment for myotonia?**\n\nMyotonia is a condition that affects the muscles, causing stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause significant disability and morbidity. Drug treatment may help reduce myotonia, but it's not clear which treatments work best.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies on drug treatment for myotonia and included 17 randomized controlled trials involving 392 participants. We looked at the effects of two medications, mexiletine and lamotrigine, on myotonia.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nMexiletine likely reduces myotonia compared to placebo, but there may be no difference in quality of life. Lamotrigine may improve relaxation time, but its effects on quality of life are unclear. Both medications had some adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and headache.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is not very clear, and more research is needed to determine the best treatments for myotonia. The studies were small, and the results may not be generalizable to all people with myotonia.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is based on studies conducted up to 2023, but it's not clear if newer studies have been published.\n\nNote that I've tried to simplify the language and structure the summary to make it more accessible to a non-medical audience. However, please let me know if you have any further requests or if you'd like me to revise anything.",
