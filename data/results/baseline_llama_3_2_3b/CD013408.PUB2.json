  "text": "Here is the transformed Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following all guidelines:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of organised clinical services for adults with atrial fibrillation?**\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults. It's becoming more common, and its management is complex. To deliver good care, we need to know the best way to organise clinical services for people with AF. We looked at how different approaches to care work for people with AF.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 8 studies that compared organised clinical services for AF to usual care. The studies were done in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse-led multidisciplinary approach or management using mobile health (mHealth) compared to usual care. Only six out of the eight included studies could be included in the meta-analysis.\n\nOrganised AF clinical services probably reduce all-cause mortality (by 36%) compared to usual care. However, they probably make little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but they do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation. They may not reduce thromboembolic complications, such as stroke, and major cerebrovascular bleeding events.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because all the studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias rating for performance bias (blinding) in particular. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
