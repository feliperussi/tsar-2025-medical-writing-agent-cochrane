  "text": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the tool I was using earlier is not a valid one for transforming the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary.\n\nInstead, I can try to help you with the transformation manually. Here is the Plain Language Summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women?**\n\nSingle-incision sling operations are a minimally-invasive treatment option for stress urinary incontinence in women. However, the evidence is uncertain regarding their long-term effectiveness and safety.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if single-incision sling operations are effective and safe for treating urinary incontinence in women.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 62 studies with a total of 8051 women. We did not identify any studies comparing single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures. We assessed most studies as being at low or unclear risk of bias, with five studies at high risk of bias for outcome assessment.\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of single-incision sling operations?**\n\nThere may be little to no difference between single-incision slings and retropubic slings in subjective cure or improvement of incontinence at 12 months. Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings. Women with single-incision slings may have lower quality of life at 12 months compared to transobturator slings.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nLonger-term data are needed to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings. The evidence is uncertain regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes.\n\n**How accurate are single-incision sling operations?**\n\nSingle-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for subjective cure or improvement of stress urinary incontinence at 12 months. It is unclear whether single-incision slings lead to slightly more women requiring repeat continence surgery or mesh revision compared with transobturator slings.\n\nPlease note that this is a manual translation and may not be perfect.
