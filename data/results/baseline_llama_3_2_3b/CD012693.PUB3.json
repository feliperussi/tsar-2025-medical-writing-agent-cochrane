Low-certainty evidence suggests that it is unclear if ORT-based individualisation leads to an increase in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates compared to a policy of giving all women 150 IU. The confidence interval is consistent with an increase of up to around six percentage points with ORT-based dosing (e.g. from 25% to 31%) or a very small decrease (< 1%). A difference of this magnitude could be important to many women. It is unclear if this is driven by improved outcomes in a particular subgroup. Further, ORT algorithms reduced the incidence of OHSS compared to standard dosing of 150 IU. However, the size of the effect is also unclear.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is not very clear because the studies were not all the same and some were very small. We also found that the studies were not all well-designed, which makes it harder to interpret the results. Additionally, we're not sure if the findings apply to all women or just to those who are predicted to have a good or poor response to treatment.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023. However, we're not sure if there have been any new studies published since then that might change our findings.\n\nPlease note that this is a manual transformation and may not be perfect.
