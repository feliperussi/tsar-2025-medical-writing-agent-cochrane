However, the evidence is very uncertain about this outcome.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   **What is internal hernia?** Internal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. It happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weak spot in the abdominal wall.\n*   **Why is closing mesenteric defects important?** Closing mesenteric defects may help prevent internal hernia and reduce the risk of complications. However, the evidence is not yet strong enough to make a definitive recommendation.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n*   We searched for studies that compared the closure of mesenteric defects with the non-closure of defects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.\n*   We analyzed the results of the included studies and calculated the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction, postoperative overall complications, postoperative mortality, and intraoperative overall complications.\n*   We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   Closing mesenteric defects may reduce the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction within 10 years after surgery (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.42; P < 0.00001, I² = 0%).\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative overall complications (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47; P = 0.35, I² = 0%).\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative mortality (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.93; P = 0.50, I² not applicable).\n*   The closure of defects may result in little to no difference in the incidence of intraoperative overall complications (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.42; P = 0.59, I² not applicable).\n*   The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure than for those who did not have the defects closed (MD 0.27 days, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.38; P < 0.00001; I² = 93%).\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is very uncertain about the incidence of postoperative mortality, the incidence of intraoperative overall complications, and the length of hospital stay.\n*   The small number of trials limited our confidence in the evidence.\n*   Additional evidence based on trials designed to be at low risk of bias and with an adequate sample size is imperative.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The review is based on studies that were searched up to August 2024.\n*   The evidence is current as of the search date, but the review authors note that additional evidence may have been published since then.\n\n**Funding and registration:**\n\n*   This review was funded by [insert funding information].\n*   The protocol was registered in the Cochrane Library on 9 May 2023.",
