  "text": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of face-down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   Immediate face-down positioning may reduce the risk of postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared to support-the-break positioning at six months.\n*   There is no evidence that face-down positioning improves visual acuity or reduces distortion scores.\n*   Immediate face-down positioning may have little to no effect on postoperative quality of life assessment scores.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   **What is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?**\n    Macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are a common ophthalmic surgical emergency that can cause significant visual morbidity.\n*   **Why is pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade often performed?**\n    Pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving retinal detachments with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment.\n*   **What is the primary objective of this review?**\n    The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving retinal detachments.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials that compared face-down positioning with no positioning or another form of positioning following pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving retinal detachments.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe identified three randomized controlled trials that met the eligibility criteria. Two trials provided data on postoperative retinal displacement, one reported on postoperative distortion and quality of life outcomes, two on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity in logMAR, and two on postoperative ocular adverse events such as outer retinal folds.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is very low certainty due to the risk of bias and imprecision. The trials were small, and the risk of bias was low for most domains. However, the trials had limitations, such as a lack of diversity in the participant population and inadequate reporting of funding sources.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nFuture trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty. Quality of life and patient preferences should be examined in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes.",
