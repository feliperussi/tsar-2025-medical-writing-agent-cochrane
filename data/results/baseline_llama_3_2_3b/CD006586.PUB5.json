The placebo also had a significant effect.\n* COCs containing drospirenone and EE may lead to more adverse effects compared to placebo.\n* We do not know whether it works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other combined oral contraceptives that contain a different progestogen.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n**What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?**\n\nPMS is a common problem that affects many women. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS. Combined oral contraceptives (COC), which provide both progestin and oestrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms.\n\n**Why is this review important?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if COCs containing drospirenone are effective and safe for women with PMS.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared COCs containing drospirenone with placebo or with another COC for treatment of women with PMS. We included five RCTs (858 women analysed, most diagnosed with PMDD). The evidence was very low to moderate quality; the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious inconsistency and imprecision.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nCOCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve overall premenstrual symptoms. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may lead to more adverse effects compared to placebo. We are uncertain of the effect of drospirenone plus EE on premenstrual mood symptoms. COCs containing drospirenone may lead to more adverse effects in total. We do not know whether it works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other combined oral contraceptives that contain a different progestogen.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022. We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. The effects of COCs containing drospirenone may be small to moderate. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may lead to more adverse effects compared to placebo. We do not know whether it works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other combined oral contraceptives that contain a different progestogen.\n\nNote: I've followed the guidelines provided to transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary. However, please note that this is a machine-generated summary and may not be perfect. It's always best to have a human review and edit the summary to ensure accuracy and clarity.",
