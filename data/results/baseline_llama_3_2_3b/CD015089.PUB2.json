  "text": "Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nHere is the transformed Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following all guidelines above:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of using the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) examination to diagnose central causes of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS)?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   The HINTS examination is a useful tool for diagnosing central causes of AVS, but its accuracy can vary depending on the provider and the type of examination used.\n*   The HINTS Plus examination, which includes an additional assessment of auditory function, may be more accurate than the standard HINTS examination, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n*   The HINTS examination is not a perfect test, and its results should be interpreted with caution. If you have concerns about your symptoms, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n*   **What is acute vestibular syndrome (AVS)?** AVS is a type of dizziness that can be caused by a variety of factors, including peripheral or central causes. It's a common reason for people to seek medical care.\n*   **Why is it important to determine the cause of AVS?** The intervention and outcomes differ if AVS is caused by a peripheral or central cause. Knowing the cause can help healthcare providers make more accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\n*   We wanted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying central causes of AVS.\n*   We also wanted to evaluate the role of video-assistance and specific subgroups in the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n*   We included 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants (981 women and 1043 men) with a mean age of 60 years.\n*   The clinical HINTS examination was 94.0% sensitive and 86.9% specific for diagnosing central causes of AVS.\n*   The video-assisted HINTS examination was 85.0% to 100% sensitive and 38.9% to 100% specific for diagnosing central causes of AVS.\n*   The clinical HINTS Plus examination was 95.3% sensitive and 72.9% specific for diagnosing central causes of AVS.\n*   The video-assisted HINTS Plus examination was 85.0% to 93.8% sensitive and 28.6% to 38.9% specific for diagnosing central causes of AVS.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence was of low certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision.\n*   The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations had good sensitivity and reasonable specificity for diagnosing central causes of AVS in the emergency department when performed by trained clinicians.\n*   There were limited data for the role of video-assistance or specific subgroups.\n*   Future research should include more high-quality studies of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examination, assessment of inter-rater reliability across users, accuracy across different providers, specialties, and experience, and direct comparison with no HINTS or MRI to assess the effect on clinical care.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n*   The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n*   This review updates our previous review.\n*   The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
