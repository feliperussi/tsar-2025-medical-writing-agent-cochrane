It can affect their development, health, and well-being. Interventions that aim to prevent obesity involve behavioural change strategies that promote healthy eating or \"activity\" levels (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and/or sleep) or both.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out: which types of interventions work best to prevent obesity in children; the effects of dietary and/or activity interventions on changes in BMI, zBMI score, and serious adverse events.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared interventions to prevent obesity in children with no intervention, usual care, or with another eligible intervention. We included studies that measured outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks post baseline.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThis review includes 172 studies (189,707 participants). The main setting for intervention delivery was schools (111 studies), followed by the community (15 studies), the home (eight studies) and a clinical setting (seven studies). Eighty-six interventions were implemented for less than nine months.\n\n**Dietary interventions versus control:**\n\nDietary interventions, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI at short-term follow-up and at medium-term follow-up. Dietary interventions, compared with control, probably have little to no effect on BMI at long-term follow-up.\n\n**Activity interventions versus control:**\n\nActivity interventions, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI and zBMI at short-term or long-term follow-up. Activity interventions likely result in a slight reduction of BMI and zBMI at medium-term follow-up.\n\n**Dietary and activity interventions versus control:**\n\nDietary and activity interventions, compared with control, may result in a slight reduction in BMI and zBMI at short-term follow-up and likely result in a reduction of BMI and zBMI at medium-term follow-up.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe body of evidence in this review demonstrates that a range of school-based \"activity\" interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. Limited evidence of low quality was identified on the effect of dietary and/or activity interventions on severe adverse events and health inequalities.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\nPlease note that I have followed the Cochrane guidelines to transform the abstract into a Plain Language Summary. However, please review the summary to ensure its accuracy and completeness.",
