  "text": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain control in women with primary dysmenorrhoea?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment, but the evidence is low certainty due to the risk of bias.\n* Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment, but the evidence is low certainty due to the risk of bias.\n* It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared with low-frequency TENS.\n* High-frequency TENS may have a similar effect on pain relief compared to other treatments like acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy.\n* Low-frequency TENS may have a similar effect on pain relief compared to acetaminophen.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n**What is primary dysmenorrhoea?**\n\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea is a type of menstrual pain or cramps that some women experience during their periods. It can be a painful and uncomfortable symptom for many women.\n\n**Why is this review important?**\n\nThis review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain control in women with primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We included 20 randomized controlled trials involving 585 women with high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo or no treatment, or other treatment.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nHigh-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment. However, the evidence is low certainty due to the risk of bias. It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared with low-frequency TENS. High-frequency TENS may have a similar effect on pain relief compared to other treatments like acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is low certainty due to the risk of bias. Future RCTs should focus more on secondary outcomes of this review and should be designed to ensure a low risk of bias.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date as of April 2024.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the original abstract, and some details may have been lost in the translation process.",
