  "text": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding after vascular surgery?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Using sealants to stop bleeding after vascular surgery may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding and the rate of bleeding failure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n* There may be no differences in intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room for bleeding complications.\n* Deaths and quality of life could not be analyzed.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n**What is vascular surgery and why is it necessary?**\n\nVascular surgery is a type of surgery that involves repairing or replacing blood vessels, such as arteries and veins, that are damaged or diseased. This type of surgery is necessary to prevent complications, such as bleeding, organ damage, or even death.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding after vascular surgery.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the use of sealants with standard care controls, such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. We included 24 randomized controlled trials that involved a total of 2376 participants.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nOur analysis showed that sealant use may reduce the time to hemostasis and the rate of hemostatic intervention failure, although the evidence is very uncertain. We did not detect any clear differences between the sealant and control groups for intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room for bleeding complications.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain due to the risk of bias in all studies, inconsistency, imprecision, and possible publication bias. Future trials are needed to provide unbiased data and address other considerations, such as cost-effectiveness and adverse events with sealant use.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe latest search date was 6 March 2023. Our review is based on the evidence available up to that date.\n\nPlease note that this is a transformed version of the original abstract, and it may not be a perfect translation.
