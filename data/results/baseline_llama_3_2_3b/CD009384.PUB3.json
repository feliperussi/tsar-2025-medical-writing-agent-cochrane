  "text": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided. Here is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of zinc supplementation for preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Zinc supplementation might help prevent episodes of diarrhea and improve growth slightly, particularly in children aged 6 months to 12 years of age.\n* The benefits of preventive zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n* We could not find any evidence that zinc supplementation reduces the risk of mortality due to all-cause diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), or malaria.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n* What is zinc deficiency?\nZinc deficiency is a significant risk factor for morbidity, mortality, and linear growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n* Why is preventive zinc supplementation important?\nThe effectiveness of preventive zinc supplementation in reducing prevalence of zinc deficiency needs to be assessed.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out: which types of zinc supplementation work best to prevent mortality and morbidity, and to promote growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and one trials register up to February 2022, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We included 16 new studies in this review, resulting in a total of 96 RCTs with 219,584 eligible participants.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n* We found little to no difference in all-cause mortality with preventive zinc supplementation compared to no zinc.\n* We found that preventive zinc supplementation likely reduces the incidence of all-cause diarrhea but results in little to no difference in morbidity due to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) compared to no zinc.\n* We found that preventive zinc supplementation likely leads to a slight increase in height.\n* We found that zinc supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and the risk of bias was a concern. We could not rule out a possibility of increased risk of mortality due to all-cause diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), or malaria.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nNote: I've followed the guidelines provided to transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary. However, please note that this is a machine-generated summary and may not be perfect. It's always best to have a human reviewer check the summary for accuracy and clarity.",
