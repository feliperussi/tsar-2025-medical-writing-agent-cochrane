However, they may not improve their esophagus as much as some people might hope. Corticosteroids may also reduce the number of people who have to stop taking their medication because of side effects.\n* Biologics may help people with eosinophilic esophagitis by reducing inflammation in their esophagus. However, they may not improve their symptoms as much as some people might hope. Biologics may also increase the risk of some side effects, but it's not clear how much this is a problem for most people.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n**What is eosinophilic esophagitis?**\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the esophagus. It's a bit like having a bad cold that won't go away, but it's not caused by a virus. Instead, it's caused by an overactive immune system that reacts to certain foods or other triggers.\n\n**What do we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out which treatments work best for people with EoE. We looked at two main treatments: corticosteroids and biologics. We wanted to see if these treatments could help people with EoE by improving their symptoms, reducing inflammation in their esophagus, and making it easier for them to swallow.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared corticosteroids and biologics to placebo (a dummy treatment). We looked at 41 studies that involved 3253 people with EoE. We evaluated the quality of the studies and found that most of them were of moderate or low certainty.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nCorticosteroids may lead to slightly better clinical improvement (20% higher) and may lead to slightly better clinical improvement, measured continuously (SMD 0.51). Corticosteroids lead to a large histological improvement (63% higher) and may lead to histological improvement, measured continuously (SMD 1.42). Corticosteroids may or may not increase endoscopic improvement (depending on whether the outcome is measured dichotomously or continuously). Withdrawals due to adverse events may occur less frequently when corticosteroids are compared to placebo.\n\nBiologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome and may lead to an increase in clinical symptom improvement (as a continuous outcome). Biologics lead to a large increase in histological improvement when reported as a dichotomous outcome, but this is uncertain when reported as a continuous outcome. Biologics may not increase endoscopic improvement (dichotomous outcome), but this is uncertain when measured as a continuous outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events as a dichotomous outcome may occur as frequently when biologics are compared to placebo.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We also have low certainty because some studies had a high risk of bias and some had a high risk of imprecision.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
