  "text": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the tool I was using earlier is not a valid Plain Language Summary (PLS) generator.\n\nInstead, I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually. Please provide me with the abstract, and I will assist you in rewriting it in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to readers without medical knowledge.\n\nHere is the rewritten PLS:\n\n**Is routine use of bronchoscopy for diagnosing and managing lung infections in children with cystic fibrosis effective?**\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of using bronchoscopy for lung infections in children with cystic fibrosis?**\n\nBronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy may make little or no difference in lung function z scores after two years or at five years in children with cystic fibrosis. There is probably no difference in average cost of care per participant between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care at five years. No evidence is available for adults.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nFuture research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: the effects of different types of antimicrobial therapy, the impact of BAL on the development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the cost-effectiveness of BAL.\n\n**How were the studies done?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the outcomes of antimicrobial therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy versus those guided by any other type of sampling. We included two studies in this updated review.\n\n**What were the results?**\n\nThe certainty of the evidence for the key outcomes was low, other than for high-resolution computed tomography scoring and cost-of-care analysis, which we graded as moderate certainty. The studies reported similar outcomes, but meta-analysis was not possible due to different ways of measuring the outcomes and different indications for the use of BAL.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe risk of bias for allocation concealment and selective reporting was unclear in the smaller study. The larger study found little or no difference between groups in absolute FEV1 z score or forced vital capacity (FVC) at five years. The larger study found little or no difference in nutritional parameters or in the number of positive isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per year. The larger study found no difference in health-related quality of life between BAL-guided therapy and standard care at either two or five years. The larger study found no difference in the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per year. The larger study found no difference in the eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment. The larger study found no difference in the number of pulmonary exacerbations. The larger study found no difference in the number of hospitalizations per year. The larger study found no difference in average cost of care per participant at five years. The larger study found no difference in chest scores assessed by computed tomography scan at either two or five years. The larger study found no difference in the change from baseline in lung clearance index (LCI) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at two years. The larger study found no difference in the change from baseline in LCI and FEV1 at five years.\n\nPlease let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further assistance.",
