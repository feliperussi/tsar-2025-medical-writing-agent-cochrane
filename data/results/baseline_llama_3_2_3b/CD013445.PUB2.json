  "text": "Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nNow, I will transform the provided Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following Cochrane guidelines.\n\n**Plain Language Summary Title**\n**What are the benefits and risks of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating kidney stones in adults?**\n\n**Key Messages**\n\n* PCNL may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions, but probably has little or no effect on major complications.\n* PCNL may have little or no effect on ureteral stricture rates, but may increase length of hospital stay.\n* There is no evidence on unplanned medical visits or participant quality of life.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n**What is kidney stone treatment?**\nKidney stones can be a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. Depending on size, location, composition, and other patient factors, treatment can involve observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out: which treatment works best for treating kidney stones in adults: PCNL or RIRS?\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults with kidney stones. We included 42 trials assessing the effects of PCNL versus RIRS in 4571 randomized participants.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found that PCNL compared with RIRS may improve stone-free rates and may reduce the need for secondary interventions, but probably has little or no effect on major complications. PCNL compared with RIRS may have little or no effect on ureteral stricture rates, but may increase length of hospital stay. There is no evidence on unplanned medical visits or participant quality of life.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the included trials had many shortcomings, such as small sample sizes, lack of funding information, and inadequate reporting. The evidence for most outcomes was of low certainty.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\n**How accurate are the results?**\nThe results are based on a large body of evidence from 42 trials, but the evidence for most outcomes was of low certainty due to the shortcomings of the included trials.",
