  "text": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke?**\n\nDepression is a common problem after stroke that can affect a person's recovery. We looked at different treatments to see if they can help reduce depression in people who have had a stroke. We found that some treatments may help, but others may not. We also found that some treatments can cause side effects. We need more research to determine the best treatment for depression after stroke.\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Pharmacological interventions may help reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression, but they may also cause more adverse events related to the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.\n* Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression.\n* Psychological therapy may help reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n* We need more research to determine the best treatment for depression after stroke.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\nDepression is a common problem after stroke that can affect a person's recovery. We looked at different treatments to see if they can help reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies on different treatments for depression after stroke and combined the results. We found 65 studies that included 5831 people. We looked at the benefits and risks of each treatment and found that pharmacological interventions may help reduce depression, but can also cause side effects. Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on depression. Psychological therapy may help reduce depression, but more research is needed. We need more research to determine the best treatment for depression after stroke.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found that pharmacological interventions may help reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression, but they may also cause more adverse events related to the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression. Psychological therapy may help reduce the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression, but more research is needed to confirm this. Combination therapy resulted in no deaths. Pharmacological intervention was associated with adverse events related to the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We also have low certainty in the evidence because of the risk of bias and imprecision. More research is needed to confirm our findings.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nDepression is a common problem after stroke that can affect a person's recovery.
