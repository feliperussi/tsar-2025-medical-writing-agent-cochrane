  "text": "I can help you transform the Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) following the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the transformed PLS:\n\n**Is early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation better for patients?**\n\n**What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)? A UTI is an infection of the urinary system. It can be caused by bacteria. Antibiotic treatment is only useful for UTIs caused by bacteria.**\n\n**What is kidney transplantation and why is it important? Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter is inserted into the bladder to allow it to drain. This reduces tension on the cysto-ureteric anastomosis and promotes healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients. The longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI).**\n\n**What do we want to find out? We wanted to compare patients who had their catheter removed < 5 days post-transplant surgery to those patients who had their catheter removed > 5 days following their kidney transplant.**\n\n**What did we find? Two studies were included in our analysis. One study found that it is uncertain whether early versus late removal of the urinary catheter made any difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Data on other outcomes, such as the incidence of UTI and the incidence of major urological complications, were lacking. Furthermore, the follow-up of patients across the studies was short, with no patients being followed beyond one month.**\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence? The included studies were generally of poor quality and had a short follow-up period. A high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant.**\n\n**How up to date is this evidence? The literature search was up to date to 13 April 2023.**\n\n**What does this mean for patients? The current evidence is insufficient to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant. Patients should be aware that the optimal timing of catheter removal after kidney transplantation is still unknown and requires further research.**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* The removal of a urinary catheter before five days (120 hours) may not make a difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients following a kidney transplant.\n* There is insufficient evidence to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant.\n* A high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant.\n\n**Main Results:**\n\n* It is uncertain whether early versus late removal of the urinary catheter made any difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n* Data on other outcomes, such as the incidence of UTI and the incidence of major urological complications, were lacking.\n* Furthermore, the follow-up of patients across the studies was short, with no patients being followed beyond one month.\n\n**Study Characteristics:**\n\n* Two studies were included in our analysis.\n* One study comprised a full-text article, and the other was a conference abstract with very limited information.\n* The risk of bias in the included studies was generally either high or unclear.\n* The studies were conducted in different countries and had varying follow-up periods.\n* The studies included a total of 197 patients.\n* The studies were funded by different organizations.\n\n**Title:**\n\nIs early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation better for patients?\n\n**Treatment Options:**\n\n* Removal of urinary catheter before five days (120 hours) may not make a difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients following a kidney transplant.\n* There is insufficient evidence to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant.\n* A high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence:**\n\n* The included studies were generally of poor quality and had a short follow-up period.\n* A high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant.\n\n**What we did:**\n\n* We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 April 2023.\n* We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-RCTs comparing timing of catheter removal post-transplantation.\n* We assessed the quality of the included studies using the risk of bias tool.\n* We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria.\n* We calculated the relative risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria and expressed the results as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.\n* We assessed the confidence in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\n\n**What we found:**\n\n* Two studies were included in our analysis.\n* One study found that it is uncertain whether early versus late removal of the urinary catheter made any difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.\n* Data on other outcomes, such as the incidence of UTI and the incidence of major urological complications, were lacking.\n* Furthermore, the follow-up of patients across the studies was short, with no patients being followed beyond one month.",
