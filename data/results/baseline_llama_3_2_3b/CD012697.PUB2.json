  "text": "## Plain Language Summary\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n*   We found that magnetic seizure therapy (MST) may not be better than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating schizophrenia.\n*   MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration, but also may improve more cognitive function.\n*   There may be no difference between MST and ECT in terms of leaving the study early due to any reason, due to adverse effects, or due to inefficacy.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out: which treatments work best to help people with schizophrenia.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared MST alone or plus standard care with ECT or any other interventions for people with schizophrenia.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found one four-week study with 79 adults in acute schizophrenia, comparing MST plus standard care to ECT plus standard care. We rated the overall risk of bias as high due to high risk of bias in the domains of selective reporting and other biases (early termination and baseline imbalance) and unclear risk of bias in the domain of blinding of participants and personnel.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We were not sure these comparable or favourable effects of MST over ECT were its true effects.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nWell-designed RCTs are warranted to answer the question.",
