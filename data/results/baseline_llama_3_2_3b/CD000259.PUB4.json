  "text": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the provided tool is not a suitable replacement for the Cochrane abstract transformation.\n\nInstead, I can provide a rewritten version of the Cochrane abstract in Plain Language Summary (PLS) format, following the guidelines and principles outlined earlier. Please find the rewritten summary below:\n\n**What are the effects of audit and feedback on healthcare professionals?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* Audit and feedback (A&F) can improve healthcare professionals' practice, but effects vary in size.\n* A&F is most often delivered along with co-interventions which can contribute additive effects.\n* A&F may be most effective when designed to help recipients prioritise and take action on high-priority clinical issues and with the following characteristics:\n\t1. targets important performance metrics where health professionals have substantial room for improvement (audit).\n\t2. measures the individual recipient's practice, rather than their team or organisation (audit).\n\t3. involves a local champion with an existing relationship with the recipient (feedback).\n\t4. includes multiple, interactive modalities such as verbal and written (feedback).\n\t5. compares performance to top peers or a benchmark (feedback).\n\t6. facilitates engagement with the feedback (action).\n\t7. features an actionable plan with specific advice for improvement (action).\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of A&F on healthcare professionals' practice. We included 292 studies with 678 arms, and found that A&F can improve practice, but effects vary in size. We also identified the characteristics of A&F that are most effective.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nSynthesis of 558 dichotomous outcomes measuring professional practices from 177 studies testing A&F versus control revealed a median absolute improvement in desired practice of 2.7%, with an IQR of 0.0 to 8.6. Meta-analyses of these studies, accounting for multiple outcomes from the same study and weighting by effective sample size accounting for clustering, found a mean absolute increase in desired practice of 6.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1 to 8.2; moderate-certainty evidence) and an OR of 1.47 (95% CI 1.31 to 1.64; moderate-certainty evidence).\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2020.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\nAudit and feedback (A&F) is a widely used strategy to improve professional practice. This is supported by prior Cochrane reviews and behavioural theories describing how healthcare professionals are prompted to modify their practice when given data showing that their clinical practice is inconsistent with a desirable target. Yet there remains uncertainty regarding the effects of A&F on improving healthcare practice and the characteristics of A&F that lead to a greater impact.\n\nWe wanted to assess the effects of A&F on the practice of healthcare professionals and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of A&F.\n\n**Background**\n\nAudit and feedback (A&F) is a widely used strategy to improve professional practice. This is supported by prior Cochrane reviews and behavioural theories describing how healthcare professionals are prompted to modify their practice when given data showing that their clinical practice is inconsistent with a desirable target. Yet there remains uncertainty regarding the effects of A&F on improving healthcare practice and the characteristics of A&F that lead to a greater impact.\n\n**Study characteristics**\n\nWe included 292 studies with 678 arms, and found that A&F can improve practice, but effects vary in size. We also identified the characteristics of A&F that are most effective. Most studies featured multifaceted interventions: the most common co-interventions were clinician education (377 study arms, 56%) and reminders (100 study arms, 15%). Forty-eight unique behaviour change techniques were identified within the study arms (mean 5.2, standard deviation 2.8, range 1 to 29).",
