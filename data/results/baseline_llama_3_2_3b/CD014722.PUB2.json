The studies were conducted in different countries and settings. The interventions were universal prevention/promotion, selective, and indicated prevention.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is not always clear due to the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity. A supportive network of infrastructure and research would enhance and reinforce this delivery modality across low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nFuture research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as:\n\n*   Task-shifting interventions\n*   Infrastructure and research support\n*   Universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions\n*   Effects on resource use and costs\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPrimary-level and community worker interventions may improve mental health outcomes, but the evidence is not always clear. A supportive network of infrastructure and research would enhance and reinforce this delivery modality across low- and middle-income countries.",
