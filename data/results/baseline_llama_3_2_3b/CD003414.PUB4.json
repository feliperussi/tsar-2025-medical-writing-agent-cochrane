  "text": "I can help you transform the abstract into a Plain Language Summary (PLS) manually.\n\nHere is the transformed summary:\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer (FET) in women trying to get pregnant?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n\n* We compared the effectiveness and safety of natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) FET, and ovulation induction FET in women trying to get pregnant.\n* The evidence was often of low certainty, and the confidence intervals were wide, making it unclear whether one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another.\n* We found that the type of cycle regimen used may not make a big difference in live birth rates, miscarriage rates, or multiple pregnancy rates.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims:**\n\n* What is frozen embryo transfer (FET)?\n* Why is FET used to help women get pregnant?\n* What are the different types of FET cycles?\n* What do we want to find out about the effectiveness and safety of different FET cycle regimens?\n\n**What did we do?**\n\n* We searched for studies that compared different FET cycle regimens.\n* We combined the results of the studies and evaluated the evidence.\n* We rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n* We included 32 studies that compared different FET cycle regimens in 6352 women.\n* The certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low due to limitations such as failure to report important clinical outcomes, poor reporting of study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates.\n* We found that the type of FET cycle regimen used may not make a big difference in live birth rates, miscarriage rates, or multiple pregnancy rates.\n* We are uncertain whether one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another in preparation for FET in subfertile women.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n* The evidence was often of low certainty due to limitations such as failure to report important clinical outcomes, poor reporting of study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates.\n* The confidence intervals were wide, making it unclear whether one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n* The latest search date was December 2022.\n* The evidence is up to date, but the certainty of the evidence is low due to limitations.\n\nNote that this is a manual transformation, and the output may not be as polished as a tool-generated summary. However, it should give you an idea of how to transform the abstract into a Plain Language Summary.",
