It is thought to reduce the risk of postoperative complications, such as abscesses and infections. However, the routine use of abdominal drainage to prevent intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is controversial.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out: which types of abdominal drainage work best to prevent intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis; the best ways to give abdominal drainage; and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days, wound infection at 30 days, and morbidity at 30 days in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 2.12; 7 studies, 671 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), wound infection at 30 days (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.45; 7 studies, 696 participants), and morbidity at 30 days (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.14 to 24.50; 2 studies, 124 participants) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Approximately 113 (57 to 221 participants) out of 1000 participants in the drainage group developed intraperitoneal abscess, compared with 104 out of 1000 participants in the no‐drainage group. There were seven deaths in the drainage group (N = 291) compared with one in the no‐drainage group (N = 290); abdominal drainage probably increases the risk of 30‐day mortality (Peto odds ratio 4.88, 95% CI 1.18 to 20.09; 6 studies, 581 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay by 1.58 days (95% CI 0.86 to 2.31; 5 studies, 516 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**What should happen next?**\n\nLarger studies are needed to more reliably determine the effects of drainage on mortality outcomes. The increased risk of mortality with drainage comes from eight deaths observed in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Further research is needed to clarify the role of abdominal drainage in the management of complicated appendicitis.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, open drain versus closed drain, and early versus late drain removal in people with complicated appendicitis. We found eight studies that included a total of 739 participants. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each outcome and found that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days, wound infection at 30 days, and morbidity at 30 days in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 2.12; 7 studies, 671 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), wound infection at 30 days (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.45; 7 studies, 696 participants), and morbidity at 30 days (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.14 to 24.50; 2 studies, 124 participants) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Approximately 113 (57 to 221 participants) out of 1000 participants in the drainage group developed intraperitoneal abscess, compared with 104 out of 1000 participants in the no‐drainage group. There were seven deaths in the drainage group (N = 291) compared with one in the no‐drainage group (N = 290); abdominal drainage probably increases the risk of 30‐day mortality (Peto odds ratio 4.88, 95% CI 1.18 to 20.09; 6 studies, 581 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay by 1.58 days (95% CI 0.86 to 2.31; 5 studies, 516 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**What are the implications of our findings?**\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days, wound infection at 30 days, and morbidity at 30 days in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, but the evidence is very uncertain. Consequently, there is no evidence for any clinical improvement with the use of abdominal drainage in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The increased risk of mortality with drainage comes from eight deaths observed in paediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Larger studies are needed to more reliably determine the effects of drainage on mortality outcomes.",
