The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing, and the mainstay of treatment has been behavioural interventions to support habit cessation.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to find out which interventions work best to manage OSF. They searched for studies that compared different interventions, such as systemic, locally delivered or topical drugs, surgical procedures, physiotherapy, ultrasound, or alternative therapies, to placebo or each other.\n\n### What did we do? \nWe searched for studies that compared different interventions for managing OSF and summarized their results. We also evaluated the quality of the evidence to determine how confident we can be in the findings.\n\n### What did we find? \nThe review included 30 studies with 2176 participants. The authors found that antioxidants may increase mouth opening and reduce burning sensation, but the evidence was not strong. They also found that pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. However, the evidence for other interventions was very uncertain.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had methodological limitations. The evidence was very uncertain for all other interventions compared to placebo or no active treatment.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence? \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
