However, we are not entirely sure about the safety and tolerability of different types of NRT because the evidence is limited.\n- Higher-dose nicotine patches may be more effective than lower-dose patches, but we need more research to confirm this because the current evidence is not strong enough.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates, but we need further research to make sure this is true because the evidence we have now is not certain.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy? \nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment to help people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes, which helps to ease the transition from smoking to not smoking. NRT comes in different forms, such as patches, gum, lozenges, and inhalers.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nThe goal of this review is to find out if different forms, doses, and durations of NRT are effective and safe for achieving long-term smoking cessation. We wanted to know which types of NRT work best to help people quit smoking and if there are any differences in how well they work.\n\n### How is smoking cessation treated?\nSmoking cessation can be treated with various methods, including NRT, prescription medicines, and behavioral support. NRT is one of the most common treatments used to help people quit smoking.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different types of NRT and found 68 studies with 43,327 participants. We compared and summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that using a combination of fast-acting NRT and a nicotine patch is more effective than using a single form of NRT. There is also evidence that higher-dose nicotine patches may be more effective than lower-dose patches. Using NRT before quitting smoking may also improve quit rates. However, the evidence for the safety and tolerability of different types of NRT is limited.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for the safety and tolerability of different types of NRT because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We are moderately confident in the evidence for the effectiveness of combination NRT and higher-dose nicotine patches, but we need more research to confirm these findings.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
