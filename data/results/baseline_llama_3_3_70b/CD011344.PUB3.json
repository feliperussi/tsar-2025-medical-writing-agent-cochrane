It involves administering local anesthetics into the epidural space, which helps block pain in the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum. Sometimes, epidural opioids are also given to improve pain relief. There are different ways to give epidural medications, including basal infusion, where medications are given continuously, and automated mandatory bolus, where medications are given at set time intervals. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia allows patients to give themselves extra doses of medication when needed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to know which method of delivering epidural medications, automated mandatory bolus or basal infusion, works better for maintaining pain relief during labor. We looked at how often women experienced breakthrough pain, had caesarean deliveries, instrumental deliveries, and how long labor lasted. We also considered how much local anesthetic was used and how satisfied women were with their pain relief.\n\n### What did we do? \nWe searched for studies that compared automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia in women at term. We combined and summarized the results of these studies and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find? \nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in different countries and used various techniques to initiate epidural analgesia. Our results showed that automated mandatory bolus was associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and lower hourly local anesthetic consumption compared to basal infusion. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labor analgesia, and Apgar scores.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence due to the risk of bias and imprecision in some studies. This means that while our findings suggest automated mandatory bolus may have some benefits over basal infusion, we are not entirely sure of the results because of limitations in the studies we looked at.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
