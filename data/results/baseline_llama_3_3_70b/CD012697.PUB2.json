Is magnetic seizure therapy better than electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?\n\n### Key Messages\n- We are not sure if magnetic seizure therapy is effective for people with schizophrenia because there is very little evidence. The one study we found had some flaws, and we cannot be certain about its findings.\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer side effects, such as memory problems and cognitive decline, compared to electroconvulsive therapy, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- More research is needed to determine if magnetic seizure therapy is a good treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially to understand its benefits and risks better.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is schizophrenia? \nSchizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that affects how people think, feel, and behave. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking, which can be very distressing and disrupt daily life. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond well to antipsychotic medicines, which are the main treatment for this condition. Therefore, there is a need to find other effective treatments.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is effective and safe for people with schizophrenia. MST is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been explored as a potential treatment for various mental health conditions. We were interested in comparing MST to other treatments, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), to see if it offers any benefits.\n\n### How is schizophrenia treated?\nSchizophrenia is typically treated with antipsychotic medicines, which can help reduce symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. However, these medicines do not work for everyone, and some people may experience significant side effects. Other treatments, like psychotherapy and social support, can also be helpful. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used for people with severe schizophrenia who have not responded to other treatments.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared MST to other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We looked at various databases and registers to find relevant studies. We then carefully selected studies that met our criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found one study that compared MST to ECT in 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks. The results suggested that MST may not be more effective than ECT in improving symptoms of schizophrenia. However, MST might cause fewer side effects, such as memory problems and cognitive decline, but we are very uncertain about this. The study had some flaws, and because there is only one study, we cannot be confident in these findings.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study we found had some significant flaws, including a high risk of bias. This means that the results might be influenced by factors other than the treatments being compared. Additionally, there is only one study, which is not enough to make a conclusion about the effectiveness and safety of MST for people with schizophrenia.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022. This means that our search for studies included all relevant research up to that point. However, since then, new studies might have been published, which could change our understanding of MST for schizophrenia.",
