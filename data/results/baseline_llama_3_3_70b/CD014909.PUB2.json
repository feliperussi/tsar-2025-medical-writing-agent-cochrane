This type of surgery can have serious complications, such as infections at the surgical site or leaks from the connections made during surgery, which can lead to longer recovery times and worse long-term health.\n\n### Why is bowel preparation used before surgery?\nBowel preparation is used to clean out the colon and reduce the number of bacteria in the bowel before surgery. This can be done mechanically, by using medicines to empty the bowel, or with oral antibiotics, which are medicines taken by mouth to reduce bacterial growth. The goal is to reduce the risk of complications during and after surgery.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a combination of mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation before elective colorectal surgery is better than using mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all in preventing complications such as surgical site infections and anastomotic leakages.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different methods of bowel preparation before elective colorectal surgery. We looked at the results of these studies to see if one method was safer or more effective than the others.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included over 5,000 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. Most of these studies compared the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with mechanical bowel preparation alone. The evidence suggested that using combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may reduce the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakages compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone. However, there was not enough good-quality evidence to compare the effectiveness of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakages compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone. However, our confidence in the evidence is lower when comparing combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation, mainly because there were fewer studies and the studies had limitations that could affect the results.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021. This review updates our previous review. \n\nNote: The provided response is a direct transformation of the given Cochrane abstract into a Plain Language Summary, following the specified guidelines and structure.
