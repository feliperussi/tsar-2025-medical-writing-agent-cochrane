It can be caused by genetic disorders such as myotonic dystrophy. The main goal of this review is to find out which drug treatments work best to reduce myotonia and improve quality of life for people with this condition.\n\n### Key Messages\n- We found that mexiletine, a drug that blocks sodium channels, may help reduce myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia. However, we are not confident in the evidence because the studies were small and had some biases.\n- Lamotrigine, another drug, may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but again, the evidence is not strong.\n- We need more research to find out which treatments work best for people with myotonia and to develop new treatments for those who do not respond to current therapies.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is myotonia? Myotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, which can cause stiffness, cramps, and pain. It can be caused by genetic disorders such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder causing myotonia as well as progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations, such as arrhythmias and cataracts. Non-dystrophic myotonia is a genetic muscle channelopathy predominantly causing myotonia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which drug treatments work best to reduce myotonia and improve quality of life for people with this condition. We looked at studies that compared different drug treatments to placebo or no treatment. The studies included people with myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different drug treatments to placebo or no treatment. We looked at 17 studies that included people with myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. We evaluated the evidence to see which treatments work best.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that mexiletine, a drug that blocks sodium channels, may help reduce myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia. However, we are not confident in the evidence because the studies were small and had some biases. We also found that lamotrigine, another drug, may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but again, the evidence is not strong. Other medications, such as phenytoin and imipramine, did not show clear benefits.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had some biases. The studies were not well-designed, and the results may not be reliable. We need more research to find out which treatments work best for people with myotonia and to develop new treatments for those who do not respond to current therapies.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
