People with heart failure often have a poor quality of life and are at risk of being hospitalized or dying.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, which includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling, can help improve the health and well-being of adults with heart failure. We compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual medical care, which does not include exercise, to see if it makes a difference in terms of reducing hospital admissions, improving quality of life, and reducing the risk of death.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual medical care for adults with heart failure. We found 60 studies that included over 8,700 people with heart failure. We looked at the results of these studies to see if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation made a difference in terms of hospital admissions, quality of life, and death.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life for adults with heart failure. However, we are not sure if it reduces the risk of death. The benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be consistent across different types of programs, such as center-based or home-based, and for people with different types of heart failure.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have some confidence in the evidence that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduces hospital admissions and improves quality of life, but we are less confident about its effect on death. This is because some of the studies were small or did not provide enough information, which makes it harder to be sure about the results.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021. This review updates our previous review. \n\nNote: The provided response is a Plain Language Summary of the given Cochrane abstract, following the specified guidelines and structure. It aims to make the information accessible to readers without medical knowledge, using simple language and avoiding technical jargon.",
