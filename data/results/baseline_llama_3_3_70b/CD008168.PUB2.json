However, it is uncertain whether either treatment reduces the risk of brain damage caused by high bilirubin levels because the evidence is of very low certainty.\n- It is also unclear whether one treatment is better than the other in terms of treatment failure or infant mortality, as the evidence is of very low certainty for these outcomes.\n- Future research should focus on comparing intermittent and continuous phototherapy in both preterm and term infants, and should investigate important safety outcomes.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims:\nWhat is neonatal jaundice and why is it a problem? Neonatal jaundice is a common condition in newborn babies, where a yellow substance called bilirubin builds up in the blood. If left untreated, high levels of bilirubin can cause brain damage. Phototherapy, which involves shining a special light on the baby, is a widely accepted treatment for neonatal jaundice.\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of intermittent phototherapy (where the light is shone for periods of time, with breaks in between) with continuous phototherapy (where the light is shone all the time).\n\nWhat did we do? We searched for studies that compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy in jaundiced newborns. We found 12 studies that involved over 1600 babies.\n\nWhat did we find? The studies showed that there was little difference between intermittent and continuous phototherapy in terms of how quickly bilirubin levels decreased. However, one study found that continuous phototherapy may be more effective in preterm babies. We also found that intermittent phototherapy was associated with a decrease in the total number of hours of phototherapy exposure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and not well-designed, and because there were differences between the studies. It is uncertain whether either intermittent or continuous phototherapy reduces the risk of brain damage caused by high bilirubin levels.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to January 2022.",
