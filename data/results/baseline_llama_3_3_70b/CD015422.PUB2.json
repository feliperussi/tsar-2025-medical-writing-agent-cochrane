It's a major problem in many parts of the world, causing illness and death. Current methods to control malaria, such as sleeping under insecticide-treated nets and spraying homes with insecticides, are helpful but have limitations. They mainly protect people when they are indoors, and there's a need for additional methods to prevent malaria, especially for people who are at high risk, like refugees or those who work outdoors.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if using topical repellents (applied to the skin) could help prevent malaria in people living in areas where malaria is common. We also wanted to find out if these repellents are safe to use.\n\n## How is malaria typically prevented?\nMalaria prevention often involves using insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and wearing protective clothing. However, these methods may not be enough for people who are outside during peak mosquito hours or who live in areas where these methods are not widely used.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the use of topical repellents to prevent malaria with not using them or using other methods. We looked at studies that included people living in areas where malaria is common and evaluated the evidence to see if topical repellents can reduce the risk of getting malaria.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that looked at the use of topical repellents to prevent malaria. When we combined the results, we found that topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria, but the evidence is not strong. The repellents seem to be safe, with few people experiencing any side effects, mostly mild skin reactions. However, we need more research, especially in high-risk groups like refugees, to be sure if topical repellents can provide additional protection against malaria.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had limitations, such as biases in how they were conducted, and not all studies provided complete information. This means we cannot be sure if topical repellents really work to prevent malaria or if they are safe for everyone.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
