However, when we only looked at studies with low risk of bias, we found that antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infections.\n- We found that antibiotics may not increase the risk of vomiting or diarrhea, but may increase the risk of allergy. The evidence was limited and uncertain regarding potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, and should aim to provide more certain evidence on the potential harms.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is early pregnancy loss? Early pregnancy loss, also known as miscarriage, is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks. It's a common experience for many women. Managing early pregnancy loss often involves a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This procedure is called uterine evacuation.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if giving antibiotics before these procedures can help prevent infections and what the potential harms might be. We were interested in knowing whether antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infections after uterine evacuation procedures.\n\n### How is early pregnancy loss treated?\nEarly pregnancy loss can be treated in different ways, depending on the situation. Sometimes, the body will pass the pregnancy tissue on its own. In other cases, a procedure called uterine evacuation is needed to remove the tissue. This procedure can be done in a hospital or clinic.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving antibiotics to not giving antibiotics before uterine evacuation procedures. We looked at the results of these studies to see if antibiotics made a difference in preventing infections.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found six studies with a total of 4371 women who underwent uterine evacuation procedures. The evidence suggested that antibiotics may have little or no effect on preventing uterine infections after these procedures, but this evidence is uncertain. However, when we only looked at studies with low risk of bias, we found that antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infections by 43%. We also found that antibiotics may not increase the risk of vomiting or diarrhea, but may increase the risk of allergy. The evidence was limited and uncertain regarding potential harms.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence regarding the potential harms of antibiotics, such as vomiting, diarrhea, allergy, and anaphylaxis, because the data were limited and uncertain. The studies had some limitations, and the evidence is uncertain. However, the sensitivity analysis based on low-risk studies showed a larger effect size with high certainty.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023. This means that our search for studies only went up to October 2023, so any studies published after that date are not included in our review.",
