It affects many women, especially those over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared oestrogen therapy with other treatments or no treatment for pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women. We summarized and evaluated the results of these studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1002 women. The studies were generally of poor quality, and we were unable to perform subgroup analyses due to insufficient data.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were of poor quality and had varying designs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
