  "text": "What are the benefits and risks of pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane flap versus pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for large macular holes?\n\nKey messages:\n- The inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique may improve vision at three months or more after surgery, but it is unclear if it reduces vision problems at one month.\n- The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the proportion of eyes achieving macular hole closure.\n- There is a need for high-quality multicenter randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness and safety of these two techniques.\n\nIntroduction:\nMacular holes are a type of eye problem that can cause loss of central vision. Pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling is a common surgery for macular holes, but it has a higher failure rate for large macular holes. The inverted ILM flap technique is a new approach that may be more effective.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique versus pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for treating large macular holes.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared these two techniques and summarized their results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that compared these two techniques. The studies included 285 eyes of 275 participants. The inverted ILM flap technique may improve vision at three months or more after surgery, but it is unclear if it reduces vision problems at one month. The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the proportion of eyes achieving macular hole closure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and there were some concerns about the risk of bias.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
