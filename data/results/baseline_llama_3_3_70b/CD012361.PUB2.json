It is sometimes used in children and infants, even though it is not officially approved for this age group.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is effective and safe for use in newborn babies who are on mechanical ventilation.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other medicines or a placebo for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe did not find any studies that met our criteria for inclusion in the review. However, we did find four ongoing studies that may provide some evidence in the future.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are no completed studies that met our criteria for inclusion in the review.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and risks of using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about its effectiveness or safety. Future studies should address the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants.",
