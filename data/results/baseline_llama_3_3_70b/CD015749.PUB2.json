The evidence was very uncertain, and we could not find any clear evidence for an effect of multimodal interventions on physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, or biochemical markers.\n* We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n* Future research in this area should focus on methodologically rigorous, well-powered randomized controlled trials with adequate interaction times to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia across chronic illnesses.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is cachexia? \nCachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome that occurs in people with chronic illnesses, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia experience unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. \n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out which types of multimodal interventions work best to help people with cachexia, and what the benefits and harms of these interventions are. Multimodal interventions combine two or more types of treatment, such as medicines, nutrition, and exercise, to treat the syndrome.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared multimodal interventions with treatment as usual, or with other types of interventions. We evaluated the evidence from these studies to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found nine studies with 926 adults, and the studies were conducted in different countries and included people with different types of chronic illnesses, such as cancer, COPD, and HIV/AIDS. The evidence was very uncertain, and we could not find any clear evidence for an effect of multimodal interventions on physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, or biochemical markers.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. The evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
