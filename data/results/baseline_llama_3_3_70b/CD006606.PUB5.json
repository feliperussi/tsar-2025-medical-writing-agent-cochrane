It occurs in 8% to 13% of all women of reproductive age and 50% of women presenting with infertility. \n\nWhat are the common treatments for infertility in women with PCOS? \nWomen with PCOS may need assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to raise their chances of getting pregnant. However, these treatments can have risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to compare the benefits and risks of using in vitro maturation with conventional IVF or ICSI for women with PCOS who are having trouble getting pregnant. In vitro maturation is a technique where immature eggs are collected from the ovaries and then matured in a laboratory before being fertilized.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared in vitro maturation with conventional IVF or ICSI for women with PCOS. We found four studies that involved 810 women and evaluated the evidence to determine the benefits and risks of in vitro maturation.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that in vitro maturation may not increase the chances of live birth compared to conventional IVF, but it does increase the chances of miscarriage. In vitro maturation also reduces the risk of OHSS. However, we are very uncertain about these findings due to the limited number of studies and their quality.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had limitations in their design. The evidence does not cover all the people, interventions, and outcomes we were interested in. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of in vitro maturation for women with PCOS.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
