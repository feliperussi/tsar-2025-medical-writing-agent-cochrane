GnRHas may reduce pain in some women, but we are uncertain about their effect compared to other treatments.\n- We are uncertain about the effect of GnRHas on bone mineral density, but there may be a slight decrease in bone density when women are treated with GnRHas compared to some other treatments.\n- Future research should focus on comparing GnRHas to other treatments, measuring their effect on pain and bone mineral density, and assessing their safety and potential side effects.\n\n## Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n### What is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects many women of childbearing age. It can cause painful periods, pain during sex, and infertility. One way to treat endometriosis is with medicines called gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). These medicines can help reduce pain, but they can also have side effects, such as hot flashes and a decrease in bone density.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if GnRHas are effective and safe for treating endometriosis. Specifically, we looked at how well GnRHas reduce pain, improve quality of life, and affect bone mineral density compared to other treatments. We also wanted to know about any potential side effects of GnRHas.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared GnRHas to other treatments for endometriosis. We found 72 studies that involved over 7,000 women. We looked at the results of these studies to see if GnRHas are effective and safe.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found that GnRHas may reduce pain in some women with endometriosis, but the evidence is not strong. We are uncertain about how GnRHas compare to other treatments, such as danazol or progestogens. We also found that GnRHas may decrease bone mineral density, but again, the evidence is not strong. Some women who took GnRHas reported side effects, such as hot flashes.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had serious flaws, such as poor reporting of methods, and were too small to give reliable results. This means that we cannot be sure if GnRHas are effective and safe for treating endometriosis.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to May 2022.",
