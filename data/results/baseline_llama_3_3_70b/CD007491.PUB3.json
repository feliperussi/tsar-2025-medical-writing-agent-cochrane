This type of care is always provided for a limited time period. \n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if admission avoidance hospital at home is effective and cost-effective compared to inpatient hospital care. Specifically, we were interested in whether it could improve health outcomes, reduce the need for hospital readmissions, and decrease healthcare costs for older people who need acute care.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared admission avoidance hospital at home with inpatient hospital care. We then summarized and combined the results of these studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admission avoidance hospital at home.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that included 3100 participants. These studies compared admission avoidance hospital at home with inpatient hospital care for older people who needed acute care. The participants had a range of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and other acute medical conditions. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, and most were funded by healthcare organizations or research institutions.\n\nThe studies showed that for older people, admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality, readmission to hospital, or patient self-reported health status. However, it probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care and decreases costs. Satisfaction with healthcare may also be improved with admission avoidance hospital at home, although we have little confidence in this evidence due to limitations in the studies.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for some outcomes because the studies were small or had some limitations. For example, some studies did not report all the outcomes we were interested in, and there was variability in how the outcomes were measured. Additionally, the studies were mostly conducted in specific populations, such as older people with chronic conditions, which may limit the applicability of the findings to other populations.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022. This review updates our previous review, and we have included the most recent studies available up to this date.",
