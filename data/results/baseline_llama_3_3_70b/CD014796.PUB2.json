They are an integral part of preventive services in many healthcare systems, aiming to reduce morbidity and mortality. Despite their widespread use, there is ongoing debate about their effectiveness, with some studies suggesting they have little or no impact on all-cause mortality, cancer, cardiovascular mortality, or cardiovascular morbidity.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify how stakeholders, including clients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, perceive and experience general health checks, and what factors influence their commissioning, delivery, and uptake. This qualitative evidence synthesis aimed to supplement and contextualize the findings of a previous Cochrane review on the effectiveness of general health checks by exploring the values and experiences associated with these checks.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that utilized qualitative methods to explore the perceptions and experiences of stakeholders regarding general health checks. We included studies that examined the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks, focusing on individual, intervention, and contextual factors. Our search covered the period from inception to August 2022, and we analyzed 36 studies out of 146 that met our inclusion criteria.\n\n### What did we find?\nOur analysis revealed that general health checks are valued by clients and healthcare providers for their potential to motivate lifestyle changes and provide reassurance. Clients appreciated the comprehensive approach of these checks, which included various tests, while healthcare providers deemed individualized approaches tailored to clients' health risks as suitable. However, barriers to delivery and uptake were identified, including time constraints, staff shortages, and concerns about costs. The availability and accessibility of general health checks, as well as awareness systems, played significant roles in clients' decision-making. We found that healthcare providers played a crucial role in motivating participation, but negative experiences with unqualified providers discouraged attendance.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in our findings, but our confidence is limited by the methodological limitations of the included studies. The evidence suggests that cultural background, social norms, religion, gender, and language shape the perception of prevention and disease, thereby influencing the uptake of general health checks. However, we have low or very low confidence in findings related to the contextual level and reasons for commissioning general health checks.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022. This review updates our previous understanding of general health checks, providing new insights into the perceptions and experiences of stakeholders. However, the results from the update search in September 2023 have not yet been incorporated, indicating a need for ongoing research to fully understand the benefits and risks of general health checks.",
