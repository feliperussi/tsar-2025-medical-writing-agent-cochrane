It is common in athletes who jump and land a lot, like basketball and volleyball players. The pain is usually at the front of the knee, just below the kneecap. \n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which types of exercise work best to help people with patellar tendinopathy. We also wanted to know what the benefits and risks of exercise are for this condition. \n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise with no treatment, glucocorticoid injections, surgery, and other treatments. We looked at the results of these studies to see what they told us about the benefits and risks of exercise for patellar tendinopathy.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found seven studies with 211 participants. Most of the participants were athletes, and they had been experiencing knee pain for an average of 41.6 months. The studies compared exercise with no treatment, glucocorticoid injections, surgery, and other treatments like stretching and pulsed ultrasound. \n\nThe results showed that exercise may make little or no difference in pain and function compared to other treatments. However, we are very uncertain about the results due to the small number of studies and limitations in the research. \n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had limitations. For example, the people in the studies were not randomly assigned to the different treatment groups, which could affect the results. Also, the studies did not measure all the outcomes that are important to people with patellar tendinopathy, like quality of life and return to sport. \n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
