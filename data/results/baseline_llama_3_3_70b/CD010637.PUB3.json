  "text": "Can physical exercise help people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency? \n\n### Key Messages\n- We are uncertain about the benefits and risks of physical exercise for people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency because the evidence is very uncertain.\n- The evidence does not clearly show whether physical exercise improves symptoms, quality of life, or prevents venous leg ulcers in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n- Future research should investigate the effects of different types of exercise protocols, sample size, blinding, and homogeneity according to the severity of disease to better understand the benefits and risks of physical exercise for people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins have problems returning blood from the legs to the heart. This can cause symptoms like pain, swelling, and skin changes in the legs. If not treated, CVI can lead to more serious problems like venous leg ulcers. \n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if physical exercise can help reduce symptoms of CVI, improve quality of life, and prevent venous leg ulcers. We looked at studies that compared physical exercise programs with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared physical exercise programs with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI. We then summarized and evaluated the results of these studies to understand the benefits and risks of physical exercise for people with this condition.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found five studies with a total of 146 participants. These studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise program. The exercise programs differed between studies. We found that the evidence is very uncertain about whether physical exercise improves symptoms, quality of life, or prevents venous leg ulcers. We are uncertain if exercise alters the intensity of signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, or health-related quality of life.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had limitations, such as small sample sizes and differences in how the exercise programs were designed and measured. This means that we cannot be sure if physical exercise is beneficial or harmful for people with non-ulcerated CVI.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
