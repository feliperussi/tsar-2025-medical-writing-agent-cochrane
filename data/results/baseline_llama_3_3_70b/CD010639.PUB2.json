This type of work can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, which can compromise worker alertness and have negative effects on occupational health and safety.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. We looked at different components of shift schedules, such as the permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different shift schedule adaptations and their effects on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants that investigated different shift schedule adaptations. The studies were heterogeneous, meaning they were different in terms of their design, population, and outcome measurements. We found that forward rotation and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, but the evidence is very uncertain. We also found that limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were often small, and there were concerns about the way the studies were designed and conducted. The evidence does not cover all the different types of shift workers, and there is a need for more high-quality studies to draw conclusions on the effects of shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
