Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated. Peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants and are characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone.\n\nWhat can people do to treat periodontitis and peri-implant diseases? \nTreatment aims to clean the pockets around teeth or dental implants and prevent damage to surrounding soft tissue and bone. This includes improvement of oral hygiene, risk factor control (e.g., encouraging cessation of smoking), and surgical interventions. The key aspect of standard non-surgical treatment is the removal of the subgingival biofilm using subgingival instrumentation (SI). Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) can be used as an adjunctive treatment to SI.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if aPDT helps to improve outcomes such as pocket depth, bleeding, and attachment loss when used with standard subgingival instrumentation (SI) compared to SI alone.\n\n### What did we do? \nWe searched for studies that compared the use of aPDT with SI to SI alone or placebo aPDT. We combined and summarized the results of these studies and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find? \nWe found 50 studies with 1407 participants. Most studies were small and had high or unclear risks of bias. We found that aPDT may have little to no effect on clinical outcomes such as pocket depth, bleeding, and attachment loss. We also found that aPDT was not associated with any serious adverse effects. However, the evidence is very uncertain, and we cannot be sure if aPDT is beneficial or not.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. The evidence does not cover all the people, interventions, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence? \nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
