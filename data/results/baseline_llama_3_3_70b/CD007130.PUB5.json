It usually includes exercise, education, and support to help people make lifestyle changes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in people with heart disease.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation and found 24 trials with 3046 participants. We compared and summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes for people with heart disease. However, the evidence is of low certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision. We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. The evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
