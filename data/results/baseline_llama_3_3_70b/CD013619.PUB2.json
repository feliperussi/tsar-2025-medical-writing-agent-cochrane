  "text": "Can family presence during resuscitation help reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in relatives? What are the benefits and risks of allowing family members to be present during resuscitation of patients?\n\n### Key Messages\n- We found that family presence during resuscitation may reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression in relatives, but the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions.\n- Family presence during resuscitation does not seem to affect patient care or medical treatment, and does not increase personal stress in healthcare professionals.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the effects of family presence during resuscitation, as the current evidence is limited and not robust enough to make clear recommendations.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation refers to the practice of allowing family members to be present with their loved ones during medical emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, when resuscitation efforts are being made. This practice is based on the principle that patients and their relatives often want to be actively involved in decisions about treatment, even in critical situations.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder-related symptoms in them, as well as other psychological outcomes. We also looked at how family presence during resuscitation affects patient care and medical treatment, and the personal stress experienced by healthcare professionals.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared family presence during resuscitation with no family presence. We found two trials involving a total of 595 participants and synthesized the data narratively.\n\n### What did we find?\nThe results showed that family presence during resuscitation may reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression in relatives. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. We also found that family presence during resuscitation does not seem to affect patient care or medical treatment, and does not increase personal stress in healthcare professionals.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and had a high risk of bias. The evidence for all outcomes except one was assessed as very low certainty. This means that we are not confident in the evidence, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of family presence during resuscitation.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022. \n\nNote: The provided response is a direct transformation of the given abstract into a Plain Language Summary, following the specified guidelines and structure.
