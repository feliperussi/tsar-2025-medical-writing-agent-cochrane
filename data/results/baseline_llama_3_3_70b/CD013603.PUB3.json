This approach aims to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, especially in low-resource settings.\n\nWhy is primary healthcare integration important?\nPrimary healthcare integration is important because it can help ensure that people receive the care they need in a timely and effective manner. By integrating different healthcare services, primary healthcare integration can help address the complex health needs of individuals and communities.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration. We aimed to map the qualitative literature on this topic to characterize the evidence base and identify areas for future research.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that reported on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration. We analyzed the data from these studies to identify patterns and themes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 184 studies that reported on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration. These studies were conducted in 37 countries and covered a range of healthcare services, including mental and behavioral health, HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health. The studies used various methods, including interviews, focus group discussions, and observational studies. We identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated, as well as three different integration strategies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were heterogeneous, and there were gaps in the geographical spread of the studies. Additionally, the evidence base is complicated by the diversity of primary healthcare integration interventions, which can make it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in shaping the implementation and impact of primary healthcare integration.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",
