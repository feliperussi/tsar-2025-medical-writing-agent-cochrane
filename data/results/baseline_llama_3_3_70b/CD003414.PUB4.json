It's often used after in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other fertility treatments. FET can increase the chances of getting pregnant and having a baby.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for endometrial preparation prior to FET. We looked at natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) cycle FET, and ovulation induction cycle FET. We also compared subtypes of these regimens, such as HT with or without a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa).\n\n### How is frozen embryo transfer prepared?\nHow is the womb prepared for frozen embryo transfer? \nBefore FET, the womb needs to be prepared to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy. This can be done using different cycle regimens, such as natural cycle FET, hormone therapy (HT) cycle FET, or ovulation induction cycle FET. Each regimen has its own way of preparing the womb for the frozen embryo.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different cycle regimens for FET and summarized their results. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence to determine how confident we can be in the findings.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found 32 studies that involved 6352 women. The studies compared natural cycle FET, HT cycle FET, and ovulation induction cycle FET. We found that the certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low, which means that we are uncertain about the effectiveness and safety of each cycle regimen.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. The evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
