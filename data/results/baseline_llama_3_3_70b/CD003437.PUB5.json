It can affect how well they recover and their overall quality of life. Despite its importance, depression after stroke often goes undetected or is not treated properly.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if pharmacological interventions (medicines), non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these treatments can help people with depression after a stroke. We also wanted to understand the potential benefits and harms of these treatments.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for depression after stroke, including medicines, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. We looked at how these treatments affected the number of people who were depressed and if they had any unwanted effects.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with 5831 participants that looked at various treatments for depression after stroke. The evidence from these studies was not very strong, which means we are not very confident in the results. However, it suggested that medicines and psychological therapy might help reduce depression, while non-invasive brain stimulation might not have a significant effect. Some combinations of treatments also showed promise, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had limitations, such as not being sure if the people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, and the studies were often small. This means that the results could be due to chance rather than the treatments themselves. More research with better-designed studies is needed to give us clearer answers.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
