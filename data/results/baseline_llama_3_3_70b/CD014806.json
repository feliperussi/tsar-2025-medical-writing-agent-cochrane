However, we are not very sure about how well it works compared to other methods like non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, or laser acupuncture.\n* Sucrose might be as effective as glucose, expressed breast milk, or skin-to-skin care in reducing pain, but we are not very confident in these findings.\n* We need more research to understand the benefits and risks of using sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies, especially when combined with other methods.\n\n## Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n### What is heel lance and why is it painful for newborn babies?\nHeel lance is a procedure where a small cut is made on a newborn baby's heel to collect blood for testing. This can be painful for the baby. Healthcare providers are looking for ways to reduce this pain.\n\n### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if giving sucrose (a type of sugar) to newborn babies before a heel lance helps reduce their pain. We also wanted to compare sucrose to other methods of pain relief, like non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, or laser acupuncture.\n\n## What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared sucrose to other methods of pain relief for newborn babies having a heel lance. We looked at the results of these studies and evaluated how confident we can be in the evidence.\n\n## What did we find?\nWe found 55 studies that included over 6,000 newborn babies. The studies compared sucrose to various other methods of pain relief. The evidence suggests that sucrose probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies when they have a heel lance, compared to not giving them anything. However, we are not very sure about how well it works compared to other methods.\n\n## What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were not all the same, and some had problems with how they were done. We need more research to understand the benefits and risks of using sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies.\n\n## How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",
