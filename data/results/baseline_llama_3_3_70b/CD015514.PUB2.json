Retinal displacement can cause vision problems like metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia.\n- Face-down positioning may reduce some complications, like outer retinal folds, but may increase the risk of high eye pressure. High eye pressure can be a serious side effect that needs to be monitored.\n- More research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the benefits and risks of face-down positioning after eye surgery. This will help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best position after surgery.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment? \nA macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a serious eye condition where the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, detaches from the eye. This can cause significant vision loss and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved, the vision loss can be particularly severe.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if face-down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy, a type of eye surgery used to repair retinal detachments, reduces the risk of retinal displacement. We also looked at whether face-down positioning affects other outcomes, such as vision quality and complications like outer retinal folds and high eye pressure.\n\n### How is retinal detachment treated?\nRetinal detachment is typically treated with surgery. One common surgical method is pars plana vitrectomy, where the doctor removes the vitreous gel from the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble to help the retina reattach. After surgery, the position of the patient's head and body may be important for the success of the surgery.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared face-down positioning with other positions after pars plana vitrectomy for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. We looked at the results of these studies to see if face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement and affects other outcomes.\n\n### What did we find?\nWe found a few studies that suggest face-down positioning may help reduce retinal displacement, but the evidence is not strong. We also found that face-down positioning may reduce some complications, like outer retinal folds, but may increase the risk of high eye pressure. For example, one study found that face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. However, another study found no evidence of a difference in postoperative outer retinal folds when comparing face-down versus face-up positioning at one and three months.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and had some limitations. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the benefits and risks of face-down positioning after eye surgery. Future studies should be well-designed and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is based on studies that were available up to November 2022, and we did not find any new studies that would change our conclusions. However, there are ongoing trials that may provide more information in the future.",
