However, we did not find any difference in overall survival between the maintenance and control groups.\n- Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low due to concerns about the quality of the studies and the small number of participants.\n- Future research should focus on evaluating the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL, including novel interventions such as B-cell receptor inhibitors and B-cell leukaemia-2/lymphoma-2 inhibitors.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)? \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. As the progression-free period shortens after each successive treatment, strategies such as maintenance therapy are needed to improve the degree and duration of response to previous therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out which types of maintenance therapy work best for people with CLL and what their benefits and harms are. We were interested in comparing different maintenance therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory agents, and targeted therapies.\n\n### What did we do? \nWe searched for studies that compared different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We looked at studies that compared maintenance therapies with observation or placebo. We evaluated the quality of the evidence and rated our confidence in the results.\n\n### What did we find? \nWe found 11 studies with 2393 participants that met our criteria. The studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or placebo. We found that anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab or ofatumumab, likely improve progression-free survival but may increase harmful side effects. Immunomodulatory drug therapy, such as lenalidomide, likely improves progression-free survival but may also increase harmful side effects. However, we did not find any difference in overall survival between the maintenance and control groups. The effects of alemtuzumab maintenance are uncertain. We did not find any studies that evaluated other novel maintenance interventions.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low due to concerns about the quality of the studies and the small number of participants. The studies had some limitations, such as a high risk of bias and a lack of data on some outcomes. Therefore, we need to be cautious when interpreting the results.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022. We searched for studies up to this date and included all relevant studies in our analysis. However, new studies may have been published since then, and our results may not reflect the latest evidence.",
