Is TENS more effective than other treatments for period pain?\n\n### Key Messages\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain in women with period pain compared to placebo or no treatment, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- It is unclear if TENS is more effective than other treatments for period pain, such as acetaminophen or acupressure, because the studies had limitations.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of using TENS for period pain and to compare it to other treatments.\n\n### Introduction to the review topic and review aims\n#### What is period pain and how is it currently treated?\nPeriod pain, also known as primary dysmenorrhea, is a common problem for many women. It can cause significant discomfort and disrupt daily activities. Current treatments include over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and hormonal contraceptives. However, these treatments may not work for everyone, and some women may experience side effects.\n\n#### What is TENS and how does it work?\nTENS, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, is a non-pharmacological treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain. It works by sending signals to the brain that can help block pain messages. TENS can be used to treat various types of pain, including period pain.\n\n#### What did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if TENS can reduce pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea and if it is safe to use. We also wanted to compare the effectiveness of TENS to other treatments for period pain.\n\n### What did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared TENS with placebo, no treatment, or other treatments for period pain. We found 20 studies that involved 585 women.\n\n### What did we find?\nThe studies showed that high-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, we are not certain about the effectiveness of TENS because the studies had some limitations. We also found that TENS may have some benefits compared to other treatments, but we need more research to confirm this.\n\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies had limitations, such as a high risk of bias. This means that the results may not be entirely reliable. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of using TENS for period pain.\n\n### How up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",
