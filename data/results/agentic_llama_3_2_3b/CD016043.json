However, the quality of the evidence for these approaches is generally low due to a lack of robust studies.\n- Further evaluation of the effectiveness of these approaches is needed to inform improvements in eye care services in community and primary care settings.\n- The review suggests that school-based and outreach approaches are more commonly used in community care, while vision centre and health centre approaches are more commonly used in primary care, but more research is needed to understand the effectiveness of these approaches in different settings.\n\n**Background**\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. Spectacle correction can effectively address this, and in 2021 the World Health Assembly set a target to increase effective coverage of refractive error services by 40 % by 2030. Achieving this goal requires strengthening equitable access to refractive and optical care within community and primary‑care settings.\n\n**Aims**\nThis review will map the range of approaches used to deliver refractive and optical care in community and primary‑care contexts and examine how these approaches are evaluated. Specifically, it will answer: (1) What delivery models exist for refractive and optical services in these settings? (2) How do models differ across regions and contexts? (3) What are the strengths, limitations, and evaluation methods for each model?\n\n**Summary**\nWe conducted a systematic search for studies on approaches to refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings. The results were combined and presented as tables, figures, and case studies to inform the development of technical guidance aimed at strengthening access to refractive and optical services.\n\n**What did we find?**\nTotal studies: 175; study duration: 20 years; funding sources: World Health Organization (WHO) Vision and Eye Care Programme, ATscale Global Partnership; population: preschool and school-aged children and adults; settings: community and primary care across WHO African region, the Americas, and WHO Eastern Mediterranean region; interventions: school-based, pharmacy, outreach, vision centre, health centre, door-to-door delivery models; evaluation gaps: few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\n\n**Main results**\nSeveral approaches to delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings were found, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models, as well as vision centre, health centre, and door-to-door delivery. In community care, school-based and outreach approaches were predominant, while in primary care, a vision centre approach was mainly used. In the WHO African region, the school-based and outreach approaches were mainly reported, while in the Americas, the outreach approach was mostly used. Very few approaches for service delivery were reported in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. The review also found that there is a need for further evaluation of the effectiveness of these approaches.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2002 of search.",
