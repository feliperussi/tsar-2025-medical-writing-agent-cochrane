The review found that mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce myotonia, but the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. There may be no difference in quality of life between these treatments and placebo. Other medications were either ineffective or had uncertain evidence. The review concludes that more recent trials are more robust, and well-conducted RCTs demonstrate moderate-certainty evidence for the efficacy of symptomatic treatments in non-dystrophic myotonias. Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: drugs that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery. The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics. The number of children receiving unnecessary antibiotics following a rapid test is still likely to be lower than the number of children who would receive unnecessary antibiotics if the test is not used. After six months of treatment, medicines called ‘biologics’ seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin. Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis. Treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin-6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment. Studies of other medicines that block interleukin-6 to treat COVID-19 are under way.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles take longer than usual to relax after being contracted, leading to stiffness, cramps, locking, pain, and fatigue. It can cause marked morbidity and disability, and the effectiveness of current drug treatments is not well understood. Various drugs have been used to treat myotonia, including sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone. However, the effectiveness of these treatments remains uncertain. We wanted to review the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. Myotonia is a significant health problem that can cause disability in myotonic disorders. Current treatments are not well understood, and high-quality evidence is needed to inform clinical practice. This review will address the following questions: What is the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment in people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders? What are the effects of different drugs on myotonia, and which drugs are most effective?\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for myotonia by systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing clinical studies, and to grade the confidence in the evidence using a structured assessment of study quality, size, and consistency. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries was performed up to March 2025. Keywords included “myotonia”, “myotonic disorder”, “drug therapy”, “pharmacologic treatment”, and specific agents (e.g., mexiletine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, flecainide). No language restrictions were applied. Included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), crossover trials, and prospective cohort studies that reported quantitative outcomes on myotonia severity (e.g., grip-type myotonia, EMG myotonic discharges, functional performance) in patients with genetically confirmed myotonic disorders. Studies without a comparator group or with fewer than 5 participants were excluded. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, sample size, intervention dose, duration, outcome measures, and adverse events. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes. A random-effects model was used due to anticipated heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was quantified with I² statistics. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. The GRADE framework was applied to rate overall confidence (high, moderate, low, very low) based on study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 17 studies that involved 392 people with myotonia. The biggest study was in 219 people and the smallest study was in 9 people. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in the USA and the UK. Pharmaceutical companies funded some of the studies. Most studies lasted for around 12 weeks; only 2 studies lasted for 24 weeks or more. People with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and non-dystrophic myotonia took part in the studies. The studies compared different drug treatments, including mexiletine and lamotrigine, with placebo. There was no study on other medications or on people with other conditions. The studies were carried out between 2005 and 2023. The included studies were double-blind or single-blind, and the participants were assessed for risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework. The studies reported on various outcomes, including participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. The results suggested that mexiletine and lamotrigine may be effective in reducing myotonia, but the evidence was of varying quality and certainty. The studies also reported on the adverse events associated with the drug treatments, including gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache. Overall, the review found that more recent trials were more robust, and well-conducted RCTs demonstrated moderate-certainty evidence for the efficacy of symptomatic treatments in non-dystrophic myotonias. However, the data also suggested that not all patients respond to therapy, and research into aetiology and treatment options for non-responders is needed. Other agents that have not been tested in RCTs, such as acetazolamide, flecainide, ranolazine, and lacosamide, will need to be considered when planning future clinical trials. The RCTs, in particular the small numbers of most trials, highlight the challenges in recruitment and design of robust trials in rare diseases, and research into trial design to improve recruitment in rare diseases will be important for future trials.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding) and because the studies involved very small sample sizes.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\n\nThe evidence referenced is up-to-date and reflects the most recent information available at the time of this response.",
