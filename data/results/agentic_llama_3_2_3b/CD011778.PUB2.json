  "text": "Here is the revised Plain Language Summary:\n\n**Does using a special light treatment to kill bacteria help improve periodontal and peri-implant disease?**\n\nAdjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may not improve clinical outcomes for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases when compared to subgingival instrumentation (SI) alone, due to very low-certainty evidence. Any apparent differences between aPDT and SI alone were not judged to be clinically important. No studies reported pocket closure at six months, participant satisfaction or quality of life.\n\n**What do we know about periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?**\n\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions occurring in the whole mouth. Left untreated, periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus. Peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants and are characterised by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Treatment aims to clean the pockets around teeth or dental implants and prevent damage to surrounding soft tissue and bone, including improvement of oral hygiene, risk factor control (e.g. encouraging cessation of smoking) and surgical interventions.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\n\nThe researchers wanted to assess the effects of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They wanted to know if adjunctive aPDT leads to improved clinical outcomes during the active or supportive treatment of periodontitis; moreover, results suggest that any improvements may be too small to be clinically important. The researchers also wanted to find out if adjunctive aPDT can cause any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did the researchers find?**\n\nThink: Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may make little to no difference to the clinical outcomes of periodontitis treatment, and the evidence is very uncertain. For every 100 people with periodontitis, aPDT probably reduces the risk of infection and dry socket after tooth extraction by 0-1%.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\n\nThis review is based on the available evidence up to 14 February 2024. The evidence is very uncertain, and more research is needed to determine the effects of aPDT in people with peri-implantitis and to increase the certainty of the evidence.",
