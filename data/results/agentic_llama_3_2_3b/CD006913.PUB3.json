Psychological treatment, also known as talk therapy, is a type of treatment that aims to address these psychological issues and improve the quality of life for individuals with IBD.\"],\"what_did_we_want_to_find_out\":[\"To assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people of any age with IBD.\"],\"review_summary\":[\"This summary provides an overview of the review authors' core actions and clearly links to the research aims and study design.\"],\"explanation\":[\"The review aimed to assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. The review included studies that examined the effects of various types of psychological interventions, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques.\"],\"limitations_of_evidence\":[\"While the studies provide valuable insights, they are limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and potential selection bias, which may affect the generalizability of the findings to broader populations.\"],\"evidence_currency_statement\":[\"The evidence is up to date to May 2023.\"],\"authors_conclusions\":[\"Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression, and anxiety slightly.
