  "text": "**Does topical silver diamine fluoride (a liquid medicine applied to teeth) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?**\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Topical silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may help prevent new caries in the primary dentition and root caries, but the evidence is very uncertain for other caries outcome measures in this dentition and in all caries outcomes for coronal surfaces of permanent dentition.\n- Compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may offer little or no benefit in preventing new caries in the primary dentition, but the evidence is very uncertain for other caries outcome measures in the primary dentition and for preventing new caries in the permanent dentition.\n- Future research is needed to determine the impact of SDF staining of teeth and to measure the impact of clustering issues within participants, as well as to assess the effects of different approaches to SDF application and compare SDF to other treatments.\n\n**What is dental caries?**\nDental caries is the world's most prevalent disease. It is caused by the bacteria in the mouth breaking down food, especially sugars and starches, and leading to tooth decay. If left untreated, dental caries can cause pain and negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fluoride varnishes, sealants, and fillings.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nThis review evaluates the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in children and adults, including its comparison to other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) with glass ionomer cement (GIC) or GI material.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review provides an extremely brief summary, focusing on the core actions taken by the authors, clearly linking to the research aims and handling study designs concisely.\n\n**What did we find?**\nA concise summary describing the key characteristics of the requested data, formatted as a plain string. Topical silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may help prevent new caries in children and adults, but the evidence is very uncertain. SDF probably prevents new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other caries outcome measures. The impact of SDF staining of teeth was poorly reported and the evidence for adverse effects is very uncertain. Additional well‑conducted studies are needed.\n\n**Limitations of Evidence**\nThis review found that the evidence for the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in preventing and managing dental caries in children and adults is very uncertain, and that more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence referenced is current as of the system's knowledge cutoff date (June 2024) and reflects the latest available information.",
