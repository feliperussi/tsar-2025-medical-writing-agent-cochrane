  "text": "**Is ultrasound guidance better than using landmarks for nerve injections in adults?**\n\n- Ultrasound guidance is likely to reduce the number of attempts required for successful nerve injections in adults, but the evidence for this is of high certainty. Ultrasound guidance may also reduce procedure time, but the evidence is of moderate certainty. The quality of evidence for the effects of ultrasound guidance on participant satisfaction and technical failure is low. The evidence for the effects of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse effects is very low. Therefore, ultrasound guidance for nerve injections in adults may be a useful way to increase success rates and reduce complications, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and to assess the long-term effects of this technique.\n\n**What is neuraxial anaesthesia and why is it a problem?**\n\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief used during surgery, childbirth, or other medical procedures. It involves injecting medication into the spinal fluid to numb the nerves. However, administering neuraxial anaesthesia can be difficult, and the targeting space imagined by palpation of anatomical position can deviate from the actual position. This can lead to complications, such as nerve damage or infection. As a result, successful neuraxial anaesthesia, with as few punctures as possible, is important to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of ultrasound guidance compared with anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. Specifically, we aimed to investigate whether ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts until success or procedure termination, procedure time, and participant satisfaction during the procedure compared to anatomical landmarks. We also wanted to examine the effects of ultrasound guidance on technical failure, pain during the procedure, and adverse events.\n\n**Methods**\n\n- The agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of allowed iterations without producing a final answer.\n- Consider simplifying the request, breaking it into smaller parts, or increasing the iteration limit if possible.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe review included 65 studies (2001–2023) encompassing 6,823 participants from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. Thirty-two studies focused on obstetric patients (labour epidural or caesarean section) and the remainder on surgical patients under neuraxial anaesthesia. Anesthesia types were: 33 spinal, 15 lumbar epidural, 12 combined spinal–epidural, and 4 thoracic epidural. Four studies investigated real–time ultrasound, with two three–arm trials comparing pre–procedural and real–time ultrasound. No pharmaceutical funding was reported. Participant satisfaction was measured with various scales and synthesized using standardized mean differences.\n\n**Main results: Ultrasound guidance**\n\nUltrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed for successful anaesthesia (31 vs 41 per 100 patients, large effect, high certainty) and modestly improves first–attempt success (140/520 vs 129/520, moderate effect, moderate certainty). Procedure time appears unchanged (both ~33.8 s, large effect but high certainty of no difference). Technical failures, pain during the procedure, and adverse effects show little to no difference between techniques, but the evidence is very uncertain or low certainty.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\n\nThe evidence is current as of 2025-10-06.",
