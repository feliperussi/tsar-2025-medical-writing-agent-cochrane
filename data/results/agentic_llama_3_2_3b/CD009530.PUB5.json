Bronchoscopy-guided therapy probably makes little or no difference to any measure of chest scores assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan at either two or five years (moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: the effects of bronchoscopy-guided therapy on the number of hospital hospitalisations per year, nutritional parameters, and the average cost of care per participant, as well as the impact on health-related quality of life in adults with cystic fibrosis.\n- No evidence is available to support or refute the routine use of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary infection in adults with cystic fibrosis, due to a lack of robust evidence from only two well-designed randomised controlled studies.\n\n**Introduction/Aims:**\n- **What is the health problem?**\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, leading to recurring lung infections, respiratory failure, and early death. The mainstay of management is early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections. However, there are concerns about the sensitivity of oropharyngeal cultures in identifying lower respiratory organisms. Bronchoscopy and related procedures, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are invasive but allow for the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non‑sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may increase the accuracy of diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and improve the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits.\n- **What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to evaluate the use of bronchoscopy‑guided (also known as bronchoscopy‑directed) antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Methods:**\n- **Summary**\nThe review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, systematically searched the literature, screened studies, extracted data, and performed a meta‑analysis. It focused on randomized controlled trials, applied predefined inclusion criteria, and adhered to the critical methodological rules throughout the process.\n\n**Results:**\n- **What did we find?**\nTwo studies were included in this review. A total of 170 infants under six months of age with cystic fibrosis were enrolled in the first study, and data was available for 157 children. The second study enrolled 30 children with CF aged between five and 18 years. Both studies had a low risk of bias across most domains, but the risk of bias for allocation concealment and selective reporting was unclear in the smaller study. The studies lasted for a duration of 5 years. The studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health. The population characteristics included infants and children with cystic fibrosis. The studies were conducted in the United States. The interventions included bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy and standard care. The comparisons were between bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy and standard care. No studies were found on the use of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in adults with cystic fibrosis or the use of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in children with severe lung disease.\n- **Main results: Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in cystic fibrosis shows little or no difference in lung function, nutritional parameters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate counts, health-related quality of life, or eradication rates, but may increase the number of hospitalizations per year.**\nThink8: Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in cystic fibrosis shows little or no difference in lung function, nutritional parameters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate counts, health-related quality of life, or eradication rates, but may increase the number of hospitalizations per year.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**Currency:**\n- **The evidence is up to date to November 1, 2023 of search.**",
