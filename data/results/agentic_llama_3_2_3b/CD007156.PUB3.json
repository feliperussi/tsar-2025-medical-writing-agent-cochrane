OSF has a significant impact on eating and swallowing, affecting quality of life. There is an increased risk of oral malignancy in people with OSF. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing, and the mainstay of treatment has been behavioural interventions to support habit cessation.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for the management of oral submucous fibrosis.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention A, conducted a systematic search, screened eligible studies, extracted relevant data, and performed a meta‑analysis of randomized controlled trials, following standard review methodology.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nAntioxidants and pentoxifylline may provide a small improvement in mouth opening (3‑6 months) and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis, but the supporting evidence is of low certainty. Other treatments lack clear evidence of benefit. No interventions showed a significant effect on quality of life, and reported adverse effects were generally mild and transient, though evidence is uncertain. More high‑quality, adequately powered trials focusing on participant‑reported outcomes are needed.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.**",
