(Digital tools are like apps, games, or websites that help you manage your weight by tracking food, exercise, and other habits.)**\n\n- Digital tools for weight management in kids may have a small, short-term beneficial effect on fat mass compared to conventional care alone, but the effect on other outcome measures is unclear. (Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of digital tools for weight management in kids are unclear.)\n- Future studies should report their results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity; report full data to better enable data extraction and analysis; assess other important outcomes, particularly adverse events; control for both diet and physical activity in their analyses; and report the behavioral theory informing their intervention. (More research is needed to assess the long-term clinical benefit in children and adolescents and to determine the optimal digital interventions for managing obesity in this population.)\n\n**What is childhood obesity?**\nChildhood obesity is a serious public health problem that affects millions of children and adolescents worldwide. It increases the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity.\n\n**What are the aims of this review?**\nThis review aims to assess the effects and safety of digital technology interventions for the integrated management of obesity in children and adolescents. Specifically, it will examine the effects of digital interventions when used in combination with conventional care compared to conventional care alone, and when used alone compared to conventional care alone.\n\n**Search Strategy**\nWe identified studies that compared digital interventions with conventional care or no intervention for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n\n**Data Synthesis**\nThe results of the eligible studies were combined using meta‑analytic techniques to estimate the overall effect of digital technology on obesity outcomes.\n\n**Confidence Assessment**\nWe evaluated the certainty of the evidence by considering study design, sample size, risk of bias, and consistency, providing a graded confidence rating for the effects and safety of digital interventions.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThink8 - Digital health technology may have a small, short-term beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone, but the effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to April 14, 2025 of search.**",
