Currently, direct index measures and dose response biomarkers have been developed to provide assessments of vitamin A status.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to determine the accuracy of index tests routinely used as markers of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis summary is extremely brief, focusing on the core actions taken by the review authors. It clearly connects to the research aims and handles the study design in a concise manner.\n\n**Background**\n\nVitamin A deficiency is a health concern, especially in people who are at risk for it. Researchers have tried to find simple tests that can tell whether someone is deficient, but many of these tests have not been studied in the way that diagnostic-test research usually requires.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nAcross the 40 studies that were reviewed (covering 65 separate records), the tests that measured vitamin A in blood, retinol-binding protein, breast-milk vitamin A, and the relative dose-response (RDR) method generally showed low ability to correctly identify people who truly have a deficiency (sensitivity ranged from 0% to 54%). However, when the tests gave a negative result, they were usually correct (specificity was high, ranging from 74% to 94%).\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nA high specificity means the tests are good at ruling out deficiency when it is not present, but the low sensitivity means they miss many people who actually are deficient. Therefore, relying on these tests alone could leave many deficient individuals undetected.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nNone of the included studies were designed as proper diagnostic-test accuracy (DTA) studies, which limits how confidently we can trust the numbers. In several studies there were no participants who actually had deficiency according to the reference standard, so sensitivity could not be calculated. Data on newer methods such as modified RDR were not available.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCurrent laboratory methods for detecting vitamin A deficiency have high specificity but poor sensitivity, especially in at-risk populations. Clinicians should use these tests with caution and consider additional clinical information or more accurate reference standards when diagnosing vitamin A deficiency.",
