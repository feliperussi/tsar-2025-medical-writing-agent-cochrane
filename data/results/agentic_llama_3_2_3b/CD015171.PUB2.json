There are few RCTs that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière’s disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‑analyses of the results.\n- We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines and the evidence for betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids is all very low‑certainty.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as: a core outcome set; and consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.\n\n**What is Ménière's disease?**\n\nMénière's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that leads to sudden, spinning sensations (vertigo), fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. The exact cause remains a mystery, and the condition tends to come and go, making daily life unpredictable for those who have it. Various medicines—such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral drugs, and steroids—are often tried to calm the attacks, but we still don’t fully understand how they work or how well they help.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nOur goal was to look at the evidence from clinical studies to see whether taking these systemic drugs (the ones taken by mouth or injection) actually improves the lives of people with Ménière's disease compared with a placebo or no treatment. Specifically, we wanted to weigh any benefits—like fewer vertigo attacks or better hearing—against possible harms or side‑effects.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention X on outcome Y. The authors performed a systematic literature search, applied predefined inclusion criteria, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and conducted a meta‑analysis where appropriate, all in line with established methodological standards.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe included studies were 10 in total with a total of 848 participants. The studies lasted for varying durations, with most lasting between 3 to 12 months. The studies were conducted in multiple countries, with no specific country mentioned. The interventions evaluated were betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids, with no studies on antihistamines. The population characteristics were not specified, but the studies included adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. The studies were randomized controlled trials and quasi–RCTs, with no studies excluded due to funding sources. The primary outcomes evaluated were improvement in vertigo, change in vertigo, and serious adverse events, with secondary outcomes including disease–specific health–related quality of life, change in hearing, change in tinnitus, and other adverse effects. No studies were found on antihistamines, and the evidence for betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids was of low or very low certainty.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to September 14, 2022.**",
