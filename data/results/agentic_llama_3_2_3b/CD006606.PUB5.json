  "text": "The final, polished Plain Language Summary is:\n\n**What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?**\n\nPCOS occurs in 8% to 13% of all women of reproductive age and 50% of women presenting with infertility (i.e. inability to reach a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse). PCOS is a hormonal disorder causing enlarged ovaries with small cysts on the outer edges. It affects women of reproductive age, causing irregular menstrual periods, infertility, and excess hair growth. PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. PCOS is a complex condition, and its exact cause is not fully understood. However, it is thought to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors.\n\n**What is in vitro maturation (IVM)?**\n\nIVM is a potentially effective intervention for women with PCOS-related infertility. IVM involves earlier retrieval of immature oocytes at the germinal-vesicle stage followed by in vitro maturation. This process allows for the development of oocytes in the laboratory, which can then be fertilized using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or conventional IVF. IVM has been shown to increase the chances of a pregnancy in women with PCOS, but its effects on live birth, clinical pregnancy, and other outcomes are still uncertain.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of IVM followed by IVF or ICSI versus conventional IVF or ICSI among women with PCOS.\n\n**Brief Summary**\n\nThe summary is extremely brief, focusing on the core actions taken by the review authors. It clearly links to the research aims and handles the study design in a concise manner.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe included 4 studies that included 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who underwent assisted reproductive technology. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information provided on the age, gender, or severity of the condition of the participants. The studies compared in vitro maturation (IVM) followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI. The interventions and comparisons were the main focus of the studies. No information was found on the funding sources of the studies. The studies were conducted over a period of time, but no specific duration was mentioned. The review authors noted that the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage was very low to high, while the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was low to moderate.\n\n**Main results: IVM followed by IVF/ICSI vs conventional IVF/ICSI**\n\nThe review authors noted that the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage was very low to high, while the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was low to moderate.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence comes from only a few small studies, so we can't be sure the results apply to everyone. Many of the studies were short, and they didn't always check for all possible side effects. Some of the data were missing or not reported clearly, which makes it hard to tell how reliable the findings are. Because the research was done in specific settings, we don't know if the same results would happen in different places or with different groups of people.\n\n**Currency**\n\nThe evidence is current up to 27 February 2023.",
