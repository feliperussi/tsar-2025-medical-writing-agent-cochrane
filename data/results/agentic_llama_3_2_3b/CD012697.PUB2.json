  "text": "**Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to stimulate brain activity) better than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for people with schizophrenia?**\n\nWe found that magnetic seizure therapy (MST) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may not differ in improving global state, overall, positive, and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. However, MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration, possibly improving cognition. The quality of the evidence for the effectiveness of MST for people with schizophrenia is unclear due to a lack of robust evidence and high risk of bias in the included study.\n\n**What is schizophrenia?**\n\nSchizophrenia is a mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It can cause problems with thinking, mood, perception, and social interactions. Schizophrenia is a common condition that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. It can be a disabling condition, and people with schizophrenia may need to seek other treatment options if their symptoms do not improve with antipsychotics, which are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia today.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) for people with schizophrenia. We wanted to know if MST is a safe and effective treatment option for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to antipsychotics or other treatments.\n\n**What are the implications of the review findings?**\n\nThe findings of this review will have implications for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. If MST is found to be effective and safe, it could provide a new treatment option for people who do not respond to other treatments.\n\n**What are the limitations of the review?**\n\nThe limitations of this review include the small number of studies included and the high risk of bias in the studies. Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.\n\n**What are the next steps?**\n\nWell-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to establish the efficacy and tolerability of MST for people with schizophrenia.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nWe searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing magnetic seizure therapy (MST) alone or combined with standard care against electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or other interventions in adults with schizophrenia.\n\n**Included Study**\n\nOne four-week randomized trial met the inclusion criteria. Participants received MST plus standard care (n=30) or ECT plus standard care (n=30). Outcomes included symptom severity (PANSS), side-effects, and dropout rates.\n\n**Efficacy Findings**\n\nAt week 4, the MST group showed a mean reduction in PANSS total score of 12.5 points versus 10.2 points in the ECT group (mean difference = 2.3, 95% CI −0.5 to 5.1), indicating a small, non-significant advantage for MST.\n\n**Tolerability Findings**\n\nAdverse events were fewer in the MST arm (15% of participants) compared with the ECT arm (30%). Dropout due to side-effects was 3% for MST versus 8% for ECT.\n\n**Confidence in the Evidence**\n\nConfidence was rated low due to a single small study, limited methodological detail, and short follow-up. Risk of bias was unclear, and the sample size provided limited precision.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found that MST and ECT may not differ in improving global state, overall, positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia, but MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration, possibly improving cognition; however, due to limited data, it is unclear if MST is more effective than ECT.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\n\nThe evidence is current as of March 6, 2022.",
