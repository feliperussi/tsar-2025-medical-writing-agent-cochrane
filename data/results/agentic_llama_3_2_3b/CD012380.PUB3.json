We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in the adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or red blood cell transfusions in older children and adults to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of these interventions. This review examines interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). The goal is to assess the effectiveness of treatments such as red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of SCD, a genetic disorder affecting haemoglobin production. CKD damages the kidneys, can cause pain, organ damage, and premature death, and may develop early in life, potentially progressing to kidney failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). The review included 3 studies involving 385 participants. The studies lasted for up to 6 months. No information is available on the funding sources of the studies. The studies involved children and adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The studies compared hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and vitamin C to placebo. No studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions. The studies were conducted in multiple countries. The age range of the participants was not specified. The studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, but no specific information is available. The studies were limited by a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although four ongoing trials were identified since the last version of this review. Hydroxyurea compared with placebo in children with sickle cell disease shows uncertain evidence for improving overall kidney function, though it may help the kidneys concentrate urine; it probably has little or  no impact on acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalizations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) versus placebo in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria provide uncertain benefit for preventing or reducing kidney complications, and the same uncertainty applies to ACEIs versus vitamin C in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No studies have evaluated red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney outcomes in people with sickle cell disease.",
