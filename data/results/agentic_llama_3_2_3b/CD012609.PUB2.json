  "text": "Infliximab is probably more effective than placebo for keeping Crohn's disease under control. It can help reduce the risk of clinical relapse with moderate-certainty evidence. However, the evidence for loss of response, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events is very low‑certainty, so we can't draw conclusions about these outcomes.\n\nWe looked at how well infliximab works for people with Crohn's disease. We searched many databases and included studies that compared infliximab to a dummy treatment or another active medicine. Our main goal was to see if infliximab helps prevent clinical relapse, and we also looked at other outcomes like loss of response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to serious adverse events.\n\nInfliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than a dummy treatment (moderate‑certainty evidence). When used with purine analogues, infliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone (moderate‑certainty evidence). However, we can't say for sure about the effects of infliximab on loss of response, withdrawals due to adverse events, or total adverse events because the evidence is very low certainty.\n\nWe also looked at how infliximab compares to biosimilar medicines. There may be little or no difference in preventing clinical relapse, withdrawal due to adverse events, or total adverse events between infliximab and a biosimilar (low‑certainty evidence). Infliximab may lead to be more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar (low‑certainty evidence).\n\nTo improve our understanding of how infliximab works, we need to do more research on how it compares to other active therapies for maintaining remission. We also need to make sure that our studies have enough power and are reported clearly.",
