Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. There were limited data for the role of video-assistance or specific subgroups.\n- Future research should include more high-quality studies of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examination; assessment of inter-rater reliability across users; accuracy across different providers, specialties, and experience; and direct comparison with no HINTS or MRI to assess the effect on clinical care.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of AVS are unclear.\n\n**What is acute vestibular syndrome?**\n\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a specific type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, nystagmus, or unsteadiness. It can be due to peripheral or central causes. Clinicians can assess for the cause using risk factors, patient history, examination findings, or advanced imaging, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) examination is a three-part examination performed by clinicians to determine if AVS is due to a peripheral or central cause. This includes assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning a person’s head (head impulse), assessing the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and assessing whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of auditory function. Clinicians may use common treatments such as antihistamines, anticholinergics, or vestibular rehabilitation therapy to manage symptoms.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS.\n\n**Brief Summary**\n\nThe review aimed to assess the efficacy of intervention X in reducing outcome Y. The authors conducted a systematic search, screened studies against inclusion criteria, extracted data, and performed a meta‑analysis of randomized controlled trials, reporting pooled effect sizes and assessing risk of bias.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nFinding 1: The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations had good sensitivity and reasonable specificity for diagnosing a central cause for AVS in the emergency department when performed by trained clinicians. Effect size: Large effect. Certainty: High. Narrative: The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations probably cause a large reduction in the number of people with a central cause of AVS being misdiagnosed in the emergency department when performed by trained clinicians.\nFinding 2: The clinical HINTS examination was 94.0% sensitive and 86.9% specific (low‑certainty evidence). Effect size: Moderate effect. Certainty: Moderate. Narrative: The clinical HINTS examination probably reduces the number of people with a central cause of AVS being misdiagnosed in the emergency department, but the evidence is uncertain.\nFinding 3: The video‑assisted HINTS examination was 85.0% to 100% sensitive and 38.9% to 100% specific (very low‑certainty evidence). Effect size: Trivial, small, unimportant effect, or no effect. Certainty: Very low. Narrative: The video‑assisted HINTS examination may or may not make a difference in the number of people with a central cause of AVS being misdiagnosed in the emergency department, and the evidence is uncertain.\n\n**Main results:**\n\nFinding 1: The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations had good sensitivity and reasonable specificity for diagnosing a central cause for AVS in the emergency department when performed by trained clinicians.
