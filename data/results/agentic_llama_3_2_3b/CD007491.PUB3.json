It is used for conditions that can be safely managed outside the hospital but still need professional monitoring and support. By treating patients at home, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary hospital stays, which can be costly and stressful. However, many patients are still sent to hospital because clinicians may lack clear information about which conditions are suitable for home‑based care, leading to avoidable admissions.\n**Aims**\nThe purpose of this review is to evaluate whether Admission‑avoidance Hospital at Home is effective and affordable compared with traditional inpatient care. Specifically, we will examine if this model improves clinical outcomes, lowers health‑care costs, and increases patient satisfaction when patients receive treatment at home instead of in the hospital.\n\n**Methods:**\n**Search Strategy**\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared admission avoidance hospital‑at‑home with acute hospital inpatient care.\n**Evidence Synthesis**\nThe results from the identified studies were combined, and the confidence in the overall evidence was rated using appropriate assessment criteria.\n\n**Results:**\n**What did we find?**\nThink8: Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to patient health outcomes; may improve satisfaction; probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care; and probably decreases costs.\n**Main results:**\nThink8: Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to patient health outcomes; may improve satisfaction; probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care; and probably decreases costs.\n\n**Limitations:**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency:**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",
