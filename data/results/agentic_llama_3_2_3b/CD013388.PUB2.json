  "text": "**Heading**\nAgent halted after reaching maximum iterations\n\n**Key Messages**\n- The review found that cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities targeted in the intervention (CR is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible).\n- The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the use of CR in combination with other interventions, and the potential unwanted effects and costs of CR.\n\n**What is cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate dementia?**\nCognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review authors succinctly described the core actions, directly linking them to the research aims and presenting the study design in a concise manner.\n\n**What did we find?**\nCognitive rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate dementia helps improve their ability to manage everyday activities; evidence suggests it is a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to overcome everyday barriers caused by cognitive and functional difficulties.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\n...\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 19 October 2022 of search.**",
