  "text": "Personal mobile devices can help healthcare workers, but safety depends on proper use and policies.\n\nHealthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones for work-related tasks when official communication and information systems are lacking. This informal practice can fill gaps in service delivery but also raises concerns such as distractions, reduced productivity, data security risks, and increased organizational costs.\n\nThe quality of evidence for benefits and risks of informal mobile device use is moderate to high, but evidence on regulation and device type effects is lacking. More research is needed on long-term effects and strategies to support safe, effective informal mobile device use for all healthcare workers.\n\nHealthcare workers use personal mobile phones to support work due to resource gaps. They may feel pressure from colleagues/managers to use phones. Phone use can humanize care but may reinforce hierarchies and inequities. It can cause patient confidentiality issues. Informal phone use can fill system gaps but also weaken it.\n\nFindings indicate that informal mobile device use can enhance patient outcomes and efficiency, yet it may also compromise safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Healthcare organizations and policymakers should develop strategies to support beneficial uses while establishing regulations that protect patient safety and maintain quality of care.\n\nThe review was limited to qualitative and mixed-methods studies containing a qualitative component and focused solely on the views of healthcare workers, managers, and related professionals. Consequently, quantitative evidence and perspectives from other stakeholder groups were not captured.\n\nFuture research should examine how informal mobile device use influences patient outcomes and system performance, identify optimal approaches for supporting and regulating such practices, and explore mechanisms to ensure that patient safety and care quality are not compromised.\n\nBy finding their own informal solutions to workplace challenges, healthcare workers can be more efficient and responsive to the needs of patients, colleagues, and themselves. However, these solutions also have several drawbacks. Efforts to strengthen formal health systems should consider how to retain the benefits of informal solutions and reduce their negative effects.",
