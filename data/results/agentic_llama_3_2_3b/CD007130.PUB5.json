  "text": "**Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as good as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?**\n\n- Home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are similarly effective in improving clinical and health‑related quality of life outcomes after myocardial infarction, revascularisation, or heart failure.\n- No difference was observed between home‑ and centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation for primary outcomes up to 12 months, including total mortality and exercise capacity, and the cost per patient was similar.\n- Further research is needed to confirm long‑term effects and to evaluate safety and effectiveness of home‑based programmes for other cardiac conditions such as post‑valve surgery and atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease?\n\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It includes heart attacks, strokes, and other circulatory conditions. Cardiovascular disease is a major public health problem and can be prevented and treated with lifestyle changes and medication. Common treatments include medication to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and surgery to repair damaged heart tissue.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to compare the effect of home-based (which may include digital/telehealth interventions) and supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality and morbidity, exercise-capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease.\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of centre-based versus home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes in adults with heart disease across clinical and health‑related quality of life outcomes.\n\n**Methods**\n\nA systematic search identified randomised controlled trials that directly compared centre‑based and home‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adult heart disease patients. Twenty‑four eligible trials were pooled. Study quality, risk of bias, sample size and consistency were assessed to grade confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n\nMeta‑analysis showed that both programme types produced similar improvements in major clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, hospital readmission, exercise capacity) with no statistically significant difference. Health‑related quality of life scores were modestly higher for centre‑based programmes, but the effect size was small and confidence was low due to heterogeneity among trials.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCentre‑based and home‑based cardiac rehabilitation deliver comparable clinical benefits for adults with heart disease. While centre‑based care may provide a slight advantage in quality‑of‑life measures, the overall evidence suggests that home‑based programmes are a viable alternative, especially when access to centre‑based services is limited.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with a history of acute myocardial infarction, revascularisation, or heart failure. The studies were conducted in various settings; most were short, only three reported outcomes beyond 12 months; funding sources: not reported; interventions: home-based (± digital/telehealth) and supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation; outcomes: no significant difference in health-related quality of life up to 24 months between home- and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\n**Main results: No significant difference**\n\nHome-based cardiac rehabilitation (including digital/telehealth options) is not inferior or superior to centre-based programmes. The evidence shows no significant differences between the two approaches in mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, or modification of cardiac risk factors up to 24 months, and the per-patient cost is similar.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding) and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\n\nAll referenced evidence is current as of the latest available data up to October 7, 2025.",
