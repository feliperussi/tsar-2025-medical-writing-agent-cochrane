  "text": "# Colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events\n\n**Key messages**\n- Colchicine may lower all‑cause mortality compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhea compared with placebo or usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Because the evidence is of very low certainty and the studies are small, we cannot tell if colchicine prevents heart attacks or strokes; more robust trials are needed.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a condition where fatty deposits build up in artery walls and cause blockages. It is the leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic inflammation often makes ACVD worse. Colchicine is an inexpensive anti‑inflammatory drug that has been used for centuries, but we do not know whether it can prevent ACVD in people who have not yet had a heart event.\n\n**What did the researchers aim to discover?**\nWe set out to assess the benefits and harms of colchicine when it is used to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.\n\n**What did we find?**\nCurrent evidence is very uncertain. Some small studies suggest colchicine may reduce all‑cause death compared with placebo, but the data are inconclusive. There is little or no clear effect on non‑fatal heart attacks or strokes, and the certainty is low. Colchicine appears to increase the risk of diarrhea, though this finding also rests on uncertain evidence. When compared with methotrexate, colchicine shows little or no difference in mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Overall, the existing studies are limited and small.\n\n**What are the limitations?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can bias results.\n\n**How current is the evidence?**\nThe evidence we reviewed is up to date as of May 31 2023.\n\n**What next?**\nWe need larger, well‑designed trials to determine whether colchicine is truly beneficial or harmful for primary cardiovascular prevention.",
