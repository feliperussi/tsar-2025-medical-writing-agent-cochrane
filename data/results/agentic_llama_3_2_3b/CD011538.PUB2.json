There is no clear evidence that education support improves school engagement or academic achievement in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions are unclear.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as educational support interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of children and adolescents with different types of chronic health conditions, and unwanted effects and costs associated with these interventions.\n\n**Background**\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have a significant impact on their education, well‑being, and overall health. These conditions are long‑lasting and rarely cured, often limiting a child's ability to attend school regularly. Regular school attendance is essential for academic progress, social skill development, and general well‑being. When chronic illness leads to absenteeism, school engagement may suffer, resulting in poorer academic achievement, reduced social‑emotional functioning, and limited future career options.\n\n**Aims**\nThe purpose of this review is to describe the range of educational support interventions that are provided to children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, identified relevant studies, and applied the predefined critical rules to assess study designs. They extracted core actions, synthesized findings across randomized and observational studies, and presented conclusions that directly address the review’s objectives.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 4 randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease‑specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The studies were conducted in eight electronic databases and five grey literature trials registers and databases. The interventions were education support services, and the outcomes were school engagement and academic achievement.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 25, 2021 of search.\n\n**Authors’ Conclusions**\nThis review has demonstrated the infancy of quality research on the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. At best, we can say that we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either academic achievement or school engagement. Of the secondary outcomes, we are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school, or school re‑entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self‑esteem. Given the current state of the evidence of the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, we highlight some important implications for future research in this field to strengthen the evidence that can inform effective practice and policy.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have profound impacts on education, well‑being, and health. These conditions are described as non‑communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and rarely cured completely. Due to variations in the definition of chronic health conditions and how they are measured, prevalence estimates vary considerably and have been reported to be as high as 44% in children and adolescents. Of young people with a chronic health condition, an estimated 5% are affected by severe conditions characterized by limitations to daily activities impacting their ability to attend school. School attendance is important for academic and social skill development as well as well‑being. When children and adolescents are absent from school due to a chronic health condition, school engagement can be affected. Disengagement from school is associated with poorer academic achievement, social‑emotional functioning, and career choices. Education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions aim to prevent disengagement from school, education, and learning during periods where their illness caused them to miss school. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of educational support interventions at improving school engagement and educational/learning outcomes for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n\n**Search methods**\nWe searched eight electronic databases which span the health/medical, social sciences, and education disciplines between 18 and 25 January 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts: ASSIA (ProQuest), and PubMed (from 2019). We also searched five grey literature trials registers and databases between 8 and 12 February 2021 to identify additional published and unpublished studies, theses, and conference abstracts, as well as snowballing reference lists of included studies.\n\n**Selection criteria**\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‑and‑after studies, and interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Other inclusion criteria were: participants – must include children or adolescents (aged four to 18 years) with a chronic health condition, intervention – must include educational support, outcomes – must report the primary outcomes (i.e., school engagement or academic achievement) or secondary outcomes (i.e., quality of life, transition to school/school re‑entry, mental health or adverse outcomes).\n\n**Data collection and analysis**\nTwo people independently screened titles and abstracts, and full‑text articles, to identify included studies. Where disagreements arose between reviewers, the two reviewers discussed the discrepancy. If resolution was unable to be achieved, the issues were discussed with a senior reviewer to resolve the matter. We extracted study characteristic data and risk of bias data from the full texts of included studies using a data extraction form before entering the information into Review Manager 5.4.1. Two people independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias of individual studies, and undertook GRADE assessments of the quality of the evidence.\n\n**Main results**\nThe database searches identified 14,202 titles and abstracts. Grey literature and reference list searches did not identify any additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. One hundred and twelve full‑text studies were assessed for eligibility, of which four studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease‑specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nThere was evidence that education support improved school engagement with three of four studies favouring the intervention. Three studies measured academic achievement but only two studies provided effect estimates. Based on the vote‑counting method, we found contradictory results from the studies: one study showed a positive direction of effect and the other study showed a negative direction of effect. One study measured transition back to school and found a positive impact of education support favouring the intervention (SMD 0.18, 95% CI –0.46 to 0.96, no P value reported). The result came from a single study with a small sample size (n= 30), and produced a confidence interval that indicated the possibility of a very small or no effect. The overall certainty of evidence for these three outcomes was judged to be ‘very low’.\n\nTwo of four",
