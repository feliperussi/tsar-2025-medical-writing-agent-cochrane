It can be caused by the surgery itself, as well as by the removal of lymph nodes and other tissues. Pain can be severe and may last for several weeks or even months after surgery. It can also affect a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and enjoy life. Regional analgesia techniques are considered integral to postoperative pain management, but are not without risks. Common treatments for postoperative pain include pain medication, physical therapy, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture and massage.\n- **What did the authors want to find out?** The authors wanted to assess the analgesic benefits and harms of different regional analgesia techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications.\n- **Methods:** The review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions for improving health outcomes. Authors systematically identified relevant literature, applied inclusion criteria, extracted data, and performed a synthesis of the evidence. They screened records, evaluated study quality, and summarized results, highlighting overall trends without detailing individual study designs.\n- **Results:** In the included studies, pectoral nerve block (PEC) was probably slightly more effective than paravertebral block (PVB) for reducing postoperative pain at rest at 2 hours and 24 hours, although the differences were smaller than the minimal clinically important difference. PEC may also produce a large reduction in pain during movement at 2 hours, but the evidence is low-certainty. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) showed similar effectiveness to PVB for most pain outcomes. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, hypotension, nerve injury, vascular puncture, bleeding, infection, or pneumothorax were reported.\n- **Limitations:** We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n- **Currency:** The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",
