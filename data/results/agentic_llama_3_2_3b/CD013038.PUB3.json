  "text": "**Does adding the smell and taste of milk to preterm babies' tube feeds help them start eating solid foods sooner?**\n\nWe investigated whether giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube can help them start eating solid foods sooner.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nPreterm babies (born before 37 weeks' gestation) often face difficulties with oral feeding due to their immaturity. As a result, they may require initial nutrition through orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, feeding intolerance is common, leading to delays in attaining full enteral and sucking feeds, which can prolong hospital stays and nutritional support needs.\n\n**What are the common treatments?**\n\nCommon treatments for preterm babies include orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. Smell and taste play a crucial role in activating physiological pre-absorptive processes that contribute to food digestion and absorption. However, during tube feeding, milk bypasses the nasal and oral cavities, limiting exposure to the smell and taste of milk.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe aimed to investigate whether exposure to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula administered with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nOur study found that giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube probably has little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds, time to reach full enteral feeds, duration of parenteral nutrition, safety outcomes (including adverse effects, necrotising enterocolitis, and late infection), and risk of late infection. The certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to moderate, and no data were available for feeding intolerance.\n\n**What are the limitations of our study?**\n\nOur study had some limitations. The studies we looked at were small, and some of them didn't have clear randomization or blinding. This means that we can't be sure that the results are accurate.\n\n**What does this mean for preterm babies?**\n\nOur study suggests that giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube may not be helpful in getting them to start eating solid foods sooner. However, more research is needed to confirm this. We also need to find ways to help preterm babies who have trouble with feeding and staying in the hospital for a longer time.\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- Giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube probably has little to no effect on whether they can start eating solid foods sooner.\n- There was no clear difference between giving them the smell and taste of milk and not giving them the smell and taste of milk on safety outcomes.\n- More research is needed to confirm these findings and to find ways to help preterm babies who have trouble with feeding and staying in the hospital for a longer time.",
