They raise knowledge by about 12 points on a 0‑100 scale and make risk understanding more accurate.\n- Decision aids do not increase feelings of regret and they change appointment length only a little – they may shave a few minutes off a visit if used beforehand, or add about one to two minutes if used during the visit.\n- More research is needed on long‑term outcomes such as staying with the chosen option, health‑care costs and how different patient groups respond.\n\nWhy do people need help making health decisions?\nEvery day adults face choices about treatments or screening tests – for example, starting blood‑pressure medicine, getting a colon‑cancer screen, or having joint‑replacement surgery. These choices often involve several options, each with its own benefits, possible harms and chances of success. Most people do not receive clear, easy‑to‑understand information, and they may not know how the outcomes fit with their own values. Decision aids are tools – such as booklets, videos or interactive websites – that make the choice explicit, give evidence‑based facts about each option and help people think about what matters most to them. By doing this, we aim to support patients in making informed, values‑congruent choices (choices that line up with what they personally consider important).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using patient decision aids improves the way decisions are made compared with usual care (such as generic pamphlets or no extra information). Specifically, we asked whether decision aids help adults:\n- understand the options better (increase knowledge);\n- have a more accurate sense of the risks and benefits (accurate risk perception);\n- feel clearer about their own values and preferences (values‑congruent choice);\n- take a more active role in discussions with their clinician (less passive, clinician‑controlled decisions);\n- experience less uncertainty or conflict about the decision (lower decisional conflict);\n- avoid feeling regret after the choice is made (decision regret).\nWe also looked at other outcomes such as consultation length, adherence to the chosen option and any impact on the health‑care system.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that compared patient decision aids with usual care for adults facing treatment or screening choices. Two reviewers screened each citation, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results using standard statistical methods and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 209 trials involving 107,698 adults making a wide range of health‑related decisions. All trials compared decision aids – tools that make the decision explicit, give evidence‑based information and help clarify what matters most – with usual care, which could be general information, risk assessments, consumer‑friendly guideline summaries, unrelated placebo information or no intervention.\nThe evidence suggests that decision aids probably increase the chance that people choose options that match their informed values. They produce a large increase in knowledge (about 12 points on a 0‑100 scale) and a large improvement in how accurately people understand their risks. They also reduce feelings of being uninformed, lower decisional conflict and decrease the proportion of people who remain passive in decision‑making. Decision aids make little or no difference to decision regret or to the length of a consultation when used beforehand, and they probably add only about one to two minutes when used during a consultation.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Some participants knew which group they were in, and not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. This uncertainty limits how strongly we can draw conclusions.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence up to March 2022.",
