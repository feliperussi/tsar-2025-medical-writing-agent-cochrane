These emotional problems are common and can lower quality of life. Standard care usually includes medicines, counselling, and support groups, but many patients continue to struggle.\n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy and how might it help?\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy combines a supervised dose of a psychedelic drug with therapeutic support. We use classic psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) or MDMA. The process includes preparation sessions, a guided experience while the drug is active, and follow‑up meetings to help the person make sense of what they felt. Researchers think the intense, often spiritual experience can shift thinking patterns and emotions, potentially easing anxiety, depression, and existential distress. The drugs are illegal in most countries and can cause short‑term side‑effects such as a temporary rise in blood pressure, nausea, or mild anxiety.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy is effective and safe for people with life‑threatening illnesses. Specifically, we compared the therapy with placebo or other active treatments (for example, antidepressants) to see if it reduces anxiety, depression, and existential distress, and we recorded any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, and reference lists up to 30 March 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared psychedelic‑assisted therapy with placebo or other treatments in adults with life‑threatening illnesses. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 149 adults (we analysed data from 140 participants). Participants were aged 36–64 years, and most had cancer. The trials took place in outpatient settings in the United States and Switzerland and were funded by organisations that support psychedelic research.\n\n- Classic psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) probably reduced anxiety and may have produced a small reduction in depression. Only one small study measured existential distress, so we remain uncertain about that outcome.\n- No serious adverse events occurred in any trial. Common mild effects included a temporary rise in blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, or emotional upset.\n- Evidence for MDMA is very uncertain. The single small trial did not show a clear benefit for anxiety or depression, and side‑effects such as anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headache were reported.\nOverall, we judged the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. The low certainty reflects the small sample sizes, possible unblinding of participants, and imprecision of the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe cannot be confident in the results because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence outcomes. Follow‑up periods were short, and the trials did not test all possible psychedelic agents or a wide range of serious illnesses.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to 30 March 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",
