The tiny needle holes they create can leak blood. If bleeding is not quickly controlled (hemostasis), the patient may lose more blood, the operation may take longer, and complications can arise after surgery. Traditional ways to stop bleeding include pressing on the site, using gauze‑like materials, or adjusting medicines that affect clotting.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a liquid or gel that a surgeon applies directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Surgeons use sealants as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop bleeding well enough. Types include fibrin‑based sealants (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants (man‑made materials).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. We looked at time to stop bleeding, the chance that bleeding control fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with standard techniques such as manual compression or oxidized cellulose. We combined the findings and used the GRADE approach to judge our confidence in each result.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that together enrolled 2,376 participants. All trials compared sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes. The abstract does not report how long participants were followed, the trials’ funding sources, participants’ ages, genders, disease severity, or the countries where the studies took place.\n\nWhat are the main results for time to stop bleeding?\nSealants probably reduce the time needed to stop bleeding, cutting the waiting period by about four minutes (≈230 seconds). It is very uncertain whether sealants also reduce the chance that bleeding control fails. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to intra‑operative blood loss, total operation time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies did not blind participants or clinicians, some data were missing, the participants and methods varied, the trials were small, and the limited number of studies may over‑estimate benefits.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
