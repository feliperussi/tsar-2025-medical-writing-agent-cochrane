They will compare dexmedetomidine with drugs such as fentanyl, morphine, or a mix of ketamine and dexmedetomidine. These studies may soon give data on how well the medicine works and its safety.\n- Because evidence is missing, future research must include well‑designed randomised trials that look at short‑term benefits (calming and pain relief) and possible harms (low blood pressure, death, and long‑term brain development) before dexmedetomidine can be recommended for routine use.\n\nWhy is keeping newborns comfortable and calm a challenge when they need a breathing machine?\nSome newborn babies cannot breathe on their own and need a machine called a ventilator. While on the ventilator they often feel pain or become restless. Doctors give medicines to keep them calm (sedation) and free from pain (analgesia). The most common medicines are opioids such as morphine, which can lower heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. Dexmedetomidine is a different type of medicine that works on a special part of the nervous system called the alpha‑2 receptor (a switch that reduces stress) and usually does not change heart rate or blood pressure much. It is being used more often even though it is not officially approved for newborns.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about dexmedetomidine?\nWe wanted to know whether dexmedetomidine works better, the same, or worse than other medicines (including other non‑opioid drugs, opioids, or no drug) for keeping newborns on ventilators comfortable and calm. We also wanted to see whether it causes any safety problems such as low blood pressure, death, or long‑term effects on brain development.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and two trial registries for randomised trials that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedation or pain‑relief options, or with placebo, in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation. We followed standard Cochrane methods to combine any results and to rate the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies, so no babies were enrolled in a trial that met our criteria. Because of this we have no information about study length, funding, the babies’ ages or health status, where the studies would have taken place, or which medicines were compared. We did identify four ongoing trials, but they were not yet ready for inclusion, so we could not use their data.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe cannot be confident about any conclusions because there are no completed studies that meet our criteria. The lack of data means we do not know the true benefits or harms of dexmedetomidine for this group.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur search covered studies and trial registrations up to September 2023. Any research published after that date is not included in this summary.",
