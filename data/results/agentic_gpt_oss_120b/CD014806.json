The reduction is about 1.7 points on the PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) scale at 30 seconds, 2.1 points at 60 seconds, and roughly 2 points on the NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale) right after the prick.\n- Sucrose does not provide much more relief than other simple options such as glucose solution, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin holding. The evidence about any extra benefit over a pacifier (non‑nutritive sucking) or breastfeeding is uncertain.\n- No important side effects were reported, but many comparisons come from small or low‑quality trials, so more research is needed.\n\nWhy is pain from heel‑lance procedures a concern for newborn babies?\nWhen a baby is born, clinicians often need a tiny drop of blood to check for health problems. They obtain this sample by quickly pricking the baby’s heel – a test called a heel‑lance. Even though the prick is small, it can cause noticeable pain and distress in both full‑term and pre‑term infants. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby’s comfort, sleep, and later pain responses. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, we look for safe ways to calm them during these routine tests. One common approach is to give a small amount of sweet liquid, such as sucrose (table sugar), which is thought to have a soothing effect.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about using sucrose for pain relief?\nWe wanted to know whether giving sucrose to newborns reduces the pain they feel during a heel‑lance. We compared sucrose with water or no treatment, a pacifier (non‑nutritive sucking), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, music, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking (gentle holding) and skin‑to‑skin care. We examined immediate pain scores measured a few seconds after the prick and any longer‑term effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases up to February 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared sucrose with any of the above alternatives in newborns undergoing heel‑lance. We combined the results using standard Cochrane methods and judged our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 55 trials with 6,273 newborn babies (both full‑term and pre‑term). Compared with giving no sweet solution, sucrose probably reduces pain scores slightly: about 1.7 points lower on the PIPP scale at 30 seconds, 2.1 points lower at 60 seconds, and roughly 2 points lower on the NIPS scale right after the prick. We found no clear benefit of sucrose over a pacifier, sucrose + pacifier, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk or skin‑to‑skin care. No important side effects were reported in any study.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these findings because the studies involved different types of babies, used varied methods and were often very small. This variability reduces the certainty of the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to the February 2022 search.",
