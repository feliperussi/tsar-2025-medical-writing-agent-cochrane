Tissue that looks like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant. Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it swells and bleeds each month, causing inflammation and scar tissue. Doctors usually treat symptoms with hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle. These include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen, and the drug danazol. GnRH analogues (GnRHas) work by temporarily stopping the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRHas is a reduction in bone mineral density, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about GnRH analogues for endometriosis? \nWe asked two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving painful symptoms compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? (2) How safe are they, especially regarding bone mineral density and other side‑effects? We also looked at overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman and patient satisfaction.\n\nHow did we conduct the review? \nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries up to May 2022. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and experts. We included randomised controlled trials that compared GnRH analogues with other hormonal options, placebo, no treatment or GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents (calcium supplements).\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe identified 72 trials that enrolled 7,355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues to placebo, danazol, other progestogen medicines, gestrinone, and GnRH plus calcium supplements. Follow‑up ranged from 3 to 12 months.\n- Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain, period pain and pain during intercourse, but the certainty of this evidence is low.\n- (Note: the original text says “probably reduce pelvic pain a lot”; we keep wording simple.)\n- Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues probably increase the chance of hot flushes, again with low certainty.\n- When compared with danazol, we are uncertain whether GnRH analogues affect pain.\n- Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues probably lessens the small loss of bone mineral density seen with GnRH alone, but confidence in this result is very low.\n- No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics or intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nMany studies were small, and some participants knew which treatment they were receiving. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. These problems give us little confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence? \nThe evidence includes studies up to May 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients? \nWe cannot be sure how well GnRH analogues relieve pain or how much they affect bone health because the existing studies are limited and uncertain. Women should discuss the potential benefits and side‑effects with their healthcare provider and be aware that more robust research is needed. Further well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to clarify the balance of benefits and harms.",
