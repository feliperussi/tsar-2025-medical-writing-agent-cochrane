  "text": "Do digital health tools (like apps, wearables, text messages, video‑game exercise, or telehealth) help children and teenagers lose weight compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages:\n- Adding digital tools to usual care probably reduces body‑fat a little (about 2‑3%) in children and teenagers with obesity, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Using digital tools on their own did not show a clear benefit for weight‑related outcomes, and studies did not report side‑effects.\n- We need larger, longer‑term studies that track safety and examine different ages, genders and ethnic groups.\n\nWhy is childhood obesity a public health problem?\nBeing (having) overweight or obese as a child or teenager is a growing worldwide issue. In 2016 more than 340 million young people aged 5‑19 had excess weight. Carrying extra body fat at a young age raises the chance of developing long‑term illnesses such as type‑2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers later in life. It can also affect a child’s physical comfort, mental well‑being and quality of life.\n\nWhat are the usual ways to help children lose weight?\nTraditional (conventional) care usually offers advice on healthier eating, structured diet plans and programmes that encourage more physical activity. These may be delivered through face‑to‑face counselling, school‑based lessons or printed materials and do not use any digital technology.\n\nWhat are digital health interventions?\nDigital health interventions are tools that use technology to support health goals. In obesity they can include:\n- Wearable or implantable devices that track activity or heart rate\n- Web‑based programmes or mobile apps that give diet and exercise guidance\n- Text‑message reminders or coaching\n- “Exergaming” (active video games that require movement)\n- Telehealth sessions where clinicians meet patients online.\nThese tools can be used together with conventional care or on their own.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether digital health tools help children and adolescents manage obesity. Specifically we compared:\n1. Digital tools **plus** conventional care versus conventional care alone, and\n2. Digital tools **alone** versus conventional care alone.\nWe looked at outcomes such as body‑fat, weight, physical activity, well‑being and any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched four major databases and two trial registers for randomised controlled trials that tested digital tools for obesity in children (0‑9 years) and adolescents (10‑19 years). The last search was on 14 April 2025. We found 15 trials that included 911 participants. Ten trials enrolled only 10‑19‑year‑olds; five trials also included younger children (0‑9 years). The studies were carried out in ten countries and used wearables, web platforms, text messages, apps, exergaming or telehealth. Eight trials added a digital tool to usual care, and seven used a digital tool alone. Two reviewers extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, a system that tells us how confident we can be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nDigital tools added to usual care probably lower body‑fat slightly (average reduction about 2‑3%). The effect on other outcomes such as weight, activity or well‑being was unclear. When digital tools were used alone, we did not see a clear benefit for any outcome. No study reported adverse‑event data, so we cannot comment on safety.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence because the trials were small, short‑term and did not report participants’ gender, ethnicity or side‑effects. This means the evidence does not cover all people, interventions or outcomes we are interested in.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to 14 April 2025.",
