When the hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognising faces or driving difficult. A “large” macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin hair). Large holes are harder for the eye to close on their own and are less likely to respond fully to standard surgery.\n\nWhat are the current surgical treatments for large macular holes?\nThe most common operation is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), where the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous humour through tiny side‑incisions. During PPV the internal limiting membrane (ILM) – a thin, transparent layer on the back of the retina – is usually peeled away. ILM peeling helps the hole close and improves visual outcomes, and it is the standard of care. For large holes, the success rate of conventional peeling is lower. An alternative is the inverted ILM flap technique, in which the surgeon creates a small flap of ILM, flips it over and places it on the hole, acting like a biological patch that may promote better closure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared PPV with conventional ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap in eyes with large macular holes (idiopathic, traumatic or myopic). We examined whether the flap improves overall hole closure, type 1 closure (a complete seal with no remaining defect), and best‑corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured with a logMAR chart (a chart that measures how clearly you can see; lower numbers mean sharper vision). We also looked at safety outcomes such as postoperative retinal detachment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registries up to 12 December 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared the two techniques in eyes with large macular holes. We combined the results for BCVA and hole‑ and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four randomised trials involving 285 eyes of 275 participants. Most participants were women (≈63 %) and were aged 59–66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for 3–12 months.\n– Hole closure: We found that the inverted flap probably increases the chance that the hole closes – about 10 more closures per 100 eyes – and probably raises the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly 30 per 100 eyes.\n– Vision: At three months or later, the flap may improve BCVA by about 0.17 logMAR units (roughly one line on an eye chart). Evidence for a benefit at one month is uncertain.\n– Safety: No serious postoperative harms, such as retinal detachment, were reported in the trials.\nThe certainty of the evidence was moderate for hole‑closure outcomes and low to very low for visual‑acuity outcomes because the trials were small, not blinded and showed some variability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because participants and surgeons likely knew which technique was used, the trials enrolled a few participants, and not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, such as long‑term visual changes.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nThe inverted ILM flap technique appears to help large macular holes close more often and may lead to better vision after several months, without clear safety concerns. However, the evidence is based on a small number of modest‑quality studies, so we cannot be certain of the size of the benefit. Clinicians should discuss the potential advantages and the uncertainty with patients when choosing a surgical approach.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nOur search was completed on 12 December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nHow should future research proceed?\nFuture studies should recruit larger numbers of participants, use masking where possible, report outcomes consistently (including BCVA changes and any adverse events), and follow patients for at least a year. Using standard logMAR charts for vision measurement will help compare results across studies.",
