Adding a cream to a pessary may lower vaginal side‑effects, and adding a cream to surgery may lower postoperative urinary‑tract infections, but both findings are very uncertain.\n- Future research needs larger, well‑designed trials that test estrogen alone and in combination with pelvic‑floor exercises, pessaries, or surgery, and that report side‑effects and cost‑effectiveness.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for post‑menopausal women?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina because the supporting muscles and tissues become weak. About half of women over 50 who have given birth experience POP, and risk increases with age, more births, and higher body weight. POP can cause a feeling of pressure, trouble urinating or having bowel movements, and a visible or palpable bulge, all of which can affect daily life and quality of life.\nAfter menopause, estrogen levels fall, which can make vaginal tissues and surrounding muscles less resilient. Clinicians sometimes offer estrogen therapy – a cream applied inside the vagina (topical) or a pill taken by mouth (systemic) – hoping it will improve tissue quality and reduce symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether local or systemic estrogen therapy helps relieve POP symptoms in post‑menopausal women and whether it causes any harms. We also examined how estrogen works when combined with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and we looked for any information on cost‑effectiveness.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register up to June 2022, which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, trial registers, and hand‑searched journals and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 1,002 post‑menopausal women with any grade of POP. All trials tested estrogen only when it was added to another treatment: three trials compared a pessary plus topical estrogen cream with a pessary alone, and eleven trials compared surgery plus cream with surgery alone. No trial evaluated estrogen by itself.\nWe found that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether adding estrogen improves or harms POP symptoms. Adding a cream to a pessary may reduce vaginal side‑effects slightly, and adding a cream to surgery may reduce postoperative urinary‑tract infections slightly, but both results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small and had a high risk of bias – meaning they likely contained errors such as lack of blinding that could affect the results. Participants often knew which treatment they received, and several trials did not report all outcomes we wanted. Consequently, confidence in the findings is low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in June 2022.",
