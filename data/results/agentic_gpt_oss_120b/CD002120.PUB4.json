It is very common and is a leading cause of pain, missed work or school days, and reduced quality of life for women of reproductive age. The usual first‑line treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs – pain‑relieving medicines such as ibuprofen). Many women also use combined oral contraceptive pills because they can suppress ovulation and stabilise hormone levels, which may lessen pain.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well combined oral contraceptive pills work for relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhoea and what side‑effects they cause. Specifically, we compared the benefits (pain reduction and improvement) and harms (irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea, and any serious adverse events) of the pills against placebo, no treatment, other pill regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched the literature up to March 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other contraceptives, or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 21 trials with a total of 3,723 women who had primary dysmenorrhoea confirmed by clinical examination or ultrasound. The trials compared the pills with placebo or no treatment (11 trials), with other pill regimens or dosages (8 trials), with a mixed pill‑placebo design (1 trial), and with NSAIDs (1 trial). The studies did not report long‑term outcomes, participant age, pain severity, funding sources, or geographic settings, and no trial evaluated adolescents or other specific sub‑populations.\n\nWhat are the effects of combined oral contraceptives on pain and side‑effects?\n- The pills probably reduce menstrual pain. \n- They cause a large increase in irregular bleeding: if about 1 in 5 women would have irregular bleeding without the pill, using the pill raises this to roughly 4 in 10.\n- The pills probably increase the chance of headaches and nausea slightly, and they probably increase the overall chance of any side‑effect slightly.\n- They may reduce the need for extra pain medication and may reduce days off work, but the evidence for these benefits is uncertain.\n- Continuous use (no break) may reduce pain more than the standard cyclic regimens, although the evidence is of low certainty.\n- We are uncertain whether the pills affect weight or cause serious adverse events.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, but some studies may have been unblinded, used different populations or delivery methods, and were small. Because of these issues, the results are less certain.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",
