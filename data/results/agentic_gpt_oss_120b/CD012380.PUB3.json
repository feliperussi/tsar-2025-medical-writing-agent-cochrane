  "text": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages –\n- The current evidence does not let us say whether blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors protect kidney health in sickle cell disease.\n- Small studies suggest hydroxyurea may improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine and ACE inhibitors may lower protein loss in the urine, but overall benefits and harms remain uncertain and no serious side‑effects were reported.\n- No randomised trials examined blood transfusions for kidney protection; the few hydroxyurea and ACE‑inhibitor trials were short, involved few participants, and did not assess quality of life or death, so larger, longer‑term studies are needed.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Misshapen red cells can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, organ damage, lung problems, and a shorter life expectancy. The kidneys are often affected.\nKidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can appear early, even in children, as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria) or as reduced function of the kidney’s filtering units (the glomeruli). Over time this can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the kidneys work poorly for at least three months, and eventually to end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy may reach this stage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or any combination of these can prevent or slow kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, and whether the treatments are safe for this purpose.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared any of the listed interventions with a placebo or usual care. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our searches were completed in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9 to 18 months. Hydroxyurea may help the kidney concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain whether it improves the glomerular filtration rate (a test of kidney filtering ability). The trial did not show clear effects on acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation, and no serious side‑effects were reported.\n- A second trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Over six months the study did not show a clear reduction in protein loss or preservation of kidney function. No serious side‑effects were reported.\n- A third trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years who also had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. After one month both groups showed a drop in protein loss, making it unclear whether lisinopril had any specific benefit. No serious side‑effects were reported.\nNo trial examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney protection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low to very low confidence in the findings. Some participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies did not report important outcomes such as quality of life or death, and the evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatment combinations. All trials were small, which limits reliability.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with sickle cell disease?\nAt present we cannot say that hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or blood transfusions reliably protect kidney health in SCD. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the uncertainty and the need for larger, longer‑term trials before these treatments can be recommended for kidney protection.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nOur search was completed in 2023 and no new randomised trials on these interventions and kidney outcomes have been published since then.",
