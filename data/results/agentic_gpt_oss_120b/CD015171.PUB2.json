These symptoms can be frightening and can make everyday activities such as driving, working or enjoying hobbies very difficult. The exact cause is unknown, so doctors do not have a single cure. Instead, they often try medicines taken by mouth or injection – called systemic medicines – that work throughout the whole body to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks. Common medicines include betahistine (thought to improve blood flow in the inner ear), diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral drugs (which target viruses that might be involved) and corticosteroids (anti‑inflammatory medicines).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these systemic medicines actually help people with Ménière’s disease. We compared each medicine with a placebo (a harmless pill that looks the same but has no active ingredient) or with no treatment. We asked three questions: 1) Do the medicines reduce the number of vertigo attacks or make them less severe? 2) Do they cause serious side‑effects? 3) How do they affect hearing loss, tinnitus, quality of life and other harms?\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials – studies that randomly assign participants to a medicine or a placebo – that compared systemic medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. We included only trials that followed participants for at least three months. Two reviewers extracted the data and we used standard Cochrane methods to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified ten trials that together involved 848 adults with Ménière’s disease. The trials compared betahistine (seven trials, 548 participants), diuretics (two trials, 300 participants), an antiviral (one trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (one trial, 16 participants) with placebo or no treatment. No study reported participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, country or funding source.\nWe found that the evidence is very uncertain whether any of these medicines improve how often vertigo attacks happen, how severe they are, hearing loss, tinnitus or quality of life. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported, so we cannot tell whether the medicines cause harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies were small, used different ways of delivering the medicines and measured outcomes at different times. This makes the evidence less reliable and less applicable to all people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to September 2022, the date of our last search.",
