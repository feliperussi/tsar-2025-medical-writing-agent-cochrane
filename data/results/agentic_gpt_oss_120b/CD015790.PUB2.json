The evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- Most studies involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration; no studies included people with combined hearing and vision loss (dual‑sensory impairment).\n- Future research should use more sensitive quality‑of‑life measures, include a broader range of participants, and follow people for longer periods to determine whether self‑management programs can provide real benefits.\n\nWhy is visual impairment a health concern and what help is usually offered?\nSeeing problems in everyday life – such as reading, recognizing faces, or moving around safely – become harder for many adults because eye diseases reduce vision. Visual impairment affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to loss of independence, lower mood, and a decline in overall well‑being. Typical support includes glasses, magnifiers, or other optical aids, and low‑vision rehabilitation, which provides specialised training and devices to help people continue daily activities despite reduced sight.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether self‑management programmes, which teach people skills to manage their own condition and stay active, improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared participants in these programmes with people who received usual care or were placed on a waiting list, focusing on health‑related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision‑related quality of life (VRQoL) and on any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched several databases and trial registries up to 19 May 2024 for randomised controlled trials that compared multifaceted self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with acquired visual impairment. We combined the results using meta‑analysis where possible and assessed our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 20 parallel‑group trials that enrolled 3,151 adults (average age 60–84 years). Most participants had age‑related macular degeneration. The trials were conducted in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America and compared self‑management programmes with wait‑list or active controls such as usual care, optical aids, or low‑vision rehabilitation. Follow‑up ranged from 6 to 24 months. Our analysis shows that self‑management programmes probably make little or no difference to overall HRQoL, to VRQoL, or to the risk of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and varied in participants and how the programmes were delivered.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to May 2024.",
