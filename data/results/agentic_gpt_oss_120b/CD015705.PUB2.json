To keep patients safe and get their jobs done, we turn to the phones and tablets we already own. By calling, texting or using apps on personal devices we can quickly get advice, arrange appointments or share urgent information. This makes care more flexible, personal and responsive – for example, a nurse can call a doctor directly instead of waiting for a slow pager.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to explore what health‑care workers, managers and other professionals think and do when they use personal mobile phones or other devices to support their work. Specifically, we gathered qualitative evidence about experiences, motivations, benefits and challenges of these informal, innovative uses of mobile technology across different countries and health‑care settings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for studies published since 2008, and we also did citation searches and contacted authors for extra data. We included qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that looked at workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile‑device use. We then extracted the data, performed a thematic synthesis, and used the GRADE‑CERQual approach to judge how reliable each finding is.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and worker cadres.\nThe evidence suggests that using personal phones makes work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Staff also say it strengthens relationships with patients and colleagues. At the same time, personal device use adds personal costs for workers – especially those with lower pay – and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality (privacy). It may also create inequities because some staff can afford devices and airtime while others cannot. The practice also creates a parallel “shadow IT” system – technology that operates outside the official health‑information system and is therefore not recorded.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because all the included work was qualitative and varied in setting and quality. The review does not give detailed information about the number, age or gender of participants, nor about funding or study duration.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022, the date of our most recent database search.\n\nWhat does this mean for us?\nWe see that informal use of personal devices can help health‑care workers deliver care that is more human‑centred and timely. However, the practice can place financial burdens on staff, threaten patient privacy and reinforce existing inequalities. Future research should explore how formal health‑system solutions can keep the advantages while reducing costs, privacy risks and distractions. Policies should support safe, equitable integration of personal technology into routine care. We use the term “street‑level bureaucrat” to describe front‑line staff who must deliver services with limited resources and often create their own solutions to fill gaps in the system.",
