The fluid blocks sound from reaching the inner ear, causing hearing loss. In young children, reduced hearing can lead to behavioural problems, delayed language development and difficulties at school. OME is common in early childhood, so clinicians often start with watchful waiting, medicines, surgery (tiny ventilation tubes) or mechanical methods that help the ear drain.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about autoinflation?\nWe wanted to know whether autoinflation – a self‑administered technique where the child blows air into a nasal balloon or similar device – is effective and safe for treating OME. Specifically, we looked at hearing, ear‑related quality of life, pain or distress, and whether fluid remains in the ear. We also recorded any harms such as ear pain or eardrum damage.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and other sources for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials up to 20 January 2023. We included studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment (watchful waiting) in children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 trials that together enrolled 1,036 children aged about 3 to 11 years. All trials compared a self‑administered autoinflation device with watchful waiting. Children were usually asked to do the autoinflation two to three times a day for 2 to 12 weeks. The longest follow‑up reported was 11 weeks.\n\nHearing\nWe are very uncertain whether autoinflation helps children regain normal hearing.\n\nQuality of life\nAutoinflation may lead to a moderate improvement in ear‑related quality of life after short‑term follow‑up.\n\nEar pain\nThe evidence is very uncertain, but there may be an increased risk of ear pain.\n\nMiddle‑ear fluid\nAutoinflation may slightly reduce the chance that fluid remains in the middle ear – about nine fewer children per hundred still had fluid after three months.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, involved different groups of children, used varied delivery methods, and did not cover all the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we wanted to assess.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to January 2023.\n",
