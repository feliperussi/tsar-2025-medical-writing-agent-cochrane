The most serious problems are surgical site infections (SSIs) and anastomotic leaks. Both can lead to longer hospital stays, delayed recovery, and lasting health problems because the large bowel naturally contains many bacteria.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether a combined approach of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP – cleaning the bowel with a laxative) plus oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB – taking antibiotics by mouth) reduces postoperative complications compared with MBP alone, oAB alone, or no preparation at all.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registries and reference lists for randomised controlled trials up to December 2021. We included trials that compared MBP + oAB with one of the three alternatives in adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery and that used standard intravenous antibiotics around the time of surgery. We pooled the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials involving 5,264 participants. Compared with MBP alone, MBP + oAB probably reduces the risk of SSIs by about 44% and the risk of anastomotic leaks by about 40% (moderate‑certainty evidence). This means that for every 100 patients who receive the combined preparation, about 40‑45 fewer will develop an infection or a leak compared with cleaning alone. The combined preparation probably makes little or no difference to death rates, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay.\nEvidence is very uncertain when we compare the combined method with oAB alone or with no preparation, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about those comparisons.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the results, but some studies may have been unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), included diverse groups of patients, used different delivery methods, and were small in size. Only a few trials reported side‑effects of the bowel preparation.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to December 2021, so the evidence is current to that date.",
