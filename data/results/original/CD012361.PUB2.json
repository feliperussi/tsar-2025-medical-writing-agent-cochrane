  "text": "Dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation\n\nBackground\nDexmedetomidine is a selective alpha‐2 agonist with minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile. It is thought to be safer than morphine or stronger opioids, which are drugs currently used for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants. Dexmedetomidine is increasingly being used in children and infants despite not being licenced for analgesia in this group.\n\nObjectives\nTo determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared with other non‐opioids, opioids, or placebo.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registries in September 2023.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine compared with other non‐opioids, opioids, or placebo for sedation and analgesia in neonates (aged under four weeks) requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were level of sedation and level of analgesia. Our secondary outcomes included days on mechanical ventilation, number of infants requiring additional medication for sedation or analgesia (or both), hypotension, neonatal mortality, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\nMain results\nWe identified no eligible studies for inclusion.\nWe identified four ongoing studies, two of which appear to be eligible for inclusion; they will compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborn infants requiring surgery. We listed the other two studies as awaiting classification pending assessment of full reports. One study will compare dexmedetomidine with morphine in asphyxiated newborns undergoing hypothermia, and the other (mixed population, age up to three years) will evaluate dexmedetomidine versus ketamine plus dexmedetomidine for echocardiography. The planned sample size of the four studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Data from these studies may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine efficacy and safety.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nDespite the increasing use of dexmedetomidine, there is insufficient evidence supporting its routine use for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, data on dexmedetomidine safety are scarce, and there are no data available on its long‐term effects.\nFuture studies should address the efficacy, safety, and long‐term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants.",
