  "text": "Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome\n\nBackground\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives (COC), which provide both progestin and oestrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. A combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and a low oestrogen dose has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose combined oral contraceptives for contraception.\n\nObjectives\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COCs containing drospirenone in women with PMS.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trial register, CENTRAL (now containing output from two trials registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, Google Scholar, and Epistemonikos on 29 June 2022. We checked included studies' reference lists and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared COCs containing drospirenone with placebo or with another COC for treatment of women with PMS.\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were effects on premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes included effects on mood, adverse events, and response rate to study medications.\n\nMain results\nWe included five RCTs (858 women analysed, most diagnosed with PMDD). The evidence was very low to moderate quality; the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious inconsistency and imprecision.\nCOCs containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (EE) versus placebo\nCOCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve overall premenstrual symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.59 to ‐0.24; 2 RCTs, N = 514; I2= 64%; low‐quality evidence); and functional impairment due to premenstrual symptoms in terms of productivity (mean difference (MD) ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.08; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I2= 47%; low‐quality evidence), social activities (MD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.04; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I2= 53%; low‐quality evidence), and relationships (MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.06; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I2= 45%; low‐quality evidence). The effects from COCs containing drospirenone may be small to moderate.\nCOCs containing drospirenone and EE may increase withdrawal from trials due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 3.41, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.78; 4 RCT, N = 776; I2= 0%; low‐quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the risk of withdrawal due to adverse effects from placebo is 3%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 6% and 16%.\nWe are uncertain of the effect of drospirenone plus EE on premenstrual mood symptoms, when measured by validated tools that were not developed to assess premenstrual symptoms.\nCOCs containing drospirenone may lead to more adverse effects in total (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.11; 3 RCT, N = 739; I2= 0%; low‐quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the risk of having adverse effects from placebo is 28%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 40% and 54%. It probably leads to more breast pain, and may lead to more nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and menstrual disorder. Its effect on nervousness, headache, asthenia, and pain is uncertain. There was no report of any rare but serious adverse effects, such as venous thromboembolism in any of the included studies.\nCOCs containing drospirenone may improve response rate (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40; 1 RCT, N = 449; I2not applicable; low‐quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the response rate from placebo is 36%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 39% and 58%.\nWe did not identify any studies that compared COCs containing drospirenone with other COCs.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nCOCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve premenstrual symptoms that result in functional impairments in women with PMDD. The placebo also had a significant effect. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may lead to more adverse effects compared to placebo. We do not know whether it works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other combined oral contraceptives that contain a different progestogen.",
