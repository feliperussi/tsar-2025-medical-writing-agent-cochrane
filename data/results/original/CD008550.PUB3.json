  "text": "Pharmacological treatment of gastro‐oesophageal reflux in children\n\nBackground\nGastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) is characterised by the regurgitation of gastric contents into the oesophagus. GOR is a common presentation in infancy, both in primary and secondary care, affecting approximately 50% of infants under three months old. The natural history of GOR in infancy is generally of a self‐limiting condition that improves with age, but older children and children with co‐existing medical conditions can have more protracted symptoms. The distinction between gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and GOR is debated. Current National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines define GORD as GOR causing symptoms severe enough to merit treatment. This is an update of a review first published in 2014.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for GOR in infants and children.\n\nSearch methods\nFor this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science up to 17 September 2022. We also searched for ongoing trials in clinical trials registries, contacted experts in the field, and searched the reference lists of trials and reviews for any additional trials.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any currently‐available pharmacological treatment for GOR in children with placebo or another medication. We excluded studies assessing dietary management of GORD and studies of thickened feeds. We included studies in infants and children up to 16 years old.\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard methodology expected by Cochrane.\n\nMain results\nWe included 36 RCTs involving 2251 children and infants. We were able to extract summary data from 14 RCTs; the remaining trials had insufficient data for extraction. We were unable to pool results in a meta‐analysis due to methodological differences in the included studies (including heterogeneous outcomes, study populations, and study design).\nWe present the results in two groups by age: infants up to 12 months old, and children aged 12 months to 16 years old.\nInfants\nOmeprazole versus placebo: there is no clear effect on symptoms from omeprazole. One study (30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) showed cry/fuss time in infants aged three to 12 months had altered from 246 ± 105 minutes/day at baseline (mean +/‐ standard deviation (SD)) to 191 ± 120 minutes/day in the omeprazole group and from 287 ± 132 minutes/day to 201 ± 100 minutes/day in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 10 minutes/day lower (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐89.1 to 69.1)). The reflux index changed in the omeprazole group from 9.9 ± 5.8% in 24 hours to 1.0 ± 1.3% and in the placebo group from 7.2 ± 6.0% to 5.3 ± 4.9% in 24 hours (MD 7% lower, 95% CI ‐4.7 to ‐9.3).\nOmeprazole versus ranitidine: one study (76 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) showed omeprazole may or may not provide symptomatic benefit equivalent to ranitidine. Symptom scores in the omeprazole group changed from 51.9 ± 5.4 to 2.4 ± 1.2, and in the ranitidine group from 47 ± 5.6 to 2.5 ± 0.6 after two weeks: MD ‐4.97 (95% CI ‐7.33 to ‐2.61).\nEsomeprazole versus placebo: esomeprazole appeared to show no additional reduction in the number of GORD symptoms compared to placebo (1 study, 52 neonates; very low‐certainty evidence): both the esomeprazole group (184.7 ± 78.5 to 156.7 ± 75.1) and placebo group (183.1 ± 77.5 to 158.3 ± 75.9) improved: MD ‐3.2 (95% CI ‐4.6 to ‐1.8).\nChildren\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at different doses may provide little to no symptomatic and endoscopic benefit.\nRabeprazole given at different doses (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg) may provide similar symptom improvement (127 children in total; very low‐certainty evidence). In the lower‐dose group (0.5 mg/kg), symptom scores improved in both a low‐weight group of children (< 15 kg) (mean ‐10.6 ± SD 11.13) and a high‐weight group of children (> 15 kg) (mean ‐13.6 ± 13.1). In the higher‐dose groups (1 mg/kg), scores improved in the low‐weight (‐9 ± 11.2) and higher‐weight groups (‐8.3 ± 9.2). For the higher‐weight group, symptom score mean difference between the two different dosing regimens was 2.3 (95% CI ‐2 to 6.6), and for the lower‐weight group, symptom score MD was 4.6 (95% CI ‐2.9 to 12).\nPantoprazole: pantoprazole may or may not improve symptom scores at 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, and 1.2 mg/kg pantoprazole in children aged one to five years by week eight, with no difference between 0.3 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg dosing (0.3 mg/kg mean −2.4 ± 1.7; 1.2 mg/kg −1.7 ± 1.2: MD 0.7 (95% CI ‐0.4 to 1.8)) (one study, 60 children; very low‐certainty evidence).\nThere were insufficient summary data to assess other medications.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThere is very low‐certainty evidence about symptom improvements and changes in pH indices for infants. There are no summary data for endoscopic changes. Medications may or may not provide a benefit (based on very low‐certainty evidence) for infants whose symptoms remain bothersome, despite nonmedical interventions or parental reassurance. If a medication is required, there is no clear evidence based on summary data for omeprazole, esomeprazole (in neonates), H₂antagonists, and alginates for symptom improvements (very low‐certainty evidence). Further studies with longer follow‐up are needed.\nIn older children with GORD, in studies with summary data extracted, there is very low‐certainty evidence that PPIs (rabeprazole and pantoprazole) may or may not improve GORD outcomes. No robust data exist for other medications.\nFurther RCT evidence is required in all areas, including subgroups (preterm babies and children with neurodisabilities).",
