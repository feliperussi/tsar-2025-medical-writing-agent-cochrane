  "text": "Entecavir for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B\n\nRationale\nChronic hepatitis B is a major worldwide public health concern. Entecavir, one nucleos(t)ide analogue antiviral therapy option, is recommended as the first‐line drug for chronic hepatitis B in many clinical guidelines. However, none of the guideline recommendations are based on the findings of a systematic review with meta‐analysis, where entecavir versus no treatment or placebo are compared directly.\n\nObjectives\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of entecavir versus no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, who are either hepatitis B e‐antigen (HBeAg)‐positive or HBeAg‐negative.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, three other databases, online trial registries, and reference lists, and contacted authors. The latest search was on 19 July 2024.\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included randomised clinical trials comparing entecavir versus no treatment or placebo in children or adults, or both, with chronic hepatitis B, and irrespective of treatment history with other antiviral drugs and other viral co‐infections. We allowed co‐interventions when administered equally to all intervention groups.\n\nOutcomes\nThe outcomes reported in this abstract and in the summary of findings table are all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life, and proportion of people with serious adverse events at the longest follow‐up.\n\nRisk of bias\nWe used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias in the included trials.\n\nSynthesis methods\nWe used a random‐effects model to meta‐analyse outcome results, where possible, and presented the results as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Where there was considerable heterogeneity, we performed a narrative analysis. We used a fixed‐effect model for sensitivity analysis. We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence.\n\nIncluded studies\nWe included 22 randomised clinical trials (published from 2005 to 2022) with 2940 participants diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. All trials had a parallel‐group design. The experimental intervention was oral entecavir, with a follow‐up duration of 5 weeks to 228 weeks. The comparator in 12 trials was no treatment, and in 10 trials was placebo. Fourteen trials equally administered co‐interventions to the trial participants in the entecavir and no treatment and placebo groups. One trial included participants between 14 years and 55 years of age, one trial included only children, 19 trials included only adults, and one trial did not provide the age of participants.\n\nSynthesis of results\nTwenty trials contributed data to the quantitative analysis. Ten trials (1379 participants) reported all‐cause mortality with a mean follow‐up duration of 48.9 weeks (range 5 to 100 weeks). The result was not estimable because no deaths occurred in any of the entecavir and no treatment or placebo groups. None of the trials provided data on health‐related quality of life. We are very uncertain about the effect of entecavir versus no treatment or placebo on the proportion of people with serious adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.32; absolute risk difference 22 fewer per 1000 (from 44 fewer to 21 more); 15 trials, 1676 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The mean follow‐up duration was 58.4 weeks (range 5 weeks to 228 weeks). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for these outcomes to very low, mainly because the overall risk of bias in most trials was with some concerns or high, and serious imprecision (no events or few events).\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nGiven the issues of risk of bias and insufficient power of the included trials and the very low certainty of the available evidence, we could not determine the effect of entecavir versus no treatment or placebo on critical outcomes such as all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events. There is a lack of data on health‐related quality of life. Given the first‐line recommendation and wide usage of entecavir in people with chronic hepatitis B, further evidence on clinically important outcomes, analysed in this review, is needed.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.\n\nRegistration\nRegistration: Entecavir for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, CD015536 via DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD015536.",
