  "text": "Approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings\n\nBackground\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment which, in most cases, can be managed with the appropriate spectacle correction. In 2021, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global target of a 40‐percentage‐point increase in effective coverage of refractive error by 2030. To achieve this global target, equitable access to refractive and optical services within community and primary care settings needs to be strengthened. This review will inform the development of technical guidance to support improvements in the testing and correction of refractive error among World Health Organization (WHO) member states.\n\nObjectives\nTo determine the range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, and the methods employed for their evaluation.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health databases, grey literature, and annual reports and websites of relevant organizations involved in eye‐care delivery from January 2002 to November 2022 to identify approaches for refractive and optical service delivery.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included observational and interventional studies, reviews, and reports from relevant organizations related to delivering refractive services and optical services for preschool and school‐aged children and adults in community and primary care settings published between January 2002 and November 2022. We searched for studies and reports published within the last 20 years because vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error has only recently become a public health and eye health priority, therefore we did not expect to find much relevant literature until after 2002.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts, and extracted data. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We synthesized data, and presented results as tables, figures, and case studies. This project was led by the World Health Organization (WHO) Vision and Eye Care Programme.\n\nMain results\nWe identified 175 studies from searches of databases and grey literature, 146 records from company reports, and 81 records from website searches of relevant organizations that matched our inclusion criteria. Delivery approaches for refractive and optical services in community care included school‐based, pharmacy, and outreach models, whereas primary care approaches comprised vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door‐to‐door delivery. In community care, school‐based and outreach approaches were predominant, while in primary care, a vision‐centre approach was mainly used. In the WHO African region, the school‐based and outreach approaches were mainly reported while, in the Americas, the outreach approach was mostly used. Very few approaches for service delivery were reported in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. Prominent gaps exist in the evaluation of the approaches, and few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nWe comprehensively describe a range of approaches for delivery of refractive and optical services in community and primary care. Further evaluation of their effectiveness will better inform the application of these service‐delivery approaches. The study outcomes will help guide WHO member states in strengthening refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels.\n\nFunding\nThis scoping review was supported by the Vision and Eye care Programme, World Health Organization and ATscale Global Partnership.\n\nRegistration\nThe protocol of this scoping review was published in the Open Source Framework.",
