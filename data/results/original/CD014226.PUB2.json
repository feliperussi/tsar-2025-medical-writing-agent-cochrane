  "text": "Fenestrated endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms\n\nBackground\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are abnormal dilatations of the aorta that most commonly affect its infrarenal segment, but can become more difficult to repair when they are close to or next to the renal arteries. The optimum treatment for these complex AAAs is unknown. One option is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which involves using fenestrations or scallops in the graft to facilitate access to the visceral arteries.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the benefits and harms of complex stent‐graft fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) versus open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative (non‐operative) management for people with complex AAAs.\n\nSearch methods\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov without language, publication year or publication status restrictions (published, unpublished, in press or in progress) on 28 March 2023.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, comparing treatment of complex AAA with FEVAR versus open surgical repair or conservative management in adults undergoing primary repair of complex AAA.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened studies obtained from the search for potential inclusion in the review, in accordance with theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality (30 days and one year), aneurysm‐related mortality at one year and length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were renal dysfunction at one year, reintervention rate at one year, visceral vessel patency at 30 days and one year, participant‐reported health‐related quality of life at one year, adverse events at one year and aneurysm‐related mortality at 30 days.\n\nMain results\nWe found no studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nWe did not identify eligible RCTs or quasi‐RCTs that compared treatment of complex AAAs with FEVAR versus open surgical repair or conservative management. This is a difficult area in which to conduct research due to low incidence rates and aneurysm heterogeneity. Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high‐quality evidence in this area feasible.",
