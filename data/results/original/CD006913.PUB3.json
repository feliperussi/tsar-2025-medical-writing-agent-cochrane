  "text": "Psychological interventions for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease\n\nBackground\nPersons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of suffering from psychological problems. The association is assumed to be bi‐directional. Psychological treatment is expected to improve quality of life (QoL), psychological issues and, possibly, disease activity. Many trials have tested various psychotherapy approaches, often in combination with educational modules or relaxation techniques, with inconsistent results.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state and disease activity in persons of any age with IBD.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched Web of Science Core Collection, KCI‐Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, MEDLINE, Psyndex, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and LILACS from inception to May 2023. We also searched trial registries and major gastroenterological and selected other IBD‐related conferences from 2019 until 2023.\n\nSelection criteria\nRandomized controlled trials of psychological interventions in children or adults with IBD compared to no therapy, sham (i.e. simulated intervention), or other active treatment, with a minimum follow‐up time of two months, were eligible for inclusion, irrespective of publication status and language of publication. Interventions included psychotherapy and other non‐pharmacological interventions addressing cognitive or emotional processing, patient education, or relaxation techniques to improve individual health status.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo raters independently extracted data and assessed the study quality using the Risk of Bias 2 Tool. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes and relative risks (RR) for event data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), based on separate random‐effects models by age group, type of therapy and type of control. An SMD of 0.2 was considered a minimally relevant difference. SMD ≥ 0.4 was considered a moderate effect. Group analyses were planned to examine differential effects by type of IBD, disease activity, psychological comorbidity, therapy subtype, and treatment intensity. Statistical heterogeneity was determined by calculating the I2statistic. Publication bias was assessed by presenting a funnel plot and calculating the Eggers Test. GRADE Profiling was used to describe the certainty of the evidence for relevant results.\n\nMain results\nSixty‐eight studies were eligible. Of these, 48 had results reported in sufficient detail for inclusion in the meta‐analyses (6111 adults, 294 children and adolescents). Two trials were excluded from the meta‐analysis following sensitivity analysis and tests for asymmetry because of implausible results. Most studies used multimodular approaches. The risk of bias was moderate for most outcomes, and high for some. The most common problems in individual trials were the inability to blind participants and investigators and outcome measures susceptible to measurement bias. The main issues leading to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were heterogeneity of results, low precision and high or moderate risk of bias in the included trials. Publication bias could not be shown for any of the inspected analyses.In adults, psychotherapy was slightly more effective than care‐as‐usual (CAU) in improving short‐term QoL (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.34; I2= 13%; 20 trials, 1572 participants; moderate‐certainty), depression (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.16; I2= 0%; 16 trials, 1232 participants; moderate‐certainty), and anxiety (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.40 to ‐0.17; I2= 1%; 15 studies, 1135 participants; moderate‐certainty). The results for disease activity were not pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2= 72%).Interventions which used patient education may also have small positive short‐term effects on QoL (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.32; I2= 11%; 12 trials, 1058 participants; moderate‐certainty), depression (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.07; I2= 11%; 7 studies, 765 participants; moderate‐certainty) and anxiety (SMD ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.00; I2= 10%; 6 studies, 668 participants; moderate‐certainty). We did not find an effect of education on disease activity (SMD ‐0.09, 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.10; I2= 38%; 7 studies, 755 participants; low‐certainty).Pooled results on the effects of relaxation techniques showed small effects on QoL (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41; I2= 30%; 12 studies, 916 participants; moderate‐certainty), depression (SMD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.02; I2= 0%; 7 studies, 576 participants; moderate‐certainty), and anxiety (SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.09; I2= 13%; 8 studies, 627 participants; moderate‐certainty). Results for disease activity were not pooled due to high heterogeneity (I2= 72%).In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy increased quality of life (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.02; I2= 19%; 3 studies, 91 participants; moderate‐certainty). The results for anxiety were inconclusive (SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI 0.‐64 to 0.46; 2 trials, 51 patients, very low‐certainty). Pooled effects were not calculated for depressive symptoms. Disease activity was not assessed in any of the trials compared to CAU. In education, based on one study, there might be a positive effect of the intervention on quality of life (MD 7.1, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.02; 40 patients; low‐certainty evidence) but possibly not on depression (MD ‐6, 95% CI ‐12.01 to 0.01; 41 patients; very low‐certainty). Anxiety and disease activity were not assessed for this comparison. Regarding the effects of relaxation techniques on children and adolescents, all results were inconclusive (very low‐certainty).\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nPsychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.The interpretation of these results presents a challenge due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, particularly concerning the type and various components of the common multimodular interventions. This complexity underscores the need for further research and exploration in this area.",
