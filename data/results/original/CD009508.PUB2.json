  "text": "Comparisons of approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women\n\nBackground\nPelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female stress, urgency, and mixed urinary incontinence. Training varies in exercise type (pelvic floor muscles contracting with and without other muscles), dose, and delivery (e.g. amount and type of supervision).\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of alternative approaches (exercise type, dose, and delivery) to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in the management of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency, and mixed) in women.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 September 2023; which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization ICTRP), handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles.\n\nSelection criteria\nRandomised, quasi‐randomised, or cluster‐randomised trials in female stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence where one trial arm included PFMT and another was an alternative approach to PFMT type, dose, or intervention delivery. We excluded studies with participants with neurological conditions or pregnant or recently postpartum.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We extracted and cross‐checked data and resolved disagreements by discussion. Data processing was as described in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions(Version 6). Synthesis was completed in intervention subgroups.\n\nMain results\nThis is a review update. The analysis included 63 trials with 4920 women; the previous version included 21 trials with 1490 women. Samples sizes ranged from 11 to 362. Overall, study participants were mid‐age (45 to 65 years) parous women with stress or stress‐predominant mixed urinary incontinence (46 trials), who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction. Trials were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle‐ or high‐income settings (53 trials). All trials had one or more arms using 'direct' PFMT, defined as repeated, isolated, voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions.\nTrials were categorised as comparisons of exercise type (27 trials, 3 subgroups), dose (11 trials, 5 subgroups, 1 with no data), and delivery (25 trials, 5 subgroups). Incontinence quality of life data are reported here as the primary outcome. Adverse event data were summarised narratively.\nComparison 1: exercise type\nCo‐ordinated training (body movements with concurrent pelvic floor muscle contraction) versus direct PFMT\nCo‐ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.44 to −0.01; I2= 81%; 8 trials, 356 women; low‐certainty evidence).\nIndirect training (exercises that are not contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) versus direct PFMT\nDirect PFMT may moderately improve quality of life (SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.02; I2= 78%; 4 trials, 170 women; low‐certainty evidence).\nIndirect training combined with direct PFMT versus direct PFMT\nCombining indirect training with direct PFMT may make little to no difference in quality of life (SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.10; I2= 33; 7 trials, 482 women; low‐certainty evidence).\nComparison 2: exercise dose\nPFMT with resistance device versus PFMT without resistance device\nPFMT without a resistance device may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 0.22, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.48; I2= 32%; 3 trials, 227 women; very low‐certainty evidence).\nMaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions versus submaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions\nNo data reported.\nPFMT more days per week versus PFMT fewer days per week\nPFMT more days per week may greatly improve incontinence quality of life (SMD −1.60, 95% CI −2.15 to −1.05; 1 trial, 68 women; low‐certainty evidence).\nPFMT in upright body positions versus PFMT when lying down\nNo data reported.\nComparison 3: exercise intervention delivery\nPFMT supervised in clinic versus PFMT at home\nClinic supervision may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.65 to 0.05; I2= 89%; 3 trials, 137 women; very low‐certainty evidence).\nMore clinician contact for PFMT supervision versus less clinician contact\nNo usable data reported.\nIndividual supervision of PFMT versus group supervision\nIndividually supervised PFMT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life (SMD −0.18, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.01; I2= 0%; 5 trials, 544 women; moderate‐certainty evidence).\nPFMT supervised in clinic versus supervision using e‐health (mobile app communication with clinicians)\nClinic supervision may make little to no difference in incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD −0.11, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.19; 1 trial, 173 women; very low‐certainty evidence).\nPFMT instruction delivered via e‐health versus written instruction\nE‐health delivery may slightly improve quality of life (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.01; I2= 25%; 3 studies, 318 women; low‐certainty evidence).\nAdverse events\nNine trials collected adverse event data; 66/1083 (6%) women had an adverse event. Almost all events were associated with use of an intravaginal or intrarectal training device. The adverse events were vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort.\nLimitations in the evidence\nFour main factors influenced our certainty in the evidence: 44 trials were at unclear or high risk of selection bias; data were sparse in some subgroups with few trials, trials that did not measure outcomes of interest, or did not report usable data; results were inconsistent; and many trials were small (imprecise).\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nAlthough there is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that some approaches to PFMT are better than others, for some there was little or no difference. The 7th International Consultation on Incontinence recommends PFMT as first‐line therapy for women with urinary incontinence. Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions) may result in a small improvement in incontinence quality of life compared to indirect training. In terms of improved quality of life, PFMT can be supervised individually or in a group because it probably makes little to no difference in achieving this outcome.\nMany comparisons had low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence, often because there was only one trial or several small trials with methodological limitations.\nMore, better designed and reported trials, directly comparing PFMT approaches are needed, especially trials investigating exercise dose.",
