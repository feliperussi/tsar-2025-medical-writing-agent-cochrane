  "text": "Pharmacological, non‐invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions, and their combination, for treating depression after stroke\n\nBackground\nDepression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated.\n\nObjectives\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non‐invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke.\n\nSearch methods\nThis is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.\nWe searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke, and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022). We contacted study authors.\n\nSelection criteria\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: 1) pharmacological interventions with placebo; 2) non‐invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; 3) psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; 4) pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; 5) pharmacological intervention and non‐invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; 6) non‐invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; 7) pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; 8) pharmacological intervention and non‐invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non‐invasive brain stimulation; and 9) non‐invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non‐invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from included studies. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and certainty of the evidence according to GRADE.\n\nMain results\nWe included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants. Data were available for: 1) 20 comparisons; 2) nine comparisons; 3) 25 comparisons; 4) three comparisons; 5) 14 comparisons; and 6) one comparison. We found no trials for comparisons 7 to 9.\nComparison 1: Pharmacological interventionsVery low‐certainty evidence from eight trials suggests pharmacological interventions decreased the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; P = 0.002; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) at end of treatment and very low‐certainty evidence from six trials suggests that pharmacological interventions decreased the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; P = 0.0002; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo. More adverse events related to the central nervous system (CNS) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; P = 0.008; 5 RCTs; 488 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; P = 0.002; 4 RCTs; 473 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) were noted in the pharmacological intervention than in the placebo group.\nComparison 2: Non‐invasive brain stimulationVery low‐certainty evidence from two trials show that non‐invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.14; P = 0.14; 2 RCTs; 130 participants) and the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52, 1.37; P = 0.49; 2 RCTs; 130 participants) compared to sham stimulation. Non‐invasive brain stimulation resulted in no deaths.\nComparison 3: Psychological therapyVery low‐certainty evidence from six trials suggests that psychological therapy decreased the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; P = 0.01; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control. No trials of psychological therapy reported on the outcome inadequate response to treatment. No differences in the number of deaths or adverse events were found in the psychological therapy group compared to the usual care/attention control group.\nComparison 4: Pharmacological interventions with psychological therapyNo trials of this combination reported on the primary outcomes. Combination therapy resulted in no deaths.\nComparison 5: Pharmacological interventions with non‐invasive brain stimulationNon‐invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention reduced the number of people meeting study criteria for depression at end of treatment (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; P = 0.002; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but not the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; P = 0.75; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to pharmacological therapy alone. Very low‐certainty evidence from five trials suggest no difference in deaths between this combination therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.16; P = 0.93; 487 participants) compared to pharmacological therapy intervention and sham stimulation or usual care.\nComparison 6: Non‐invasive brain stimulation with psychological therapyNo trials of this combination reported on the primary outcomes.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nVery low‐certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression while non‐invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression. Pharmacological intervention was associated with adverse events related to the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments.",
