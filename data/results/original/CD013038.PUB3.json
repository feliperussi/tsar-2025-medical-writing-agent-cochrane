  "text": "Exposure to the smell and taste of milk to accelerate feeding in preterm infants\n\nBackground\nPreterm infants (born before 37 weeks' gestation) are often unable to co‐ordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing for oral feeding because of their immaturity. In such cases, initial nutrition is provided by orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. Feeding intolerance is common and can delay attainment of full enteral and sucking feeds, prolonging the need for nutritional support and the hospital stay. Smell and taste play an important role in the activation of physiological pre‐absorptive processes that contribute to food digestion and absorption. However, during tube feeding, milk bypasses the nasal and oral cavities, limiting exposure to the smell and taste of milk. Provision of the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds offers a non‐invasive and low‐cost intervention that, if effective in accelerating the transition to enteral feeds and subsequently to sucking feeds, would bring considerable advantages to infants, their families, and healthcare systems.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess whether exposure to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula administered with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.\n\nSearch methods\nWe conducted searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Epistemonikos to 26 April 2023. We also searched clinical trial databases and conference proceedings.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised and quasi‐randomised studies that evaluated exposure versus no exposure to the smell or taste of milk (or both) immediately before or at the time of tube feeds.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data according to Cochrane Neonatal methodology. We performed meta‐analyses using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.\n\nMain results\nWe included eight studies (1277 preterm infants). Seven studies (1244 infants) contributed data for meta‐analysis.\nThe evidence suggests that exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds has little to no effect on time taken to reach full sucking feeds (MD −1.07 days, 95% CI −2.63 to 0.50; 3 studies, 662 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported no adverse effects related to the intervention. The intervention may have little to no effect on duration of parenteral nutrition (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI −0.24 to 0.71; 3 studies, 977 infants; low‐certainty evidence), time to reach full enteral feeds (MD −0.16 days, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.12; 1 study, 736 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) or risk of necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.84; 2 studies, 435 infants; low‐certainty evidence), although the evidence for time to reach full enteral feeds is very uncertain. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds probably has little to no effect on risk of late infection (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.75; 2 studies, 436 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no data available to assess feeding intolerance.\nThe included studies had small sample sizes and methodological limitations, including unclear or lack of randomisation (four studies), lack of blinding of participants and personnel (five studies), unclear or lack of blinding of the outcome assessor (all eight studies), and different inclusion criteria and methods of administering the interventions.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe results of our meta‐analyses suggest that exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. We found no clear difference between exposure and no exposure to the smell or taste of milk on safety outcomes (adverse effects, necrotising enterocolitis, and late infection).\nResults from one ongoing study and two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review. Future research should examine the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on health outcomes during hospitalisation, such as attainment of feeding skills, safety, feed tolerance, infection, and growth. Future studies should be powered to detect the effect of the intervention in infants of different gestational ages and on each sex separately. It is also important to determine the optimal method, frequency, and duration of exposure.",
