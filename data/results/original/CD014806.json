  "text": "Sucrose analgesia for heel‐lance procedures in neonates\n\nBackground\nSucrose has been examined for calming and pain‐relieving effects in neonates for invasive procedures such as heel lance.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effectiveness of sucrose for relieving pain from heel lance in neonates in terms of immediate and long‐term outcomes\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched (February 2022): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and three trial registries.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials where term and/or preterm neonates received sucrose for heel lances. Comparison treatments included water/placebo/no intervention, non‐nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, breast milk, music, acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin‐to‐skin care.\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. We reported mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed‐effect model for continuous outcome measures. We assessed heterogeneity by the I2test. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.\n\nMain results\nWe included 55 trials (6273 infants): 29 included term neonates, 22 included preterm neonates, and four included both. Heel lance was investigated in 50 trials; 15 investigated other minor painful procedures in addition to lancing.\nSucrose vs control\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in PIPP scores compared to the control group at 30 seconds (MD ‐1.74 (95% CI ‐2.11 to ‐1.37); I2= 62%; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 60 seconds after lancing (MD ‐2.14, 95% CI ‐3.34 to ‐0.94; I2= 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence).\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effects of sucrose on DAN scores compared to water at 30 seconds after lancing (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐8.58 to 4.78; heterogeneity not applicable (N/A); very low‐certainty evidence).\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in NIPS scores compared to water immediately after lancing (MD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐2.42 to ‐1.58; heterogeneity N/A; moderate‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs NNS\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to NNS during the recovery period after lancing (MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 1.50; heterogeneity not applicable; very low‐certainty evidence) and on DAN scores at 30 seconds after lancing (MD ‐1.20, 95% CI ‐7.87 to 5.47; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose + NNS vs NNS\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose + NNS on PIPP scores compared to NNS during lancing (MD ‐4.90, 95% CI ‐5.73 to ‐4.07; heterogeneity not applicable; very low‐certainty evidence) and during recovery after lancing (MD ‐3.80, 95% CI ‐4.47 to ‐3.13; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effects of sucrose + NNS on NFCS scores compared to water + NNS during lancing (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.47 to 0.27; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs glucose\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to glucose at 30 seconds (MD 0.26, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 1.22; heterogeneity not applicable; low‐certainty evidence) and 60 seconds after lancing (MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.79 to 0.75; heterogeneity N/A; low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs breastfeeding\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to breastfeeding at 30 seconds after lancing (MD ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐0.49 to 1.88; I2= 94%; very low‐certainty evidence).\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on COMFORTneo scores compared to breastfeeding after lancing (MD ‐2.60, 95% CI ‐3.06 to ‐2.14; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs expressed breast milk\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose may result in little to no difference in PIPP‐R scores compared to expressed breast milk during (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.84; heterogeneity not applicable; low‐certainty evidence) and at 30 seconds after lancing (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.71; heterogeneity N/A; low‐certainty evidence).\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose probably may result in slightly increased PIPP‐R scores compared to expressed breast milk 60 seconds after lancing (MD 1.10, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.86; heterogeneity N/A; low‐certainty evidence).\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on DAN scores compared to expressed breast milk 30 seconds after lancing (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐8.47 to 4.87; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs laser acupuncture\nThere was no difference in PIPP‐R scores between sucrose and music groups; however, data were reported as medians and IQRs.\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on NIPS scores compared to laser acupuncture during lancing (MD ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.43 to ‐0.29; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs facilitated tucking\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on total BPSN scores compared to facilitated tucking during lancing (MD ‐2.27, 95% CI ‐4.66 to 0.12; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence) and during recovery after lancing (MD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐1.72 to 1.10; heterogeneity N/A; very low‐certainty evidence).\nSucrose vs skin‐to‐skin + water (repeated lancing)\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to skin‐to‐skin + water at 30 seconds after 1st (MD 0.13, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.96); 2nd (MD ‐0.56, 95% CI ‐1.57 to 0.45); or 3rd lancing (MD‐0.15, 95% CI ‐1.26 to 0.96); heterogeneity N/A, low‐certainty evidence for all comparisons.\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to skin‐to‐skin + water at 60 seconds after 1st (MD –0.61, 95% CI ‐1.55 to 0.33); 2nd (MD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.75); or 3rd lancing (MD‐0.40, 95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.68); heterogeneity N/A, low‐certainty evidence for all comparisons.\nMinor adverse events required no intervention.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nSucrose compared to control probably results in a reduction of PIPP scores 30 and 60 seconds after single heel lances (moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose compared to NNS, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS in reducing pain. Sucrose compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin‐to‐skin care shows little to no difference in pain scores. Sucrose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence.",
