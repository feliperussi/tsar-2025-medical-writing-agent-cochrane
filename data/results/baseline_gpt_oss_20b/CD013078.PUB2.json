  "text": "Title: Is exercise better than other treatments for knee tendon pain in athletes?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are very uncertain whether exercise reduces pain compared with doing nothing, and it may make little or no difference to function compared with doing nothing. Exercise may also make little or no difference to pain, function, treatment success, or return to sport when compared with steroid injections or surgery. No studies reported harmful effects.\n- Most of the studies were small and had some problems that could affect the results, so we cannot be a sure about any benefits.\n- More research is needed that includes a wider range of people, uses larger groups, looks at long‑term outcomes, and records any side effects.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and aims:\nWhat is knee tendon pain in athletes?\nPatellar tendinopathy, often called knee tendon pain, is a common problem for people who jump, run, or play sports that involve a lot of leg work. It causes pain at the front of the knee where the tendon attaches to the kneecap and can make it hard to train or compete.\nWhy do we need to know if exercise helps?\nExercise programs are often suggested to make the tendon stronger and reduce pain, but many other treatments such as steroid shots, surgery, stretching, or special ultrasound devices are also used. Knowing which approach works best can help athletes and clinicians choose the safest and most effective care.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to compare any type of exercise program with other treatments or with no treatment at all, looking at how they affect pain, ability to move, overall success of the treatment, and whether athletes get back to sport.\n\nHow is knee tendon pain treated?\n- Exercise programs (strengthening, rest, or a mix of both)\n- Steroid injections\n- Surgery\n- Stretching routines\n- Pulsed ultrasound and friction therapy\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared exercise with other options or with no treatment, summed up what they found, and judged how confident we could be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: Seven studies involving a total of about two hundred athletes were included. The participants were mostly young adults who had been dealing with knee tendon pain for several years. Most studies had some problems that could affect the results, such as small numbers of participants and limited follow‑up.\nMain results:\n- Exercise vs no treatment: We are very uncertain whether exercise reduces pain compared with doing nothing, and exercise may make little or no difference to function compared with doing nothing.\n- Exercise vs steroid injection: Exercise may make little or no difference to pain compared with a steroid injection, and it may also make little or no difference to function.\n- Exercise vs surgery: We are very uncertain whether exercise reduces pain compared with surgery, and we are very uncertain whether it improves function compared with surgery. Exercise may make little or no difference to overall treatment success compared with surgery, and it may make little or no difference to returning to sport.\n- Exercise vs stretching: No studies reported outcomes for this comparison.\n- Exercise vs pulsed ultrasound and friction: No studies reported outcomes for this comparison.\nAdverse events: No studies reported any harmful effects from the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
