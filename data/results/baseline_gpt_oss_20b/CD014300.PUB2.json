  "text": "Do group psychological and social programs (psychosocial interventions) help people in crisis areas feel better and cope?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not know if group programs make a difference to children’s mental‑well‑being or prosocial behaviour in crisis settings.\n- The evidence suggests that group programs may slightly improve adults’ mental‑well‑being, but we are not confident because the studies were few and had some problems.\n- More research is needed to find out whether these programs help people in crisis areas, and to see if they work for different ages and in different places.\n\nWhat is a humanitarian crisis?\nA humanitarian crisis occurs when large numbers of people are forced to leave their homes because of war, natural disaster, or other emergencies, and they often lack basic safety, shelter, food, and health services.\n\nWhy is mental health important in crisis settings?\nLiving through such upheaval can cause intense fear, sadness, and stress, which can affect how people think, feel, and act. Supporting mental health can help individuals cope, stay safe, and rebuild their lives.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to see whether group psychological and social programs improve mental health, well‑being, or daily functioning for people living in crisis‑affected areas.\n\nHow did we do it?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared group psychosocial programs with no program or usual care in people living in crisis areas, and we looked at the results and how reliable they were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 13 studies involving a total of 7,917 participants. Nine studies focused on children or adolescents, and four looked at adults. The programs were delivered mainly in groups, often by trained community members, and took place in countries such as Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia, Palestine, Nepal, and Tanzania. Sessions usually lasted several weeks, with an average length of about 18 weeks.\n\nFor children and adolescents, the evidence does not show a clear benefit for mental‑well‑being or prosocial behaviour. We do not know if group programs have an effect on these outcomes. For overall functioning, only one small study reported results, and we do not know if group programs improve functioning. For adults, the evidence suggests that group programs may slightly improve mental‑well‑being, but we are not confident because the evidence is limited and the studies had some problems.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nThe evidence comes from a small number of studies that were short and varied in how they were run. Some studies had problems that make it hard to be sure about the results. Because of these issues, we are not confident that the findings are reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
