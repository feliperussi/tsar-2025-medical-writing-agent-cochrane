The evidence is very uncertain and does not show clear benefits or harms.\n- The studies that looked at these medicines were small, used different ways to measure vertigo, and did not consistently report side effects.\n- More research that uses the same clear outcomes and reports side effects is needed before we can say whether these medicines are useful.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease?\nMénière’s disease is a condition that causes repeated episodes of dizziness (vertigo), hearing loss and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These episodes can be very disruptive to daily life. The cause of the disease is not known, and doctors use different medicines to try to reduce the attacks and the symptoms.\n\nWhy do we need to know if the medicines work?\nIf a medicine really helps, people could feel better and have fewer dizzy spells. If it does not help, people could waste time and money and might experience unwanted side effects. Knowing whether the medicines work helps doctors and patients make better choices.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared any of the listed medicines with a placebo or no treatment in adults who have Ménière’s disease. We looked at how the medicines affected vertigo, hearing, quality of life and any side effects.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: Ten studies involving a total of about 848 participants were included. The participants were adults diagnosed with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. The medicines studied were betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. No study examined antihistamines for this condition. Each study compared the medicine with a placebo or with no treatment. The length of follow‑up varied, and the settings were not always described.\n\nMain results:\n- Betahistine: The evidence suggests a possible small improvement in vertigo, but we have little confidence in this finding because the studies were few and used different ways to measure the outcome.\n- Diuretics: The evidence is very uncertain; the studies did not show a clear benefit or harm for vertigo, hearing or quality of life.\n- Antivirals: The evidence is very uncertain; there was no clear indication that antivirals reduced vertigo attacks or improved hearing.\n- Corticosteroids: The evidence is very uncertain; the studies did not provide a clear picture of benefit or risk.\n- Serious side effects were not reported in any of the studies, but the small size of the studies means we cannot be sure that rare harms would have been detected.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe confidence in the results is low because the studies were small, used different ways to measure vertigo, and did not all report side effects. The results were not consistent across studies, and the total number of participants was limited. Because of these issues, we cannot be sure whether any of the medicines truly help or harm people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe literature search was completed on 14 September 2022. No newer systematic review on this specific question was identified, so the evidence reflects what was available up to that date.",
