The brief interruption is thought to send protective signals that might help other organs cope with the stress of surgery. Major blood vessel surgery, also called vascular surgery, involves repairing or replacing large arteries or veins. These operations are needed when blood flow is blocked or weakened, but they carry risks such as heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, and even death.\n\nAims\nThe review set out to find out whether remote ischaemic preconditioning changes the chances of death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time needed for the operation in people having major blood vessel surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the technique with no technique in people undergoing major blood vessel surgery. We combined the results and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nFourteen studies involving a total of about 1,300 people were included. Participants were mostly older adults, with ages ranging from the mid‑sixties to the mid‑seventies, and most were men. The studies were carried out between 2003 and 2019 in various hospitals. In each study, some participants received the brief blood‑flow interruption before their operation, while others received the usual care without the technique.\n\nThe review looked at several outcomes. For death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, length of hospital stay, and the time spent in surgery, the combined evidence suggests that the technique probably makes little or no difference. For loss of a limb, the evidence was less certain because only a few studies reported this outcome, so we cannot say confidently whether the technique helps or harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings for most outcomes because the studies were small, used different ways of applying the technique, and some may not have been published. The variation between studies and the limited number of participants make the results less precise. For limb loss, the evidence is very uncertain because only a small number of participants were studied.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe literature search was completed in April 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
