  "text": "Title: Does cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild or moderate dementia manage everyday tasks?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in everyday functioning for people with mild or moderate dementia, and it also likely enhances satisfaction with daily activities; no harmful effects were reported.\n\n- We are moderately confident that the intervention may cause small improvements in some cognitive domains, while we have little confidence that it reduces anxiety or depression; evidence for these outcomes is uncertain.\n\n- More high‑quality research is needed to confirm lasting benefits and to explore effects on caregivers and quality of life.\n\nIntroduction:\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation?\nCognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that focuses on helping individuals use their remaining abilities to achieve personally meaningful goals in daily life. It involves strategies, practice, and support tailored to each person’s strengths and challenges.\nWhy is everyday functioning important?\nEveryday functioning encompasses the ability to perform routine tasks such as cooking, managing finances, and personal care. Maintaining independence in these areas is central to dignity, wellbeing, and reduced caregiver burden for people living with dementia.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nThe review aimed to determine whether cognitive rehabilitation improves everyday functioning and related outcomes for people with mild or moderate dementia, compared with usual care or alternative interventions.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for controlled studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care or other controls, combined their findings, and assessed confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics:\nWe identified several trials involving adults with mild or moderate dementia, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease. Participants were predominantly older adults living in community settings across various high‑income countries. Interventions varied in duration and content but all emphasized goal‑directed training and strategy use. Comparators included usual care, educational programs, or other therapeutic approaches.\n\nResults:\nPrimary outcomes:\nCognitive rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in everyday functioning, and it probably causes a large increase in satisfaction with daily activities. Confidence in these findings is high.\nSecondary outcomes:\nThe intervention may cause a small improvement in overall cognition, with moderate confidence. It may cause a small improvement in mood, but confidence is low. It may cause a small reduction in anxiety, with very low confidence. Effects on quality of life and caregiver burden remain uncertain, with low confidence.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe evidence suggests that a personalized, goal‑oriented rehabilitation program can substantially enhance the ability of people with mild or moderate dementia to manage daily tasks and feel more satisfied with their lives. While modest benefits are hinted at for broader cognitive and emotional outcomes, the certainty of these effects varies, reflecting differences in study design, sample size, and follow‑up length. No adverse effects were reported, supporting the safety of the condition.\n\nConclusion:\nCognitive rehabilitation appears to be an effective and safe approach for improving everyday functioning and satisfaction in people with mild or moderate dementia. Further rigorous studies are needed to clarify its impact on broader cognitive, emotional, and caregiver outcomes and to determine the durability of benefits over longer periods.",
