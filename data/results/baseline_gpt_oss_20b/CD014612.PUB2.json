  "text": "Does closing the holes in the intestine during weight‑loss surgery help prevent serious bowel problems?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Closing the holes probably reduces the chance of serious bowel problems that can block the intestine over many years, but we are not very confident about this.\n- Closing the holes probably makes little difference to the chance of complications after surgery, the chance of dying, or problems that happen during the operation.\n- We are not sure if closing the holes changes how long people stay in hospital, and more careful research is needed.\n\n**What is a serious bowel problem after weight‑loss surgery?**\nA serious bowel problem called an internal hernia can happen when a loop of the small intestine slips through a gap that can form in the tissue that holds the intestines in place. If the intestine gets stuck, it can block the flow of food and fluids, which can be life‑threatening.\n\n**What is a hole in the intestine and why might closing it help?**\nDuring the weight‑loss operation, surgeons can choose to close these gaps with stitches. The idea is that a closed gap will stop the intestine from slipping and forming an internal hernia. However, stitching the gap could also create a kink that might block the intestine.\n\n**Why is it important to know if closing the holes helps?**\nIf closing the gaps truly reduces serious bowel problems, surgeons might do it as a routine step. If it does not help or causes other issues, surgeons might avoid it. Knowing the real benefits and harms helps doctors and patients make better choices.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to see whether closing the gaps during weight‑loss surgery reduces serious bowel problems and whether it causes any other important benefits or harms.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for research that compared closing the gaps with not closing them, combined the results, and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found a few studies that together included many people who had weight‑loss surgery. All of the studies used a modern surgical approach and closed the gaps with strong stitches.\n\n- For serious bowel problems that can block the intestine over many years, the evidence suggests that closing the gaps probably leads to a big reduction in these problems, but we are not very confident about this.\n- For overall complications that happen shortly after surgery, the evidence suggests that closing the gaps probably makes little difference to the chance of these complications.\n- For the chance of dying shortly after surgery, the evidence is unclear; we do not know whether closing the gaps changes this risk.\n- For problems that happen during the operation, the evidence is also unclear; we do not know whether closing the gaps changes this risk.\n- For how long people stay in hospital, the evidence is unclear; we do not know whether closing the gaps makes the stay longer or shorter.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the research was few and because the studies had some problems that could affect the results. The uncertainty is especially large for the outcomes about death, problems during the operation, and hospital stay.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is current to the middle of this year.",
