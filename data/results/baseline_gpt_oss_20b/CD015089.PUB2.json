  "text": "Title: Are the HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) and HINTS Plus tests good at finding brain causes of sudden dizziness?\n\nKey messages:\n- The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations can help doctors spot brain causes of sudden dizziness, but the evidence is limited and we are not very confident about how accurate they are.\n- Video‑assisted versions of the tests may be helpful, yet the evidence is weak and we are unsure if they improve accuracy.\n- More high‑quality research is needed to confirm how well these tests work in different settings and with different clinicians.\n\nIntroduction:\nWhat is sudden dizziness and why is it a problem?\nSudden dizziness, also called acute vertigo, is a common reason people go to the emergency department. It can be caused by problems in the inner ear, the brain, or other systems, and missing a serious brain cause can lead to severe outcomes.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether the HINTS and HINTS Plus bedside examinations, performed with or without video assistance, are useful for identifying brain causes of sudden dizziness.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple medical databases for studies that evaluated the HINTS or HINTS Plus tests, combined the results, and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: Sixteen studies involving more than two thousand participants (average age about 60 years) were included. Most studies were conducted in emergency departments, and about half of the examinations were performed by neurologists or specially trained clinicians.\nMain results:\n- Clinical HINTS examinations probably correctly identify most people who have a brain cause of sudden dizziness.\n- Clinical HINTS examinations probably also correctly identify many people who do not have a brain cause.\n- Video‑assisted HINTS examinations have very limited evidence, so we are not sure whether they correctly identify people with a brain cause.\n- Clinical HINTS Plus examinations probably correctly identify most people with a brain cause and many people without a brain cause.\n- Video‑assisted HINTS Plus examinations have moderate evidence and probably correctly identify most people with a brain cause and many people without a brain cause.\n\nLimitations of the evidence:\nThe evidence is limited because many studies had small sample sizes, some had unclear methods, and most were carried out in emergency settings by clinicians with special training. This makes it difficult to know how well the tests would work in other settings or with clinicians who have less experience.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to September 2022.",
