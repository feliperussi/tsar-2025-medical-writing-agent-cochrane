Children with asthma can have episodes where symptoms get worse, sometimes needing urgent care.\n\nWhy is asthma education important?\nTeaching children and their families how to manage asthma—recognising triggers, using inhalers correctly, and knowing when to seek help—can help prevent severe episodes and improve daily wellbeing.\n\nWhat is home‑based education?\nHome‑based education means that the teaching takes place in the child’s own home, often through visits by a health professional, printed materials, or digital tools, rather than in a clinic or school setting.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether home‑based asthma education works better, the same, or worse than usual care (such as clinic visits) or a less intensive home program for children with asthma.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies that randomly gave children either a home‑based education program or another type of care. We included studies that measured emergency visits, hospital stays, need for oral steroids, quality of life, and days without symptoms. We checked the quality of each study and combined the results where possible.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified twenty‑six studies involving more than five thousand children. Most studies compared a home‑based program with usual care, while a few compared a more intensive home program with a less intensive one.\n\nMain results:\n- Emergency department visits: Children who received home‑based education experienced little to no difference in the number of emergency visits compared with those who received usual care or a less intensive home program.\n- Oral steroid use: Home‑based education also made little to no difference to the number of times children needed oral steroids for asthma attacks.\n- Hospital admission: When a more intensive home program was compared with a less intensive one, the intensive program may reduce the chance of being admitted to hospital, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Quality of life: Home‑based education may slightly improve children’s overall quality of life, yet the confidence in this finding is very low.\n- Symptom‑free days: There was little to no difference in the number of days children went without asthma symptoms between home‑based education and other approaches.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies varied in how they taught families, how long they followed the children, and how they measured outcomes. Many studies had small numbers of participants or incomplete reporting, which makes us less confident in the results. Because of these issues, the overall certainty of the evidence is low to very low, meaning the true effect could be different from what we observed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe search for studies was completed on 30 April 2024, so the findings reflect research published up to that date.",
