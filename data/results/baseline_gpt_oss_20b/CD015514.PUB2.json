  "text": "Title: Does face‑down positioning after eye surgery help keep the retina in place?\n\nKey Messages:\n– Face‑down positioning after eye surgery may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place, reduce certain eye folds and double vision, but it might raise eye pressure.\n– The evidence is very limited and we do not know if it changes how well people see or how they feel about their vision.\n– More carefully designed studies are needed to confirm these findings and to look at how patients feel about the different positions.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment?\nA macula‑involving retinal detachment is a serious eye problem where the light‑sensing part of the eye (the macula) pulls away from the rest of the retina. This can cause sudden loss of vision and is an emergency that needs surgery.\n\nWhy do doctors use face‑down positioning after eye surgery?\nAfter the eye is repaired with a gas bubble, doctors sometimes ask patients to lie on their stomachs for a few days. The idea is that the gas bubble pushes the retina back into place and keeps it from moving. Some doctors think this helps prevent problems like double vision or a distorted image.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether lying face‑down after eye surgery actually reduces the chance that the retina moves out of place and whether it affects vision, eye pressure, or how people feel about their sight.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared face‑down positioning with other positions after eye surgery. We combined the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics\nWe found three studies that included about 370 people who had eye surgery for a macula‑involving retinal detachment. Most of the people were men. Only one study reported race and ethnicity, and only one study said who paid for the research. The studies were done in several countries and most of them were judged to have low risk of bias.\n\nMain results (narrative statements)\n– Retinal displacement: Face‑down positioning may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place after surgery.\n– Vision (best‑corrected visual acuity): Face‑down positioning does not appear to change how well people see after surgery.\n– Distortion of the image: Face‑down positioning does not seem to change how distorted the image looks after surgery.\n– Quality of life: Face‑down positioning does not seem to change how people feel about their vision after surgery.\n– Outer retinal folds (a type of eye fold): Face‑down positioning may reduce the chance of these folds after surgery.\n– Double vision (binocular diplopia): Face‑down positioning may reduce the chance of double vision after surgery.\n– Eye pressure (intraocular pressure): Face‑down positioning may increase the chance of higher eye pressure after surgery.\n– Other eye problems: The studies did not find differences in other eye problems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because only three studies were found, and they were small and varied in how they were done. Some studies did not report all the information we wanted, and the results were not consistent across studies. Because of these issues, we cannot be sure that the findings are reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",
