The studies were small and had design problems, so we are not sure.\n- Surgery might improve the chance that the access stays open for about a month compared with mechanical removal, but we are uncertain.\n- More research is needed to find the safest and most effective way to treat a blocked dialysis access. Future studies should include many more people and should report any side effects.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is a blocked dialysis access?\nPeople who need long term dialysis usually have a special connection between a vein and an artery called a dialysis access. This connection can be a fistula, which is a natural link, or a graft, which is a small tube made of plastic. When the access becomes blocked, blood cannot flow properly and the person may need a temporary tube that can cause infections and other problems.\n\nWhy is it important to fix a blocked dialysis access?\nA functioning access is essential for dialysis to remove waste from the blood. If the access is blocked, treatment may be delayed, the risk of infection rises, and the person may need a hospital stay or a new surgical procedure. Keeping the access open improves quality of life and reduces the chance of serious complications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which of the available treatments works best to restore blood flow, keep the access open for as long as possible, and cause the fewest side effects.\n\nHow is a blocked dialysis access treated?\n- Mechanical removal, also called thrombectomy, where a device is used to pull the clot out.\n- Medication that dissolves the clot, known as thrombolysis.\n- Surgery to repair or replace the access, sometimes called a revision or a new fistula/graft.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared these treatments, combined the results, and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified fourteen studies that together included about twelve hundred participants. Most studies were small, lasted only a short time, and had design problems such as lack of proper randomisation or unclear reporting of side effects. The studies compared mechanical removal, clot‑dissolving medication, and surgical repair.\nThe main result was that no single treatment clearly outperformed the others in keeping the access open for a month or in preventing the access from failing later. Surgery might increase the chance that the access stays open for about a month compared with mechanical removal, but the evidence is uncertain. Information on side effects was rarely reported, so we cannot say which approach is safest.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the overall evidence because the studies were small, often had design flaws, and many were funded by companies that make the devices. Because of these problems, the results could change if larger, well designed studies are done.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",
