  "text": "Title: Does a special diet improve recovery after pancreatic cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- A special diet may help people feel better after surgery, but the evidence is not strong.\n- The studies we looked at were small and varied, so we cannot be sure of the exact benefit.\n- More high‑quality research is needed to know for sure.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims:\nWhat is the review about?\nThis review looked at whether giving people a special diet after surgery for pancreatic cancer changes how well they recover. The diet could include extra protein, specific nutrients, or a particular way of eating.\nWhy did we do it?\nWe wanted to find out if a special diet could reduce complications, help people stay alive longer, or improve quality of life after a major operation. Knowing this can help doctors and patients decide what to eat after surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for studies that compared a special diet with normal eating after pancreatic cancer surgery. We included studies that reported outcomes such as complications, survival, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: We found seventeen studies that together included about a thousand participants. The studies were done in many countries and used different types of special diets, such as high‑protein drinks, nutrient‑rich formulas, or specific food plans. The participants were adults who had surgery to remove part of the pancreas because of cancer.\n\nMain results: The evidence suggests that a special diet may lead to a small reduction in the number of people who have serious complications after surgery. Some studies also reported that people who ate the special diet felt a little better in terms of energy and overall well‑being. However, the differences were modest and not consistent across all studies. There was no clear evidence that a special diet changed how long people lived after surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany of the studies were small and did not always explain how they chose participants or measured outcomes, which makes it harder to trust the results. The studies used different kinds of diets and followed patients for different lengths of time, so the findings were not always comparable. Because of these problems, we have little confidence that the observed benefits are reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
