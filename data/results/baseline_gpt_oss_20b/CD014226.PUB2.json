The bulge is close to or touches the arteries that go to the kidneys and other abdominal organs. When the bulge is near these arteries, it is harder to fix.\n\nWhy do we need to compare treatments?\nPeople with a complex aneurysm can have different options. One option is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). This uses a graft that has small holes or cut‑outs (fenestrations) so that the graft can reach the arteries that go to the organs. Another option is open surgical repair (OSR), where the surgeon opens the abdomen and replaces the bulged section of the artery. A third option is conservative management, meaning no surgery is done and the aneurysm is monitored.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than OSR or conservative management for people with complex aneurysms. We looked at outcomes such as death, kidney problems, the need for another procedure, whether the arteries stayed open, and how people felt after one year.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with OSR or no surgery in adults who were having their first repair of a complex aneurysm. We included randomised trials and quasi‑randomised trials. We then summarised any results we found and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no studies that met our criteria. That means there is no published evidence that compares FEVAR with OSR or conservative management for complex aneurysms. The lack of studies is likely because complex aneurysms are uncommon and they look different from one person to another, making it hard to run large studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are no studies to base conclusions on. The condition is rare and varies a lot, which makes it difficult to conduct research. Without studies, we cannot say which treatment is better or safer.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n",
