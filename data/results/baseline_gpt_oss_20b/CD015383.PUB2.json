  "text": "Can psychedelic‑assisted therapy help people with serious illnesses feel less anxious, less depressed, and more at peace?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Psychedelic‑assisted therapy may lower anxiety and depression, but the evidence is not strong and could change with more research.\n- The therapy was generally safe; no serious side effects were reported, and most mild side effects went away within a week.\n- Because the studies were small and it was hard to keep participants from knowing which medicine they received, we are not confident that the results are reliable.\n\n**What is psychedelic‑assisted therapy?**\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy is a treatment that uses a special medicine that changes how the brain works, while a therapist is present to guide the experience. The medicine is taken in a safe, supervised setting, and the person has preparation and follow‑up sessions to talk about thoughts and feelings.\n\n**Why might this matter for people with serious illnesses?**\nPeople who have life‑threatening diseases often feel a lot of worry, sadness, and uncertainty. These feelings can make the illness feel even harder to live with. If a treatment can ease these feelings, it might improve how people cope with their illness.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy can reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness for people with serious illnesses, and whether the therapy causes any harmful side effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for carefully done studies that compared people who received psychedelic‑assisted therapy with people who received a placebo or another medicine, and we summarised what those studies showed.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found six studies that together included about 150 adults aged roughly 36 to 64 years. The studies were carried out in outpatient clinics in the United States and Switzerland and followed participants for up to a year. Funding came from groups that support psychedelic research, not from drug companies.\n\n*Anxiety* – In studies that used classic psychedelics such as psilocybin or LSD, people who received the therapy felt a large drop in anxiety compared with those who received a low‑dose or a placebo. Because the evidence is of low certainty, we say the therapy **may cause a large reduction in anxiety**. In the single study that used the drug MDMA (also known as Ecstasy), the evidence is very uncertain, so **it is unclear whether the therapy changes anxiety**.\n\n*Depression* – In the classic‑psychedelic studies, participants reported a moderate drop in depression compared with control groups. The evidence is of low certainty, so we say the therapy **may cause a moderate reduction in depression**. In the MDMA study, the evidence is very uncertain, so **it is unclear whether the therapy changes depression**.\n\n*Feelings about life (existential distress)* – One classic‑psychedelic study measured demoralisation, a sign of existential distress, and found a small improvement. The evidence is very uncertain, so **it is unclear whether the therapy helps with existential distress**.\n\n*Quality of life* – A few studies looked at overall quality of life and found mixed results. The evidence is very uncertain, so **it is unclear whether the therapy improves quality of life**.\n\n*Spiritual feelings* – Some studies measured changes in spiritual outlook and reported small changes, but the evidence is very uncertain, so **it is unclear whether the therapy affects spirituality**.\n\n*Side effects* – No serious side effects were reported in any study. Minor side effects such as nausea, temporary anxiety, and mild headaches were common, but they usually resolved within a week.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe studies were small, with only a few dozen people in each. It was difficult to keep participants from knowing which medicine they received, which can influence how they feel. The participants were mostly from two countries and may not represent all people with serious illnesses. Because of these issues, we cannot be very confident that the results will hold true for everyone.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",
