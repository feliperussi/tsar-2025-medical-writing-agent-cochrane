The evidence is very uncertain.\n- The studies we looked at were small and had problems that make us unsure about the results, so we cannot say which product is best.\n- More high‑quality studies are needed to give clear answers about how to keep arterial catheters safe and working.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims\nWhat are arterial catheters and why are they used?\nArterial catheters (ACs) are thin tubes that doctors put into a blood vessel to check blood pressure, take blood samples, or give medicines. They are common in operating rooms and intensive care units, but they can sometimes stop working or cause infections.\n\nWhy do we need to know if dressings help?\nIf a dressing or a device that holds the catheter in place works well, it could reduce the chance that the catheter stops working or that a patient gets an infection. Knowing which products work best would help doctors keep patients safe.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to see whether different dressings and securement devices keep arterial catheters working and prevent infections or other problems in people in hospitals.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared different dressings or devices for arterial catheters, summarised the results, and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found five studies that included 1,228 people and 1,228 arterial catheters. All of the studies had problems that make us unsure about the results. The studies were small, and the events we were looking for—such as catheter failure or infection—were rare.\n\nThe main findings are:\n- We are very uncertain whether adding a tissue adhesive to a standard dressing reduces the chance that the catheter stops working or causes infection.\n- We are very uncertain whether a different type of dressing (bordered polyurethane) changes the risk of catheter failure, infection, or the catheter becoming dislodged.\n- We are very uncertain whether a sutureless securement device added to a standard dressing changes the risk of catheter failure, infection, or the catheter becoming dislodged.\n- We are very uncertain whether an integrated securement dressing changes the risk of catheter failure, infection, or the catheter becoming dislodged.\n\nIn short, none of the products we looked at showed a clear advantage over the standard dressing. Because the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot say which product is best.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and the events we were looking for were very rare. The studies also had problems that make us unsure about the results, such as unclear methods and missing data. These issues mean that the findings could be wrong or incomplete.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",
