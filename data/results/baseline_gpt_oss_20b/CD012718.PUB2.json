It can cause pain, make eating difficult, and affect how people feel and act. If it is not treated, it can lead to loss of teeth and poorer overall health.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride (SDF)?\nSDF is a liquid that contains silver and fluoride. The silver part kills bacteria that cause decay, and the fluoride part helps strengthen the tooth surface. It is applied directly to the tooth and can stop decay without drilling.\n\nWhy do we need to compare SDF with other treatments?\nThere are many ways to prevent or treat decay, such as fluoride varnish, sealants, fillings, or minimally invasive techniques. We need to know whether SDF works better, the same, or worse than these options, especially for people who cannot tolerate more invasive care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to learn how SDF compares with other treatments or with no treatment for preventing new decay, stopping existing decay, and for side effects such as staining, pain, or other harms.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared SDF with other treatments or with no treatment, summarised the results, and judged how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 studies that together included more than 13,000 participants, most of whom were children. The studies varied in length, from a few months to several years, and were conducted in many countries. Funding came from a mix of public, private, and charitable sources.\n\nMain findings\n- When compared with no treatment or a placebo, SDF probably reduces new decay on root surfaces (moderate confidence). The evidence suggests a noticeable benefit, but we cannot be certain about the exact size of the effect.\n- SDF may help stop existing decay in primary (baby) teeth (low confidence). The studies were small and had some design problems, so we are less sure about this benefit.\n- For preventing new decay in primary teeth, in permanent teeth, or for stopping decay in permanent teeth, the evidence is very uncertain. We do not know whether SDF makes a difference for these outcomes.\n- When compared with fluoride varnish, the evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say if SDF is better, worse, or the same for preventing new decay.\n- Comparisons with sealants, resin infiltration, or the atraumatic restorative technique also have very low confidence. The available studies were few and had many limitations, so we cannot draw reliable conclusions.\n- Information about side effects such as tooth staining, pain, or other harms was poorly reported. The certainty about these outcomes is very low, meaning we do not know whether SDF causes noticeable staining or other problems.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nAll of the studies had a high risk of bias because participants were not always randomly placed into treatment groups, and the people delivering the treatment often knew which group they were in. This makes it hard to tell whether differences are due to the treatment or to other factors. Many studies were small, which adds uncertainty to the results. Some outcomes were measured in only a few studies, so the overall picture is incomplete.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe literature search was completed in June 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n",
