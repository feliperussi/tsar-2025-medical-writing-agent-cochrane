Some people do not get enough relief from medicines, so doctors sometimes use brain‑stimulation treatments. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used for many years and works by sending a brief electric current through the brain to create a controlled seizure. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer approach that uses magnetic fields instead of electricity to start the seizure. The idea is that MST might have similar benefits to ECT but cause fewer side‑effects, especially problems with memory.\n\nHow was the evidence gathered?\nWe looked for studies that directly compared MST with ECT in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. We searched medical databases for any trials that randomly assigned participants to receive either MST or ECT and that reported outcomes such as overall improvement, thinking... \n\nWhat did the evidence say?\nThe single study found that both MST and ECT led to some improvement in overall condition, but there was no clear evidence that one was better than the other. When looking at thinking abilities, the MST group appeared to show a modest improvement compared with the ECT group, but the result was uncertain because the study was small and had some methodological problems. Regarding memory, participants who received MST seemed to have fewer memory complaints than those who received ECT, yet again the evidence was not strong enough to be confident about this finding. The researchers also noted that the study had limitations such as a small number of participants, short follow‑up time, and some gaps in how the treatments were delivered, which means the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nWhat does it mean for people?\nAt this time, we do not have enough reliable information to say that MST is clearly better or worse than ECT for people with schizophrenia. The limited evidence hints that MST might cause fewer memory problems and could help thinking skills a bit more, but the uncertainty is high. For patients and clinicians, this means that the choice between MST and ECT should be based on individual circumstances, availability of the treatments, and personal preferences, while acknowledging that the scientific proof is still weak. More large, well‑designed studies are needed to determine whether MST offers real advantages over ECT in terms of effectiveness and side‑effects.",
