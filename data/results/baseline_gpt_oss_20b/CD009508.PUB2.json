  "text": "Plain Language Summary Title: What are the benefits and harms of pelvic floor muscle training for stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey Messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) probably improves quality of life a little compared with doing nothing or a fake treatment.\n- Some types of PFMT, such as using vaginal cones, may make quality of life worse, while other approaches like biofeedback do not seem to change quality of life.\n- More high‑quality research is needed to find out which PFMT method works best and to understand long‑term benefits and harms.\n\nIntroduction to the review topic and review aims:\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence?\nStress urinary incontinence is when a woman leaks urine during activities that put pressure on the bladder, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising.\n\nWhy might pelvic floor muscle training help?\nThe pelvic floor muscles support the bladder and urethra. Strengthening these muscles may help keep the bladder closed during pressure‑raising activities.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases for studies up to September 2023 that compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training with each other, with no treatment, or with other active treatments. We then combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: We found 63 trials that included a total of 4,920 women. Trial sizes ranged from 11 to 362 participants. The women were typically in their mid‑forties to mid‑sixties, had experienced stress‑predominant urinary leakage, and had not had prior surgery for this problem. Most trials were conducted in middle‑ or high‑income countries, and every trial had at least one group that used direct pelvic floor muscle training.\n\nMain results:\n- Coordinated training may slightly improve quality of life (low certainty).\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training may moderately improve quality of life compared with indirect training (low certainty).\n- Biofeedback makes little to no difference in quality of life compared with direct training (low certainty).\n- Vaginal cones may cause a large reduction in quality of life (low certainty).\n- Vaginal cones may slightly reduce quality of life compared with indirect training (low certainty).\n- Vaginal cones may slightly reduce quality of life compared with coordinated training (low certainty).\n- Vaginal cones make little to no difference in quality of life compared with biofeedback (low certainty).\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training probably improves quality of life a little compared with no treatment (moderate certainty).\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training probably improves quality of life a little compared with a sham (fake) training (moderate certainty).\n- It is unclear if direct pelvic floor muscle training makes a small difference compared with other active treatments (very low certainty).\n\nHarms: Some women reported vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort during the training, but serious side effects were not common.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials had unclear or high risk of selection bias, because there were few trials or missing data in some comparisons, because the results varied across studies, and because many studies were small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat should happen next?\nMore well‑designed, larger trials are needed to confirm which type of pelvic floor muscle training works best, to explore long‑term outcomes, and to better understand any potential harms.",
