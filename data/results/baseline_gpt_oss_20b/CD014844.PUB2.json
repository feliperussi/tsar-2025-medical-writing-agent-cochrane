  "text": "Do routine antibiotics help prevent infection after a miscarriage procedure?\n\nKey messages\n– Routine antibiotics may lower the chance of infection after a miscarriage procedure, but the evidence is uncertain and may not be strong.\n– The studies also show that antibiotics probably do not increase vomiting or diarrhea, and the risk of allergy is unclear.\n– More high‑quality studies are needed to confirm whether giving antibiotics routinely is useful and safe.\n\nWhat is early pregnancy loss and why is it a problem?\nEarly pregnancy loss, also called miscarriage, happens when a pregnancy ends before the baby can survive outside the womb. It can be very upsetting for people and can sometimes lead to infection if any pregnancy tissue remains in the uterus.\n\nWhy do doctors sometimes use antibiotics after a miscarriage procedure?\nWhen a miscarriage is managed with a surgical procedure that removes any remaining tissue, doctors sometimes give antibiotics to stop infection. The idea is that a small dose of medicine might keep the uterus clean and prevent sickness. However, it is not clear if giving antibiotics to everyone who has the procedure is necessary.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving antibiotics routinely to people who have a surgical miscarriage procedure actually reduces the chance of infection and whether it causes any side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched many medical databases for studies that compared giving antibiotics with giving a placebo or no medicine. We looked at the results of those studies and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included six studies that together involved 4,371 people who had a miscarriage procedure. The studies were carried out in many countries and covered all ages.\n\nEffect on infection\nThe overall evidence suggests that routine antibiotics may make little or no difference to the chance of infection. The evidence is uncertain because the studies had some problems. However, when we looked only at the three studies that were judged to be the most reliable, the evidence was stronger. Those studies suggest that antibiotics probably reduce the chance of infection.\n\nSide effects\nOnly one study looked at side effects. It found that antibiotics probably do not increase vomiting or diarrhea. The evidence about allergy is unclear because the study had very few cases.\n\nOther outcomes\nThe evidence about whether antibiotics reduce the need for more antibiotics later or shorten hospital stays is very uncertain. The studies were too small and had mixed results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies did not follow up well and many people did not take the antibiotics as planned. Some studies also had problems with how they were carried out, which makes it harder to be sure about the results. Only one study looked at side effects, so we do not know how common problems like vomiting, diarrhea or allergy really are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",
