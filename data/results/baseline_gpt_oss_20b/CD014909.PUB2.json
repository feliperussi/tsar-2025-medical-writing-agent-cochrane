Colorectal surgery, which is surgery on the colon or rectum, can lead to complications such as infections at the cut, leaks where the bowel is stitched, and slow recovery of the bowel after the operation. Doctors often clean the bowel before surgery by washing it out (mechanical bowel preparation) and sometimes give medicine by mouth (oral antibiotics) to try to lower these risks.\nWhat do we want to find out? We wanted to know whether using both the wash and the oral medicine together works better than using the wash alone, the oral medicine alone, or no preparation at all in preventing these complications.\n\nWhat did we do? We searched medical databases for studies that compared different ways of preparing the bowel before planned colorectal surgery, looked at the results, and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nStudy characteristics: We found 21 studies that together included 5,264 people who had planned colorectal surgery. Most studies involved adults and used a variety of wash solutions and oral medicines. All studies also gave a dose of medicine through a vein before the operation. Only four studies reported any side effects, and none mentioned dehydration, electrolyte problems, or kidney issues.\nMain results:\n- Compared with washing alone, the combined wash and oral medicine probably lowers the chance of infections at the surgery site and lowers the chance of leaks where the bowel is stitched together. The evidence for these benefits is fairly strong because the studies were generally well done, although some did not fully describe how they assigned people to groups.\n- The combined preparation does not seem to change the chance of death, problems with the bowel not moving after surgery, or how long people stay in the hospital. The evidence for these outcomes is less certain because the studies were smaller and sometimes had missing information.\n- When compared with oral medicine alone, the combined approach showed no clear difference in any of the outcomes. The confidence in this finding is limited because only a few studies made this direct comparison.\n- When compared with no preparation at all, the evidence is very uncertain. The studies were few and had many limitations, so we cannot say whether the combined preparation helps or not.\nSide effects: No study reported dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or kidney problems, but only a small number looked for these issues, so we cannot be sure that the combined preparation is free of such harms.\n\nLimitations: We are fairly confident about the reduction in infections and leaks when the wash and oral medicine are used together, but this confidence is reduced by some studies that did not clearly explain how they chose who got which treatment. For outcomes like death, bowel movement problems after surgery, and hospital stay, we have limited confidence because the studies were small, sometimes stopped early, or did not report all needed details. For the comparison with no preparation, we have very little confidence because only a few studies looked at this and they had many gaps in reporting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence? The literature search was completed on 15 December 2021, and no newer systematic review on this specific question has been published since then. Therefore, the evidence reflects the state of knowledge up to that date.\n",
