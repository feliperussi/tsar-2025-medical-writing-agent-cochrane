It is common in older adults because of eye diseases that get worse with age. When sight is reduced, people can find it harder to do everyday tasks, feel less confident, and may feel sad or anxious. Because of this, doctors and researchers look for ways to help people manage their condition and stay active.\n\nWhat are self‑management programs?\nSelf‑management programs teach people how to take care of their own eye health and daily life. They can include learning new skills, using special tools, getting support from friends or family, and setting personal goals. The idea is that if people feel more in control, they might feel better overall.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these self‑management programs actually help adults with vision loss feel better about their quality of life compared with people who receive usual care or no program at all.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies that compared self‑management programs with usual care or no program. We then combined the results of those studies and judged how confident we were in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 20 studies that together involved 3151 adults with vision loss. The studies were carried out in many countries and in different types of health settings. Most participants were older adults, and the main eye problem was a common age‑related disease.\n\nThe main results\n- For overall quality of life, the evidence suggests that self‑management programs may not make a noticeable difference compared with usual care or no program.\n- For vision‑related quality of life, the evidence also suggests little or no difference.\n- The programs do not appear to increase the risk of side effects or other problems.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were small, used different ways of measuring quality of life, and had varied program details. These factors make it hard to know whether the programs truly have an effect.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",
