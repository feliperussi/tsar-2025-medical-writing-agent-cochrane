    "output": "Which dose, duration, or form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (A type of treatment that uses special products to give small, steady doses of nicotine to help stop cravings and relieve symptoms that occur when a person is trying to quit smoking. These products include nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine lozenges, and nicotine patch, and some are available without a prescription. They do not contain any of the other chemicals found in tobacco products.) helps people quit smoking best?\n\nKey messages  \n- Using a combination NRT (using two different nicotine products together, such as a patch plus gum, lozenge or spray) increases the chance of quitting compared with using a single‑form NRT (using only one product). The evidence is fairly strong.  \n- Higher‑dose nicotine patches and higher‑dose nicotine gum probably give a small extra benefit over lower doses. Starting NRT before the quit day (preloading – using NRT while still smoking, then stopping on the quit day) probably helps more people quit, but the evidence is less certain.  \n- We still need more high‑quality research to decide the best dose, duration and timing of NRT, to compare fast‑acting NRT products (gum, lozenge, spray, inhaler or nasal spray) and to collect reliable information on side‑effects such as cardiac adverse events (heart‑related side‑effects, such as heart attacks or irregular heartbeats) and withdrawals due to treatment (stopping the study medication because of side‑effects).\n\nWhat health problem does nicotine replacement therapy try to solve?  \nSmoking cigarettes causes preventable disease and death worldwide. When people try to quit, they experience strong cravings and withdrawal (physical and mental symptoms that occur when a person suddenly stops or cuts back the use of an addictive substance). NRT provides nicotine in a different form to ease cravings and help people stay smoke‑free.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare different ways of giving NRT. Specifically we asked: which combinations of fast‑acting NRT (gum, lozenge, spray, inhaler or nasal spray) and patches work best? Are higher doses of patches or gum more effective? Does preloading improve success? Does the length of treatment matter? We also examined whether any approach, dose or schedule increased cardiac adverse events, serious adverse events (life‑threatening side‑effects that need hospital care) or withdrawals due to treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group register for randomised trials that compared different forms, doses, durations or schedules of NRT in people motivated to quit. We extracted smoking abstinence outcomes measured at six months or longer and pooled the results. We assessed confidence in each finding using the GRADE system (high‑certainty evidence = very reliable; moderate‑certainty evidence = reasonably reliable; low‑certainty evidence = not very reliable; very low‑certainty evidence = highly unreliable).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nThe review included 68 completed randomised trials with 43,327 adults who wanted to quit smoking. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics. All studies measured whether people were still not smoking at least six months after starting treatment. About half of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias, but removing those did not change the overall results.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n- Combination therapy (fast‑acting NRT plus a patch) increases quit rates. High‑certainty evidence shows that for every 100 smokers using a single‑form NRT, about 27 more will quit when they use the combination.  \n- Higher‑dose nicotine patches probably increase quit rates. Moderate‑certainty evidence suggests that using a 42/44 mg patch rather than a 21/22 mg patch, or a 21 mg patch rather than a 14 mg patch, may give roughly 10–15 extra quitters per 100 people.  \n- Starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) probably helps more people quit. About 25 more people per 100 may succeed when they begin NRT while still smoking, compared with starting on the quit day.  \n- Using a fast‑acting form alone (gum, lozenge, spray, inhaler or nasal spray) makes little or no difference to quit rates compared with using a patch alone. High‑certainty evidence shows similar success rates.  \n- Low‑certainty evidence indicates that the length of time patches or combination therapy are used does not clearly affect quit rates, and very low‑certainty evidence exists about which fast‑acting product is best.  \n- Safety outcomes (cardiac adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawals due to treatment) were reported only sporadically, giving low to very low‑certainty evidence. We cannot tell whether different NRT forms or doses change the risk of these adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings because participants often knew which treatment they received, many studies were small, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies up to April 2022."
