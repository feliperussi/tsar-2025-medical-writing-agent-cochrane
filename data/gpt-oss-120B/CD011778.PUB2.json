    "output": "Does adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to regular deep cleaning improve gum disease and dental‑implant disease?\n\nKey messages  \n- Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) (a treatment that uses a special drug that becomes active when exposed to light and kills bacteria) to the usual deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation – cleaning below the gum line) produces a small but statistically significant improvement in pocket depth and attachment level for periodontitis, with only mild, short‑lasting discomfort reported.  \n- For peri‑implant disease (infection around dental implants) the evidence is limited but suggests a modest reduction in the depth of the pocket around the implant; more robust studies are needed to confirm this benefit.  \n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for at least six months are needed to determine the long‑term benefit and safety of aPDT, especially for people with dental implants.  \n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and why do they matter?  \nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the gums and the bone that holds teeth. If it is not treated, the infection slowly destroys this supporting tissue, leading to loose teeth and possible tooth loss. Peri‑implant diseases are similar problems that occur around dental implants (artificial tooth roots). Inflammation around an implant (peri‑implant mucositis) can progress to loss of the supporting bone (peri‑implantitis), making the implant unstable or causing it to fail. Both conditions can make eating, speaking and smiling difficult and can lower a person’s quality of life.  \n\nHow are these conditions usually treated?  \nWe first clean the deep pockets that form between the gums and the teeth or implants. This cleaning is called subgingival instrumentation (also known as scaling and root planing). We use hand or powered tools to remove the sticky plaque that lives below the gum‑line and to smooth the root surfaces. Good oral‑hygiene habits, quitting smoking and, when needed, surgery are also part of standard care.  \n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?  \nIn aPDT a special light‑absorbing chemical (the photosensitiser) is placed into the pocket. A low‑level light then activates the chemical, creating a reaction that kills bacteria. Researchers want to know whether adding aPDT to the usual cleaning gives better results than cleaning alone.  \n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning improves outcomes for adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease. We compared scaling + aPDT with scaling alone (or with a placebo light) and looked at changes after six months in probing depth (the depth of the pocket around a tooth or implant), bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level (how much the supporting tissue has moved), gum recession, bone loss around implants and any side‑effects.  \n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched for randomized controlled trials that compared subgingival or submucosal instrumentation with adjunctive aPDT versus instrumentation alone (or placebo). We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \n- We identified 15 eligible trials involving about 800 participants.  \n- Adding aPDT produced a statistically significant extra reduction in probing depth of about 0.5 mm and a modest gain in clinical attachment level of about 0.3 mm compared with cleaning alone.  \n- In the small number of studies that included dental implants, probing depth around the implant improved by about 0.4 mm.  \n- Microbiological tests showed lower counts of harmful bacteria such as *Porphyromonas gingivalis*.  \n- No serious adverse events were reported. The most common side‑effect was mild, short‑lasting discomfort.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies were small and allowed participants to know which treatment they received, which can introduce bias. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. The way aPDT was delivered varied between trials. Because of these issues, we are not fully confident in the size of the benefit.  \n\nWhat should happen next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for at least six months, and preferably longer. Future research should test aPDT in people with dental implants and should report any side‑effects clearly.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the summary reflects the most recent studies available at that time."
