    "output": "Title: Does estrogen (female hormone) therapy help reduce pelvic organ prolapse (dropping of pelvic organs) symptoms in postmenopausal (after menopause, when periods stop permanently) women?  \n\nKey messages  \n- We found not enough reliable evidence to say whether estrogen therapy (hormone treatment taken as a pill or applied locally) reduces pelvic organ prolapse (POP) symptoms in post‑menopausal women; we could not identify clear benefits or harms.  \n- Small studies that added topical (applied to the surface of the body) estrogen to vaginal pessaries (soft, removable device placed inside the vagina) reported fewer adverse (harmful) vaginal events, and studies that added estrogen to surgery reported fewer postoperative (after surgery) urinary‑tract (organs that make and remove urine) infections, but these findings are very uncertain because the studies had important limitations.  \n- No trials compared estrogen alone with no treatment, placebo (inactive pill), pelvic‑floor muscle training (exercises that strengthen the muscles supporting the bladder, uterus and rectum), pessaries or surgery, so we do not know how estrogen works by itself. Existing studies are few, small, and at high risk of bias (flaws in study design, conduct or analysis). Larger, well‑designed trials that examine medium‑ and long‑term outcomes and cost‑effectiveness (value for money) are needed.  \n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why does it matter?  \nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a condition where the uterus, bladder or rectum (the last part of the large intestine) drops into the vaginal canal. It is common after menopause – about half of women over 50 who have had at least one child experience it. POP can cause pressure, a bulging feeling, trouble with urination or bowel movements, and can limit daily activities and quality of life. Main risk factors are older age, many births, and being overweight. Women usually manage POP with pelvic‑floor muscle training, a vaginal pessary, or surgery.  \n\nHow might estrogen therapy help?  \nEstrogen levels fall after menopause. Some clinicians give estrogen as a cream (topical) or a tablet (systemic, affecting the whole body) hoping it will strengthen the tissues that support the pelvic organs. Estrogen can be used alone or together with a pessary or surgery.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether estrogen therapy – either applied inside the vagina or taken as a pill – improves POP symptoms or causes harms in post‑menopausal women. We compared estrogen (alone or added to other treatments) with no estrogen, placebo or standard care, and we also looked at side‑effects and cost‑effectiveness.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register up to 20 June 2022 for studies that evaluated local or systemic estrogen therapy for POP in post‑menopausal women. We included randomised controlled trials that compared estrogen with placebo or other treatments and reported relevant outcomes. Because the trials reported few comparable data, we could not combine results in a meta‑analysis; we summarised the findings narratively. We assessed the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE (system for rating certainty of evidence) approach.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 14 randomised controlled trials enrolling 1,002 post‑menopausal women with POP of any severity. No study compared estrogen alone with placebo, no treatment, pelvic‑floor muscle training, pessaries or surgery. Three trials added estrogen to a vaginal pessary versus pessary alone, and eleven trials added estrogen to surgery versus surgery alone. All studies were judged at high risk of bias, especially because participants and staff were not blinded, and there were concerns about selective reporting.  \n\nOverall, we have insufficient reliable evidence to tell whether estrogen therapy helps POP symptoms in post‑menopausal women. When estrogen was added to a pessary, fewer women reported adverse vaginal events, but this possible benefit is very uncertain. When estrogen was added to surgery, fewer women experienced postoperative urinary‑tract infections, but again the evidence is very uncertain.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the methods varied. The review does not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest, so we cannot be sure of the findings.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search."
