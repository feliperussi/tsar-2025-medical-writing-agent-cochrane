    "output": "Does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS – a procedure in which mild electric currents are applied to some areas of the skin) relieve period pain in women?\n\nKey messages\n- TENS may lower period pain compared with a placebo (something that looks like the treatment being studied, but doesn’t contain any medicine) or no treatment (a control condition where participants receive nothing extra beyond usual care), but the evidence is low‑certainty and studies did not report any adverse effects (unwanted or harmful side effects).\n- We do not know whether high‑frequency TENS (many pulses per second) works better than low‑frequency TENS (fewer pulses per second), or whether TENS is as effective as common pain medicines such as acetaminophen (a medication that reduces pain and fever, also known as paracetamol).\n- The existing trials are few, small, and rarely measured safety, need for extra painkillers, impact on daily activities, or quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). Larger, high‑quality studies are needed to determine the true benefits, harms and best use of TENS for period pain.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea (often called period pain or menstrual cramps) is painful cramping that many women and girls feel during their monthly periods. The pain can be strong enough to stop school, work, exercise or other daily activities. It occurs because the uterus (the hollow, pear‑shaped organ in a woman's pelvis; also called womb) contracts and releases chemicals that tighten the muscle. Because the pain can affect quality of life, finding safe and effective ways to relieve it is an important health priority.\n\nWhat is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and how might it help?\nTENS is a non‑drug treatment that uses a small battery‑powered device to send gentle electric currents through sticky pads (electrodes) placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents can be delivered at a high frequency (many pulses per second) or a low frequency (fewer pulses per second). We think TENS works by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain and by prompting the body to release its own natural pain‑killers (endogenous opioids – produced inside the body). It may also improve blood flow to the uterus. Because it does not involve medication, TENS could be an attractive option for women who cannot or do not want to take pain‑relieving drugs.\n\nWhat did the f​irst‑hand review aim to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether TENS – both high‑frequency and low‑frequency versions – actually reduces period pain and is safe to use. We compared TENS with a placebo, with no treatment, and with other common pain‑relief options such as acetaminophen or non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In short, we asked: does TENS work better than doing nothing or other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, and does it cause any unwanted side effects?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of databases for randomised trials that compared high‑frequency or low‑frequency TENS with placebo, no treatment or other therapies in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We included studies that reported pain relief or other relevant clinical outcomes. Two reviewers extracted data and combined results using meta‑analysis. We assessed confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach, considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 20 randomised trials that together enrolled 585 women aged 12 to 49 years with primary dysmenorrhoea. All trials compared TENS (high‑frequency or low‑frequency) with placebo or no treatment, with each other, or with active comparators such as acupressure (applying pressure to specific points on the body to relieve symptoms), acetaminophen, interferential current therapy or NSAIDs. The trials mainly reported pain relief and any adverse effects; none examined longer‑term outcomes such as need for extra pain medication, impact on daily activities or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n- High‑frequency TENS probably reduces menstrual pain a little compared with placebo or no treatment, but the evidence is of low certainty.\n- Low‑frequency TENS probably reduces menstrual pain a bit more than placebo or no treatment, also with low‑certainty evidence.\n- We cannot tell whether high‑frequency TENS works better or worse than low‑frequency TENS.\n- When high‑frequency TENS is compared with active treatments such as acupressure, standard painkillers or interferential current therapy, it probably makes little or no difference in pain relief.\n- Low‑frequency TENS does not appear to change pain compared with standard painkillers, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the results because many trials were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies used different populations and TENS settings. These factors increase the risk of bias and reduce certainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies published up to April 2024."
