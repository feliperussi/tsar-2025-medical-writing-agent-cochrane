    "output": "Do skin‑applied mosquito repellents (topical repellents) reduce the risk of malaria infection?\n\nKey messages\n- Applying mosquito‑repellent creams, lotions or sprays to the skin may slightly lower the chance of getting malaria, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; the products were mostly safe, with only occasional mild skin irritation reported (skin reactions).\n- The possible benefit looks larger in high‑risk groups (people such as refugees, forest workers or military personnel who are more likely to be bitten) who do not have access to other malaria control measures, although the data are still weak.\n- We need more well‑designed (carefully planned to avoid bias) and larger studies—especially in high‑risk settings and without other malaria interventions—to confirm whether topical repellents can reliably protect people from malaria and to understand any longer‑term safety issues.\n\nWhy is malaria a problem and how is it usually prevented?\nMalaria is caused by tiny parasites (most often Plasmodium falciparum – the species that causes the most severe disease) that are passed to people when an insect‑borne mosquito bites them. In many tropical areas malaria can cause fever, severe illness and death, making it a major public‑health challenge. The main tools used to stop mosquitoes from biting are long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs – mosquito‑proof bed nets that stay effective for several years) and indoor residual spraying (IRS – spraying the inside walls of homes with a long‑acting insecticide). These methods work well for mosquitoes that bite and rest inside houses, but they do less to stop bites that happen outdoors or early in the evening. Groups such as refugees living in camps, soldiers on deployment or forest workers may not benefit fully from these indoor‑focused measures, leaving a gap in protection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about topical repellents?\nWe wanted to know whether applying skin‑applied mosquito repellents can lower the number of malaria infections and clinical cases in people living in malaria‑endemic regions (areas where malaria is regularly present). Specifically we examined whether repellents work on their own or when used together with existing tools like LLINs or IRS, and whether they are especially helpful for high‑risk populations (groups with a greater chance of getting malaria because of where they live, work or travel). We measured the effect on malaria incidence (the number of new cases over a period) and on the proportion of people who test positive for the parasite, while also checking for any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, CAB Abstracts), trial registries, conference proceedings and contacted organisations and manufacturers for studies up to 11 January 2023. We included studies that met the inclusion criteria (a list of requirements a person must meet to take part in a study) of assessing the effectiveness (how well a treatment works) of topical repellents, either alone or combined with other malaria interventions. Both randomized controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive the treatment or a comparison) and non‑randomized designs that met predefined standards were eligible. Four reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias (how likely a study’s design could have distorted its results). We combined results using meta‑analytic methods and graded our confidence with the GRADE framework (a systematic approach to rate how confident we can be in the results).\n\nWhat did we find?\nCurrent malaria vector control relies on indoor interventions (LLINs, IRS) that are less effective against outdoor or early‑evening transmission. Topical repellents could protect groups less reached by these measures, such as refugees, military personnel and forest workers. The searches identified a small number of eligible studies. When pooled, the data suggested a modest reduction in malaria incidence for users of topical repellents, but confidence in this effect is low because many studies were small, some participants knew which product they received, and not all reported the outcomes we needed. Reported adverse events were limited to occasional mild skin irritation. No serious safety concerns emerged.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew whether they were using a repellent or not (possible bias), and many studies did not provide all the data we were interested in (such as detailed safety information). The overall number of participants was small, and the settings varied, making it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence base is up to date to January 2023. New studies published after this date were not included.\n\nWhat do we need next?\nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that blind participants to the product, include high‑risk populations, and test repellents both alone and together with LLINs or IRS. Such studies should report malaria incidence and safety outcomes over longer periods to determine whether topical repellents can reliably reduce malaria risk."
