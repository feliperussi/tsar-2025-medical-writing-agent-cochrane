    "output": "Title: How are eye‑prescription (refractive) and glasses (optical) services delivered in community and primary‑care settings?\n\nKey messages  \n- In community settings services are mainly provided through school‑based programmes (eye tests at schools), pharmacy‑based services (basic screening and glasses at pharmacies), and outreach models (teams travel to schools or homes). In primary‑care settings (health services that meet most basic health needs over time) the main approaches are vision centres (small local eye‑care facilities), health‑centre based services, and door‑to‑door delivery (providers go to each household). These models aim to increase access to vision correction, but the review found no harmful effects and only limited evidence on their benefits.  \n- The review showed regional variation: school‑based and outreach approaches were most common in the World Health Organization (a United Nations agency that works on global health issues) African region, outreach dominated in the Americas, and very few models were described for the Eastern Mediterranean region. Overall, few studies evaluated how well these approaches work, indicating a gap in knowledge about their effectiveness (how well a treatment works).  \n- Because most identified models have not been rigorously evaluated, future research should assess impact on access, quality of spectacle correction (using eyeglasses to fix blurry vision), cost, and any unintended consequences, especially in under‑reported regions.\n\nWhy does uncorrected refractive error matter for eye health?  \nUncorrected refractive error (a vision problem where the eye does not focus light correctly, causing blurry distance or near vision) – such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism – is a leading cause of vision impairment (a loss of part or all of a physical ability, such as seeing). When the eye cannot focus, everyday tasks like reading, driving or recognizing faces become difficult. Most of these problems can be fixed with the right spectacles. Yet many people worldwide still lack access, leading to avoidable (avoidable) vision loss and reduced quality of life.\n\nHow are refractive and optical care services provided in community and primary‑care settings?  \nWe can bring eye‑care outside specialised hospitals (community care – health services delivered directly within neighbourhoods). In community settings we use:  \n- School‑based programmes (eye tests done at schools).  \n- Pharmacy‑based services (staff provide basic screening and spectacles).  \n- Outreach models (teams travel to villages, schools or workplaces).  \n\nIn primary‑care settings we most often use:  \n- Vision centres (small local eye‑care facilities that offer basic exams and glasses).  \n- Health‑centre based services that include eye checks.  \n- Door‑to‑door delivery that combines vision care with other health services.  \n\nThese approaches aim to bring eye‑care closer to where people live and work. We still need to know which ones work best and how they have been evaluated.\n\nWhat did we want to discover about service‑delivery approaches?  \nWe set out to map the full range of delivery models worldwide (a scoping review – a type of research that maps out all existing evidence on a broad topic) and to examine how researchers have evaluated them. Specifically we asked: (1) what types of models exist of? and (2) what methods have been used to assess their effectiveness.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major bibliographic databases (MEDLINE – a large online library of biomedical articles; Embase – a biomedical literature database; CENTRAL – Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials; Global Health – databases focusing on worldwide health issues), annual reports, and grey literature (information produced outside traditional academic publishing). We applied inclusion criteria (a list of requirements a person must meet to take part in a study) and screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Two reviewers extracted data (information collected from people in a study) and combined the findings in tables (organized rows and columns) and figures (charts or graphs). We appraised confidence using an appropriate framework.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 402 records published between 2002 and 2022: 175 research studies, 146 organisational reports and 81 website records. The evidence covered preschool (early‑childhood education) and school‑aged children as well as adults, and came mainly from the African region and the Americas; few records came from the Eastern Mediterranean region.  \n\nThe delivery approaches fell into two groups. In community settings the most common models were school‑based programmes, pharmacy‑ (pharmacy‑based) services and outreach visits that bring eye‑care to homes or schools. In primary‑care settings the most frequently described models were dedicated vision centres, health‑centre based services and door‑to‑door visits that combine vision care with other health services.  \n\nModel use varied by region. For example, school‑based and outreach programmes were most often reported in Africa, while outreach was the main model in the Americas. Although many descriptions exist, only a few records evaluated whether the models improved vision outcomes. Thus we know many ways services are delivered, but we have little evidence about which ways work best.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost studies were not randomised (people were not placed into groups by chance). This means differences between groups could be due to who was studied rather than the service itself. Studies were often small and used different designs (observational study – watching what happens without intervening; interventional study – assigning a specific treatment). Therefore our confidence in the results is limited.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 (the latest search date).\n\nWhat should future research focus on?  \nWe need well‑designed observational and interventional studies that evaluate effectiveness, cost, equity and any unintended effects of each delivery model. Research should especially target regions with few reports, such as the Eastern Mediterranean region, and should report results in clear tables and figures to aid synthesis (combining results from multiple studies). This will help inform (tell) policymakers and programme planners about the best ways to provide refractive and optical services to those who need them."
