    "output": "Do hormone medicines that block ovarian hormones (GnRH analogues) reduce endometriosis pain without harming bone density?\n\nKey messages  \n- GnRH analogues (medicines that act‑like the hormone GnRH to temporarily stop the ovaries from making estrogen) may lower endometriosis‑related pain, but the evidence is limited and uncertain.  \n- These medicines increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth, often with sweating) and may cause a small loss of bone mineral density (a measure of the amount of minerals, mainly calcium and phosphorus, in bone, used to assess bone strength).  \n- Because the existing studies are few, small, and short‑term, we need larger, well‑designed trials that follow women for longer periods to confirm benefits and safety.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and why does it matter?  \nEndometriosis is a benign condition (a non‑cancerous disorder) where tissue that looks like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or pelvic lining. It affects about 6 %–11 % of women of reproductive age. The tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and difficulty becoming pregnant (infertility). These symptoms lower quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) and can cause emotional distress.\n\nWhat treatments are usually tried for painful endometriosis?  \nWe usually start with pain‑relieving medicines (analgesics) or hormonal therapies that suppress the growth of endometrial tissue. GnRH analogues are one class of hormonal medicines. They lower estrogen production, which can shrink misplaced tissue and reduce pain. A known side‑effect is a decrease in bone mineral density, which can make bones weaker.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to assess how well GnRH analogues relieve painful symptoms of endometriosis and how safe they are. Specifically, we compared these medicines with other hormonal treatments, placebo (a substance that looks like the treatment but contains no active medicine) or no treatment. We looked at overall pain relief, quality of life, the most troublesome symptom, patient satisfaction, bone mineral density and other adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment).\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared GnRH analogues with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment, and with add‑back therapy (a low dose of hormones or other agents given together to protect bone). We pooled results for pain relief, bone mineral density and side‑effects. We rated our confidence in the evidence using the standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 72 trials that enrolled 7,355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues with placebo, the drug danazol (a synthetic androgen), oral or injectable progestogens, and with calcium‑regulating agents used as add‑back therapy. No eligible study compared the medicines with no treatment, analgesics alone, or intra‑uterine progestogens. Most studies reported outcomes after about three months of treatment; a few extended to six or twelve months. The overall quality of the evidence was low because many studies had serious risk of bias and imprecision (uncertainty about the true effect).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n- Pain: GnRH analogues may reduce overall pain slightly compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain and of low quality.  \n- Hot flushes: Women receiving GnRH analogues were more likely to experience hot flushes, with a fairly large increase, but the evidence remains low‑certainty.  \n- Comparison with danazol: Data are very uncertain; we cannot say for sure whether GnRH analogues improve overall pain, although there is a hint they might reduce pelvic pain and pelvic induration (hardening of tissue in the pelvic area) after six months.  \n- Bone health: When given without add‑back therapy, GnRH analogues may cause a small drop in bone mineral density; the certainty of this finding is also very low.  \n- Other outcomes: We found no clear differences for pelvic induration or other symptoms when compared with placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the findings because many studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of performance bias), and follow‑up was short. These factors reduce reliability.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022.\n\nWhat do we need next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that follow women for longer periods. Such studies should compare GnRH analogues with and without add‑back therapy, report pain, quality of life and bone mineral density, and capture all adverse effects. This will help clinicians and patients make informed decisions about using these medicines for endometriosis pain."
