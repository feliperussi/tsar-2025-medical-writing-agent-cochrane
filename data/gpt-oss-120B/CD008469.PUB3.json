    "output": "Title: Do home‑based asthma education programmes help children more than usual care or education given elsewhere?\n\nKey messages  \n- Home‑based education (teaching about asthma in the child’s home) shows little or no clear benefit compared with usual care (the care that a provider would normally give to their patients) for preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (asthma medicine); the evidence is uncertain because only a few small studies exist.  \n- More intensive home‑based education (more frequent or longer sessions) may reduce hospital admissions (being admitted to hospital) compared with less intensive home‑based education, but the evidence is low‑certainty and we saw no clear effect on quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) or school attendance.  \n- Because the current evidence is limited, we need larger, well‑designed randomised controlled trials (research programs conducted with patients to evaluate a new medical treatment) that use consistent outcomes to determine which parts of home‑based education work best, whether benefits last, and whether any harms occur.  \n\nWhat is asthma and why does it matter for children?  \nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs narrow, swollen and extra‑sensitive. This causes wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. About 262 million people worldwide have asthma, many of them children. When a child’s asthma worsens (exacerbation, worsening) they may need urgent care at a hospital or a short course of oral corticosteroids (asthma medicine). Good asthma control lets children breathe easily, go to school, play, and avoid emergency visits. Usual treatments include inhaled preventer and reliever medicines and learning how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen, smoke or pet dander.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to see whether teaching children with asthma and their families about the disease in their own homes improves health outcomes. Specifically, we compared home‑based education with usual care, with education given elsewhere, and with a less‑intensive version of the same home teaching. We looked at how often children needed emergency‑room visits or oral corticosteroids, their quality of life, school attendance, and any hospital stays caused by asthma.  \n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and trial registers up to October 2022. We applied no language restrictions. We included only randomised controlled trials that compared a home‑based education intervention (a treatment, procedure or other action taken to prevent or treat disease) with usual care or another active control in children ≤ 18 years. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study details, participants, intervention components (parts, sections), follow‑up length and on outcomes. We pooled results using a random‑effects model (a way of analysing combined study data that assumes the true effect might differ slightly from study to study). We reported risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and rated confidence in the evidence with GRADE (a system used to rate how confident we can be in the results of a body of research).  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 26 randomised trials that enrolled 5,122 children and teenagers (aged about 1 to 18 years) with asthma ranging from mild to severe disease. All trials used face‑to‑face (in‑person) education delivered in the family’s home. The programmes were compared with usual care or with a less‑intensive education programme delivered outside the home; a few studies also compared a more intensive home‑based programme with a less intensive one.  \n\nWhen we compared home‑based education with usual care, the pooled results showed no clear benefit for preventing emergency‑department visits. The evidence is very uncertain. Home‑based education also made little or no difference to the need for oral corticosteroids, and any improvement in quality of life was small and uncertain.  \n\nWhen a more intensive home‑based programme was compared with a less intensive one, we saw no clear reduction in emergency visits or steroid courses. However, the more intensive programme may greatly reduce the chance of being hospitalised for an asthma flare‑up; this finding is based on low‑certainty evidence. No harmful effects were reported.  \n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in populations and how the education was delivered, and most studies were small. These factors increase risk of bias and imprecision, lowering our confidence in the results.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work. The evidence is current to October 2022, the date of the most recent search."
