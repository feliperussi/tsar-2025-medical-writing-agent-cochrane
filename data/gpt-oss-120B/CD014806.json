    "output": "Does giving sugar (sucrose) help reduce pain from heel‑prick blood tests in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages  \n- Giving a small dose of sucrose (table sugar) right before a heel lance (a quick, tiny prick on a baby’s heel to collect blood) probably eases the baby’s pain in the minutes after key messages. The studies reported no serious side effects, and we have moderate confidence because many trials contributed data.  \n- When we compare sucrose with other soothing methods such as glucose (a simple sugar), expressed breast milk (pumped milk given from a bottle), or skin‑to‑skin care (baby placed on a parent’s bare chest), sucrose shows little or no advantage. Evidence that sucrose is better than non‑nutritive sucking (NNS – letting the baby suck on a clean pacifier), breastfeeding, or other comfort measures is very uncertain.  \n- More well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies that assign babies to groups by chance) are needed to confirm the best approach and to detect any subtle harms.\n\nWhy is pain from heel‑lance procedures a concern for newborn babies?  \nWhen a baby is born, clinicians often need a quick blood sample to check health. The heel lance, although tiny, can cause noticeable pain and distress in neonates (babies up to 28 days old). Babies may cry, grimace, or show changes in heart rate. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect development and make later medical procedures harder. Therefore we look for safe ways to calm babies during these brief but painful.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out about using sugar (sucrose) for pain relief?  \nWe set out to see whether a small amount of sucrose can reduce pain during a heel lance. We compared sucrose with a range of other soothing options, including plain water, glucose, non‑nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, skin‑to‑skin care, music, laser acupuncture (using a low‑level laser instead of a needle), facilitated tucking (gently holding the baby’s arms and legs close to the body), and other comfort measures. Our goal was to determine if sucrose lowers pain scores measured immediately after the prick (using tools such as the Premature Infant Pain Profile – PIPP – which rates facial expression, heart rate, oxygen levels and other cues) and whether it causes any short‑term or longer‑term harms.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science) and three trial registries for randomised controlled trials up to February 2022. We extracted data and combined results using Cochrane methods (strict, internationally recognised procedures for systematic reviews). We calculated mean differences with a fixed‑effect model (a statistical approach that assumes all studies estimate the same underlying effect) and expressed uncertainty with 95 % confidence intervals (a range that likely contains the true effect). We measured variation between studies with the I² statistic (a number that shows how much results differ).  \n\nWhat did we find?  \n- Across the included trials, sucrose consistently lowered pain scores compared with placebo (a harmless substance that looks like the treatment) or no treatment. The average reduction was about 1.2 to 2.5 points on validated pain scales.  \n- The pain‑relieving effect of sucrose was similar to that of non‑nutritive sucking and breastfeeding, but the evidence for these comparisons is very uncertain; we cannot be sure the effects are truly alike.  \n- Sucrose performed better than water or no intervention, and it was comparable to glucose.  \n- No serious adverse events were reported in any trial. Evidence on long‑term outcomes such as neurodevelopment or later pain sensitivity was sparse and inconclusive.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence because the studies involved different types of babies (term neonates – born at 37‑42 weeks, and preterm neonates – born before 37 weeks), used varied dosing methods, and were often small. Some comparisons included only a few trials, which reduces certainty.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies published up to February 2022, so the summary reflects the literature available at that time.  \n\nImplications for practice  \nWe conclude that oral sucrose is an effective, low‑cost option for immediate pain relief during neonatal heel‑lance procedures. Clinicians can consider offering sucrose alongside or as an alternative to non‑nutritive sucking and breastfeeding, especially when other methods are not feasible. Ongoing research should use high‑quality randomised controlled trials and report any subtle harms to strengthen the evidence base."
