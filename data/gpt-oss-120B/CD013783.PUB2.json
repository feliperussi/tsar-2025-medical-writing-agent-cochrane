    "output": "Title: How accurate are toe‑brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD)?\n\nKey messages  \n- We found only a few small, low‑quality studies, so we cannot say how accurate toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are used to detect PAD. The studies did not report any harms.  \n- Both TBI and TSBP are used in everyday practice, but the research is limited, methodologically weak, and varies in how the tests were performed. We therefore lack confidence in their overall diagnostic performance.  \n- We need better‑designed studies that use clear, consistent testing methods, compare the results with reliable reference standards (the best available test used as a benchmark), and assess possible harms.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD (poor blood flow in the legs) occurs when arteries become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). About 236 million people worldwide have PAD, especially older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure (hypertension), type 2 diabetes, or other heart problems. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, tissue death (gangrene), or amputation. PAD also raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes, so early detection is important.\n\nHow are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) used to detect PAD?  \n- **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** – a simple test that compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured at the arm; a lower ratio can indicate poor blood flow to the foot.  \n- **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** – the top number of a blood‑pressure reading taken at the toe, showing the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.  \n\nBoth tests are quick, painless, and can be done at the bedside with a Doppler probe or a digital cuff. We need evidence about how well these tests identify PAD compared with more definitive imaging such as colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) – an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of blood vessels and shows blood flow in real time with colour coding.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe asked two main questions:  \n1. How accurate are TBI and TSBP at diagnosing PAD in the legs? We examined different cut‑off values and how the tests performed in people at risk of PAD.  \n2. Do TBI and TSBP differ in their accuracy? We compared the two tests directly.  \n\nWe also explored whether accuracy varied by population (e.g., people with diabetes), by equipment used, by the threshold chosen for a positive result, or by the reference standard (the best available test used as a benchmark).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched multiple electronic databases without date or language limits. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. We included studies that reported sensitivity and specificity of TBI or TSBP against an imaging reference standard such as CDU or computed tomography angiography (CTA). We extracted data on study design, participants, test thresholds, and 2 × 2 tables. We pooled accuracy data using a bivariate random‑effects model and explored heterogeneity with subgroup analyses. We assessed certainty with the GRADE approach for diagnostic tests.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. TBI was evaluated in about 1,900 participants (2,550 legs) and TSBP in about 700 participants (700 legs). Most studies used colour duplex ultrasound as the reference standard. All studies were judged to be of low methodological quality, and the overall certainty of the evidence was very low. Consequently, we are very uncertain whether using TBI or TSBP improves, worsens, or makes little difference to correctly diagnosing PAD.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe studies were small and often did not blind assessors to the reference test. Not all studies reported data on harms. Because of these weaknesses, we cannot be confident in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies published up to February 2024."
