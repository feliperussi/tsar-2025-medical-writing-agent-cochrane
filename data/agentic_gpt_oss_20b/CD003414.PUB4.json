    "output": "Is a natural menstrual cycle, hormone medication, or ovulation‑inducing drugs the best way to prepare the uterus lining (endometrium) for a frozen embryo transfer?\n\nKey messages\n- Current research shows no clear advantage of a natural cycle, hormone medication (estrogen + progesterone pills), or ovulation‑inducing drugs for preparing the uterus before a frozen‑thawed embryo transfer; live‑birth and miscarriage rates are similar and no safety concerns were identified.\n- Adding GnRHa (a drug that temporarily suppresses the body’s own hormone signals) to hormone medication, or using an hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) trigger in a natural cycle, also does not change success rates.\n- Because the existing studies are small and often poorly reported, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether any method offers better outcomes or fewer harms.\n\nWhat is frozen‑thawed embryo transfer and why do we need to prepare the uterus for it?\nWhen couples undergo IVF, embryos can be frozen and transferred later. This is called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET can increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lower treatment costs and is technically simpler than using fresh embryos. Before we place an embryo in the uterus, we must ensure the uterine lining (the endometrium) is ready to receive it. Doctors can prepare the lining in three main ways:\n– Natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycle – we let the woman’s own menstrual cycle run its course and transfer the embryo when the body naturally builds the lining.\n– Hormone‑therapy (HT) cycle – we give estrogen and progesterone tablets to artificially build the lining.\n– Ovulation‑induction cycle – we use medicines to trigger ovulation, creating a timing we can control.\nSometimes hormone therapy is combined with GnRHa, which temporarily suppresses the woman’s own hormone production. A “modified natural cycle” means a natural cycle in which an hCG injection is given to time ovulation.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare natural cycles, HT cycles (with and without GnRHa), modified natural cycles (hCG trigger) and ovulation‑induction cycles. Our goal was to see which method gives the best live‑birth rates, the lowest miscarriage rates, and the safest outcomes for mother and baby.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared these preparation methods. We combined the results and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 32 trials involving 6,352 women undergoing FET. The trials compared natural cycles, HT cycles (with or without GnRHa), modified natural cycles using an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles.\nFor live‑birth outcomes, a natural cycle may slightly increase the chance of a live birth compared with a hormone‑therapy cycle, but the evidence is uncertain. When hormone‑therapy cycles include GnRHa suppression, a natural cycle probably makes little or no difference to live‑birth rates. Adding GnRHa to hormone therapy or using an hCG trigger in a natural cycle also makes little or no difference to live‑birth or miscarriage rates.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received. Many trials did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies were small with few events.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates previous Cochrane reviews and includes evidence searched up to December 2022."
