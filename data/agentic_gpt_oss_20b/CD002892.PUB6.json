    "output": "Do personal stress‑reduction programs (individual‑level interventions) reduce work‑related stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Personal stress‑reduction programmes can lower reported stress symptoms in the short term (up to 3 months) and in the medium term (up to about a year). The evidence is of low certainty, so we are less sure about the exact size of the benefit, and no long‑term data or harms were reported.\n- Both approaches that help workers focus on their stress (for example, mindfulness) and those that help them shift attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise) appear to reduce stress. Combining several techniques may give a larger short‑term benefit, although we cannot say which type works best.\n- Most studies were small and did not blind participants, so higher‑quality, larger trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm benefits, explore possible harms, and test interventions that target work‑related risk factors.\n\nWhy is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nPeople who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face a mismatch between job demands, their skills and the support they receive from colleagues and managers. This imbalance can cause work‑related stress, which may develop into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective) and physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach problems. Stress can also reduce the quality of care patients receive. While many organisations try to improve working conditions, most stress‑reduction efforts focus on helping the individual – for example, teaching techniques to notice and manage stress, practising relaxation or exercise, or changing personal work habits.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes that target individual health‑care workers can actually lower their stress levels. We compared personal stress‑reduction interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. Our goal was to see which approaches work best, how long any benefit lasts, and whether combining several techniques might be more effective.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several databases for randomised trials that evaluated individual‑level stress‑reduction interventions for health‑care workers. We included studies that compared an intervention with no intervention, a wait‑list, a placebo or another stress‑reduction approach. We combined the results to assess effects on stress symptoms and judged confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 117 randomised trials involving 11 119 health‑care workers. All studies tested individual‑level techniques and compared them with a control condition. We grouped the interventions into four types:\n- Helping people focus on their experience of stress (for example, mindfulness).\n- Helping people shift attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise).\n- Trying to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level.\n- Combining two or more of the above approaches.\n\nThe studies reported outcomes up to 3 months after the programme (short term), between 3 and 12 months (medium term) and beyond 12 months (long term), although many did not provide long‑term data.\n\nWe found that:\n- Focusing on the experience of stress gave a small short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 5 points lower on a 0‑to‑54 scale). The certainty of this effect is low.\n- The same approach may also give a small benefit in the medium term, but the evidence remains uncertain.\n- Shifting attention away from stress produced a moderate short‑term reduction (around 7 points lower). We are unsure how reliable this finding is.\n- In the medium term, the “away‑from‑stress” approach may give a small reduction, but the evidence is still uncertain.\n- Combining several techniques may achieve a moderate short‑term reduction (about 8 points lower). The certainty of this effect is also low.\n\nOverall, individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes can lower stress symptoms for health‑care workers, especially in the short term. The quality of the evidence is limited and long‑term effects are largely unknown.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received and the studies were very small. These factors increase the risk of bias and reduce the reliability of the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to February 2022."
