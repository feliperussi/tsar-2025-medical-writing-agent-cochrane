    "output": "How effective and safe are medicines for treating muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?  \n\nKey messages  \n– Medicines such as mexiletine (a sodium‑channel‑blocking drug) probably reduce muscle stiffness in people with non‑dystrophic myotonia, but they do not show a clear benefit for stiffness in myotonic dystrophy. Common side‑effects are stomach upset, tiredness and headache, and the overall evidence is limited.  \n– Lamotrigine (another sodium‑channel blocker) may help muscles relax faster and may improve overall wellbeing in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence comes from very small studies and is uncertain.  \n– Most trials enrolled few participants and followed them only for a short time, so larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find the best medicines, to identify people who may not respond, and to understand long‑term safety.  \n\nWhat is myotonia and why does it matter?  \nMyotonia is a condition where muscles take longer than normal to relax after a movement. This causes stiffness, cramps, sudden “locking” of the muscles, pain and fatigue. Myotonia occurs in two main groups:  \n\n– **Non‑dystrophic myotonia** – a genetic problem that mainly affects the muscle’s ion channels (tiny gates that control electrical signals) and causes stiffness without other organ problems.  \n– **Myotonic dystrophy** – a systemic disease that adds muscle weakness, heart‑rhythm issues, cataracts and other complications to the stiffness.  \n\nThese symptoms can make everyday tasks such as walking, writing or climbing stairs difficult and lower quality of life.  \n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe asked two questions:  \n\n1. How well do drug treatments reduce the muscle stiffness that people with myotonia experience? We looked for studies that measured patients’ own reports of improvement.  \n2. How well are these drugs tolerated? We examined how often side‑effects occurred and what types they were.  \n\nHow did we do the review?  \nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials (the most reliable type of study) that compared any drug for myotonia with a placebo, no treatment or another active drug. We combined findings on effectiveness and side‑effects and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 17 randomised trials that together enrolled 392 people (219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non‑dystrophic myotonia). Each trial included 9 to 59 participants and was either double‑blind (neither participants nor researchers knew who received the medicine or placebo) or single‑blind. Most studies were small and had a high risk of bias (problems that could affect the results).  \n\n**Mexiletine**  \nIn non‑dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably makes muscles relax faster and may make hand‑grip strength a little stronger. It also often reduces abnormal muscle signals on EMG (electromyography, a test that records the electrical activity of muscles) and could improve overall wellbeing. In myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine shortens the time it takes for a hand to relax after squeezing (hand‑grip relaxation time) but makes little or no difference to overall stiffness or quality of life. Common side‑effects were stomach upset, tiredness and headache.  \n\n**Lamotrigine**  \nLamotrigine may improve how quickly muscles relax and probably improves quality of life in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but it also tends to increase side‑effects such as headache, fatigue and rash.  \n\n**Other medicines**  \nDrugs such as phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam, quinine, diphenylhydantoin and taurine showed little or uncertain benefit, largely because the studies were very small. No trials were found for several drugs that have been suggested for future research (for example acetazolamide, flecainide, ranolazine and lacosamide).  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are fairly confident (moderate certainty) that mexiletine helps non‑dystrophic myotonia and that lamotrigine may help muscles relax, but many studies were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all outcomes were reported. This means the evidence could change as new research appears.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe review includes all relevant studies up to the March 2023 search date.  \n\nOverall, the available research suggests that mexiletine can reduce stiffness in non‑dystrophic myotonia and that lamotrigine may help muscles relax, but the benefits are modest and the evidence is limited. Larger, longer‑term trials are needed to confirm which medicines work best and to understand their safety over time."
