    "output": "Does cleaning the bowel with laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) and taking oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery reduce infections and leaks?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving patients both a laxative bowel cleanse (mechanical bowel preparation) and oral antibiotics before elective colon or rectal surgery probably lowers the chance of a wound infection by about 44 % and the chance of a leak where the bowel is re‑joined by about 40 % compared with a laxative cleanse alone; the evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- We cannot tell whether using oral antibiotics alone, or not preparing the bowel at all, changes infection or leak rates because only a few small studies looked at these comparisons and the evidence is of low certainty.\n- Future trials should compare the combined approach with oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, record side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems, and include a wider range of patients and surgical settings.\n\nWhy is bowel preparation important before planned colorectal surgery?  \nElective colorectal surgery – operations that are planned in advance to remove part of the colon or rectum – can save lives but also carries a risk of serious problems after the operation. The two most worrying complications are:\n- Surgical‑site infection (SSI) – an infection where the incision was made. It can cause pain, delay healing and sometimes need extra antibiotics or another operation.\n- Anastomotic leak – a break where the surgeon re‑joins the two ends of the bowel. A leak can lead to infection inside the abdomen and can be life‑threatening.\n\nThe large bowel normally contains many bacteria. To lower the bacterial load and clear stool before the cut, doctors use pre‑operative bowel preparation. This can be done in two ways:\n- Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) – taking strong laxatives or using enemas to empty the bowel.\n- Oral‑antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB) – swallowing antibiotics that travel through the bowel to kill bacteria.\n\nSometimes both methods are used together (MBP + oAB). Using only the mechanical method has not shown clear benefits, and it has been uncertain whether the combination truly reduces post‑surgical complications.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about combined bowel preparation?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving patients both MBP and oAB before elective colorectal surgery works better than giving MBP alone, oAB alone, or no preparation at all. We focused on outcomes that matter most to patients: surgical‑site infection, anastomotic leak, death, postoperative ileus (a temporary loss of bowel movement), and length of hospital stay.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and trial registries on 15 December 2021. Two reviewers screened every record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane tools. We combined the results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis, which pools data while allowing studies to differ. Then we rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE, a system that grades how certain we are about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n- Surgical‑site infection: The combined MBP + oAB lowered the chance of an SSI by about 44 % (risk ratio 0.56 – the risk was roughly half as high as with a laxative cleanse alone). The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Anastomotic leak: The combined approach lowered the chance of a leak by about 40 % (risk ratio 0.60 – the risk was about 60 % of that with MBP alone). The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Mortality, postoperative ileus and length of hospital stay showed little or no difference between the combined preparation and MBP alone.\n- When we compared the combined method with oAB alone or with no preparation, the effects on SSI, leak, mortality, ileus and hospital stay remained unclear because the evidence is of low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \n- Most trials were small and done at a single centre, which may limit how well the results apply to other hospitals.\n- Definitions of SSI and leak varied between studies, creating some inconsistency.\n- Some trials did not blind participants or outcome assessors, increasing the risk of bias.\n- Most participants came from high‑income countries; results might differ in low- and middle‑income settings.\n- Only a few studies reported side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe latest eligible trial was published before our search date of 15 December 2021. Therefore, the evidence reflects data up to December 2021.\n\nWhat should future research address?  \n- Larger, multicentre trials that use uniform definitions for SSI and leak.  \n- Studies that include low‑ and middle‑income settings to test generalisability.  \n- Direct comparisons of different oral‑antibiotic regimens to find the safest and most effective option.  \n- Systematic reporting of side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems.  \n- Longer follow‑up to assess delayed complications and quality of life."
