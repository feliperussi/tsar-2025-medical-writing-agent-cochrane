    "output": "digital health tools (such as apps, wearables, text messages, active video games, or telehealth) improve weight management in children and adolescents compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n– Adding digital health tools (for example apps, wearables, text messages or video games) to usual care may lead to a small, short‑term reduction in body fat in children and teenagers with obesity; no harms were reported, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Using digital health tools alone, without usual care, did not show a clear benefit for weight‑related outcomes, and the studies did not report any harms.  \n– Because the research includes few participants, short follow‑up periods and little information on side‑effects, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the benefits, identify any risks and see whether effects differ by age, gender or ethnicity.\n\nWhy is childhood obesity a public health concern?  \nBeing overweight or obese as a child or teenager is a global problem. It raises the risk of long‑term illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. In 2016 more than 340 million young people aged 5–19 years were living with excess weight. Traditional management (often called “usual care”) includes advice on healthier eating, encouragement to be more active and regular follow‑up with health professionals.\n\nWhat are digital health interventions for obesity?  \nDigital health interventions are technology‑based tools that help people reach health goals. In obesity they can be wearable devices that track activity, web‑based programmes, text‑message reminders, smartphone or tablet apps, active video‑gaming (“exergaming”) and remote consultations (telehealth). They aim to support diet changes, increase physical activity, or both, and can be used together with usual care or on their own.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether digital health tools help children and adolescents lose body fat or improve other health outcomes compared with usual care alone. Specifically we asked: (1) Does adding digital tools to usual care give better results than usual care by itself? (2) Does using digital tools alone provide any benefit over usual care alone? We also looked at safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched four major databases and two trial registers for randomised studies that tested digital tools for obesity management in people aged 0–19 years. Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system (a method that rates how confident we are that the evidence reflects the true effect). We included only studies that compare a digital tool, with or without usual care, against usual care alone.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 15 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 911 children and adolescents with obesity. Most participants were aged 10–19 years; five trials also included younger children (0–9 years). The trials were conducted in ten countries, most often the United States (5 studies) and Sweden (3 studies). Nine studies lasted less than six months and six lasted six months or longer. The digital tools tested were wearables or implantable devices, web‑based programmes, text messages, mobile or tablet apps, exergaming and telehealth. Eight studies used the digital tool together with usual care, and seven used the tool alone, each compared with usual care alone. No study reported side‑effects.\n\nWhen digital tools were added to usual care, the studies probably reduced body fat slightly – about a 3 % lower amount of body fat compared with usual care alone. When the tools were used alone, we are uncertain whether they change body fat or any other health outcomes. No study reported side‑effects, so we cannot say whether the digital tools cause any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in the result that digital tools plus usual care may reduce body fat, because the number of studies is small and the follow‑up periods are short. The evidence for digital tools used alone is very uncertain. Many studies did not report side‑effects or describe the theoretical basis of the intervention, which limits our ability to judge safety and understand how the tools work.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe literature search was completed in April 2025, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
