    "output": "Do treatments such as hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises) or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) help prevent or slow kidney disease in people with sickle‑cell disease (a blood disorder)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- We found that current studies do not provide clear evidence that hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors prevent or slow kidney disease. They may give a small benefit to the kidneys’ ability to concentrate urine, but they did not change serious sickle‑cell complications such as chest problems, painful episodes, or hospital stays, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- We also found no suitable trials of red‑blood‑cell transfusions, and no trials that included older children or adults. Because of this, we lack evidence for these groups.\n- We conclude that larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods are needed to determine whether any of these medicines truly protect kidney function and to assess possible side effects.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle‑cell disease?\nSickle‑cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where the oxygen‑carrying protein in red blood cells is abnormal. This makes the cells stiff and shaped like a sickle, which can block tiny blood vessels. When vessels in the kidneys are blocked, the tiny filtering units become damaged. Early damage shows up as microalbuminuria (tiny amounts of protein in the urine) and can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the kidneys work poorly for at least three months. CKD can later lead to end‑stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or a transplant. Because kidney damage can start in childhood and worsen with age, protecting the kidneys is a major health priority for people with SCD.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe set out to discover whether any of the following treatments can prevent or slow kidney damage in SCD:\n- Hydroxyurea – a medicine that reduces the number of sickle‑shaped cells.\n- Angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – drugs that lower blood pressure in the tiny vessels of the kidney and are used to protect kidneys in other diseases.\n- Red‑blood‑cell transfusions – giving healthy blood cells to replace sickle cells.\n\nWe asked whether these treatments, alone or together, improve kidney function, reduce protein loss in the urine, or lower the risk of serious kidney‑related complications.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched trial registers and databases for randomised controlled trials that compared hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors or transfusions with placebo or usual care in people with SCD. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants:\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged about 9 to 18 months.\n- One trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure but microalbuminuria.\n- One trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years who also had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria.\n\nThe reports did not give details about how long participants were followed, where the studies were conducted, or who funded them. The evidence is uncertain. Hydroxyurea may help the kidneys concentrate urine a little, but we do not know whether it improves glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of the kidneys’ filtering ability. Hydroxyurea probably makes little or no difference to serious SCD complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisations. For ACE inhibitors, we do not know whether they reduce protein loss in the urine of adults or children, and we have no data on overall kidney function.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because the trials were small and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which can introduce bias. Not all outcomes we were interested in were reported, and the evidence does not cover older children, adults, or all SCD genotypes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe abstract did not state a specific date for the literature search, so we cannot confirm how up‑to‑date the evidence is. Ongoing trials are being conducted, but their results are not yet available."
