    "output": "Is regular exercise effective for people with chronic vein disease (poor vein circulation) that has not caused open skin sores (ulcers)?\n\nKey messages\n– We could not confirm that regular exercise improves symptoms or prevents ulcers in people with chronic vein disease without ulcers; the few small studies we found were of low quality.  \n– Some studies hinted that exercise might boost quality of life, leg‑muscle strength, and walking ability, but these results are very uncertain.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine any real benefits or harms of exercise.\n\nWhy does chronic venous insufficiency matter and what did the review aim to find?  \nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not return blood to the heart efficiently (poor vein circulation). This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and may eventually lead to a painful open sore (ulcer). Even before an ulcer appears, many people feel uncomfortable, have trouble walking or standing, and report a lower quality of life. Current treatments such as compression stockings, medication, or surgery often leave symptoms unchanged.  \nWe set out to find out whether structured physical‑exercise programmes help people with CVI who have not yet developed ulcers. Specifically, we looked for evidence that exercise could reduce symptom severity, improve the calf‑muscle pump (how well the muscles push blood back to the heart), shorten the time veins take to refill with blood (venous refilling time), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, strength, and mobility. We also checked whether any harms were reported.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?  \nWe searched several medical databases up to March 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared an exercise programme with no structured exercise in adults with CVI without ulcers. Two reviewers independently screened the records, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified five trials involving 146 participants. The exercise programmes varied in type, frequency, and duration, and follow‑up ranged from eight weeks to six months. The studies did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and the methods used to measure outcomes differed, so we could not combine the data in a meta‑analysis.  \nOverall, the evidence was unclear whether exercise changes the severity of signs and symptoms, improves the calf‑muscle pump, shortens venous refilling time, enhances health‑related quality of life, increases walking capacity, boosts muscle strength, or improves ankle mobility. No study showed that exercise prevented the development of leg ulcers. Importantly, none of the trials reported serious harms from the exercise programmes.\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?  \nWe are not confident in the results because the trials were small, some participants knew which group they were in, and the studies used different populations and exercise protocols. Several trials also had methodological problems that increase the risk of bias.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates a previous Cochrane review and includes all relevant studies published up to March 2022."
