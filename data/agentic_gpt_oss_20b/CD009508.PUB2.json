    "output": "\"What is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle training (exercises that strengthen the muscles that stop urine leakage) for women with urinary incontinence?\\n\\nKey messages  \\n– Direct pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) – repeated, isolated voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles – probably gives a small improvement in how women feel about their urinary leakage, while adding other types of exercises or doing coordinated movements (body movements performed together with pelvic‑floor contractions) shows little or no extra benefit; serious side‑effects are rare and mainly occur when a training device is used.  \\n– Training more often (more days each week) and receiving supervision (either in a clinic or through e‑health, which means communication with clinicians via a mobile app) may improve quality of life, but the evidence comes from only a few small studies and is therefore uncertain.  \\n– Because many studies were small, had methodological problems, and gave inconsistent results, we need more well‑designed research to determine the optimal type, dose, and delivery of PFMT for women with urinary incontinence.  \\n\\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter for women?  \\nMany women experience unwanted leakage of urine, a condition called urinary incontinence. It can happen in three main ways:  \\n– Stress incontinence – leaking when coughing, sneezing, or lifting something heavy;  \\n– Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be held;  \\n– Mixed incontinence – a combination of stress and urgency leakage.  \\n\\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, and reduce quality of life. Up to one in three women experience incontinence as they get older, making effective management a public‑health priority.  \\n\\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training and how is it usually delivered?  \\nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles that support the bladder and help control urination. PFMT teaches women to repeatedly tighten (contract) these muscles, much like doing a Kegel exercise.  \\n\\nResearchers have tried PFMT in several ways:  \\n– **Exercise type** – some programmes use direct PFMT (isolated, voluntary pelvic‑floor squeezes) while others add indirect exercises that involve other body movements or combine both approaches.  \\n– **Exercise dose** – programmes may use resistance devices, vary the number of sessions per week, or use stronger (maximal) versus milder (sub‑maximal) squeezes.  \\n– **Delivery method** – training can be supervised in a clinic, taught for home practice, delivered individually or in groups, or provided through e‑health tools such as smartphone apps that let women communicate with clinicians.  \\n\\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \\nWe wanted to compare the different ways PFMT can be performed. Specifically, we asked whether changing the type of exercise, the amount (dose) of training, or the method of delivery leads to better quality of life for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. We also recorded any side‑effects.  \\n\\nHow did we conduct the review?  \\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference proceedings, and reference lists. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence.  \\n\\nWhat did we find?  \\nWe included 63 randomised trials involving 4 920 women. Most participants were aged 45–65 years, had given birth, and mainly suffered stress or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. All trials compared a direct PFMT arm (repeated, isolated pelvic‑floor contractions) with an alternative approach.  \\n\\n**Exercise type**  \\n– Coordinated training (body movements with simultaneous pelvic‑floor squeezes) may improve quality of life slightly.  \\n– Direct PFMT alone may improve quality of life moderately.  \\n– Adding indirect exercises to direct PFMT makes little or no difference.  \\n\\n**Exercise dose**  \\n– Using a resistance device versus no device gave uncertain results.  \\n– Doing PFMT on more days per week may produce a large improvement in quality of life (based on one small trial).  \\n\\n**Delivery method**  \\n– Clinic supervision may slightly improve quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \\n– Individual supervision probably makes little or no difference compared with group supervision.  \\n– Supervision via e‑health may improve quality of life slightly.  \\n\\nAdverse‑event data were reported in nine trials. About six out of every 100 women experienced a mild event, such as vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort from a training device. Serious side‑effects were rare.  \\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \\nMany trials were small and had methodological problems, such as unclear allocation or lack of blinding. Data were sparse for several comparisons, and results were often inconsistent. Because of these issues, we have low confidence in many of the findings.  \\n\\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \\nWe updated our previous review and included all evidence up to September 2023."
