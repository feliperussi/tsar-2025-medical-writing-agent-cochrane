    "output": "Does audit and feedback (measuring clinicians' performance and giving them the results) improve professional practice?\n\nKey messages\n- Audit and feedback can produce modest improvements in how clinicians work, and no harmful effects were reported; the overall certainty of the evidence is moderate.  \n- The impact is larger when feedback is given to individual clinicians, includes a trusted local champion, uses both spoken and written formats, compares performance with top‑performing peers, and provides clear action plans. Many studies also added education or reminders as extra support.  \n- More high‑quality research is needed to fine‑tune the design of audit and feedback, especially in different health‑care settings and over longer periods.  \n\nWhy is improving healthcare professionals’ practice important?  \nClinicians decide which medicines to prescribe and which tests to order every day. When these decisions do not follow the best evidence, patients may receive care that is less effective, more costly, or even harmful. Practice varies widely between hospitals and clinics, so some patients get better care than others. An audit (a systematic check of what clinicians actually do) and feedback (a clear report of those results, often compared with a target or top peers) help clinicians see where they could improve and encourage higher‑quality care.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether audit and feedback really help clinicians improve their practice and, if so, how big the improvement is. We also examined which features of audit and feedback programmes—such as giving individual‑level data, involving a local champion, using interactive formats, or adding an action plan—make the interventions work better.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases for randomised trials that tested audit‑and‑feedback interventions on health‑professional practice. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and explored factors that might influence the effect with meta‑regressions. We rated the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 292 trials (678 intervention groups). Most participants were doctors; the main behaviours targeted were prescribing medicines (47 % of trials) and ordering tests (35 %). The studies were mostly from high‑income countries; only 9 % were from low‑ or middle‑income settings. Many interventions combined audit and feedback with additional support activities (called co‑interventions, such as education sessions or reminder systems).  \n\nWhat were the main results on professional practice?  \nAudit and feedback probably improves practice a little. About 6 out of every 100 clinicians are likely to change their behaviour when audit and feedback is used. The effect is probably bigger when feedback is given to individual clinicians rather than whole teams, when performance is compared with top peers, when a trusted local champion supports the clinician, when feedback uses both verbal and written formats and encourages interaction, and when clear, specific action plans are provided. Adding co‑interventions such as education or reminders also increases the benefit.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Some studies may have been aware of their group allocation, which can influence behaviour. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the interventions varied in who delivered them and how they were presented.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies published up to June 2020."
