The evidence is very uncertain and no harmful effects were reported.  \n– Some studies suggest that home‑based teaching may improve quality of life (overall well‑being and daily functioning) and that a more intensive home programme might lower the chance of hospital admission, but these findings are also uncertain.  \n– The existing trials differ a lot in how they were carried out and are generally of limited quality, so more well‑designed research using consistent outcomes is needed.\n\nWhat is asthma and why does it matter for children?  \nAsthma is a long‑term lung condition and makes the airways swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. When asthma gets worse (an “exacerbation”) a child may need urgent care, a short course of strong medicines called oral corticosteroids, or a hospital stay. These attacks disrupt school, sleep and daily activities and can be stressful for families.\n\nWhy might teaching families at home help?  \nGood asthma care includes learning how the disease works, how to avoid triggers (such as dust, pollen or smoke) and how to use inhalers correctly. Home‑based education can reach families who have trouble traveling to a clinic because of limited money or transport. It also lets educators see the home environment and spot everyday triggers. We do not yet know whether this approach improves outcomes compared with usual care given elsewhere.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe aimed to determine whether face‑to‑face (in‑person) asthma education provided in the home reduces important outcomes for children aged 2–18 years. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based programmes lower the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑room visits or require oral corticosteroids, and whether they improve quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospitalisations compared with usual care, waiting‑list control or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several databases up to October 2022 for studies that randomly assigned families to either home‑based education or the usual care they receive in a clinic. Two reviewers selected the studies, extracted the data and used the GRADE system (a tool that tells us how confident we can be in the results) to rate certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 26 trials that together included 5 122 children and adolescents (ages 1–18 years). All trials compared face‑to‑face, home‑based education (given to the child, the caregiver, or both) with usual care. Some trials used waiting‑list controls, and others used a less‑intensive education programme delivered outside the home or with fewer home visits. The reports did not give details about where the trials were conducted, who funded them, or participants’ gender and other demographics.\n\nWhat are the main results for emergency‑department visits?  \nProviding home‑based asthma education probably does not reduce the number of emergency‑department visits. The evidence for this is very uncertain. Even when the education programme is more intensive, the effect on emergency‑department visits remains likely to be little or none, with the same high level of uncertainty.\n\nWhat do we know about other outcomes?  \nEvidence for improvements in quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospitalisations is also very uncertain. Some studies hint at a possible benefit for quality of life and a lower chance of hospital admission with more intensive home programmes, but the certainty is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the results because participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies used different methods, and many trials were small. These factors increase uncertainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates a previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022."
