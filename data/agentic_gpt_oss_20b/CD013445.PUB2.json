    "output": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a skin‑through kidney stone removal surgery) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a scope‑through‑the‑ureter procedure) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nKey messages\n– PCNL may increase the chance of being stone‑free by about 10 % and may reduce the need for extra procedures by about 15 % compared with RIRS.  \n– Major complications (serious side‑effects that require additional treatment or hospital care) appear similar for both procedures.  \n– PCNL may lead to a hospital stay that is roughly one day longer than RIRS. The evidence is limited, so our confidence in these findings is modest.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and trigger infections. Treatment depends on stone size, location, composition, and the patient’s health. Options include watching the stone, using shock‑wave lithotripsy (a machine that breaks stones into small pieces), or performing minimally invasive procedures. Two common procedures are:\n– Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision in the back allows a tube (nephroscope) to enter the kidney and remove the stone.  \n– Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed through the urethra, bladder and ureter into the kidney, where a laser fragments the stone.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about PCNL and RIRS?\nWe compared PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n– Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (no visible stone fragments).  \n– Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects).  \n– Reduces the need for secondary interventions (extra procedures after the first treatment).  \n– Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury or strictures (narrowing of the tube that carries urine), unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and two trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We combined results with a random‑effects model.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 42 trials that enrolled 4 571 adults with stones ranging from about 10 mm to 39 mm. The trials used standard PCNL (≥24 Fr), mini‑PCNL (15–23 Fr) or ultra‑mini/micro‑PCNL (<15 Fr). No study reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\n– Stone‑free rate: PCNL probably increases the proportion of patients who become stone‑free by about 10 % (roughly 10 more per 100 treated).  \n– Major complications: PCNL probably makes little or “no” difference; about 1 fewer serious complication per 100 patients compared with RIRS.  \n– Secondary interventions: PCNL probably reduces the need for extra procedures by about 15 % (around 15 fewer per 100 patients).  \n– Hospital stay: PCNL probably adds about one day to the average stay.  \n– Ureteral strictures or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference; about 1 fewer case per 1 000 patients.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in many results because most trials were small, some did not conceal treatment allocation, and participants and clinicians often knew which procedure was used. Details about participants’ ages, gender, settings, follow‑up length, funding and conflicts of interest were frequently missing.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence includes all studies published up to March 2023."
