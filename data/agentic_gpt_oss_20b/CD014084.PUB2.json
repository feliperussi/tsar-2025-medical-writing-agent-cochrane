    "output": "Does sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) improve nose symptoms and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease) who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function (how well the lungs work) in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps, because only one small study with limited data was found; the only serious harm reported was a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.  \n– The limited evidence does not show clear benefits of surgery on reducing bacterial colonisation (bacteria living in the nose).  \n– The evidence also does not show clear benefits on antibiotic use, pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung disease), or hospital admissions.  \n– Larger, well‑designed studies that follow participants for at least a year are needed to determine whether sinus surgery truly helps nasal and lung outcomes and to assess any long‑term risks or benefits.  \n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose and lungs?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes body fluids thick and sticky. The thick fluid blocks tiny tubes in many organs, including the lungs and the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose). When the sinuses cannot drain, people with CF often develop chronic rhinosinusitis – long‑lasting inflammation of the sinus lining – and nasal polyps, which are soft, painless growths inside the nose. These problems can cause a blocked nose, difficulty breathing through the nose, and may worsen lung infections because the sinuses can hold bacteria that travel to the lungs.  \n\nWhy might surgery be used to treat sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\nEndoscopic sinus surgery uses a thin camera and small instruments to open blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps. By clearing the sinuses, medicines such as nasal rinses or antibiotics can work better, which might reduce nose symptoms and lower the risk of lung infections.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe were interested in whether adding sinus surgery – either alone or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes compared with medical treatment alone. Specifically, we wanted to know if surgery helps:\n1. Nasal symptoms and the amount of bacteria in the nose.  \n2. Lung function.  \n3. Hospital stays, antibiotic use, and episodes of worsening lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations).  \n4. Overall survival.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with CF, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We combined the results of the studies we identified and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.  \n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 28 participants aged 19 to 28 years. The trial compared nasal irrigation alone (medical treatment) with nasal irrigation plus surgery that removed polyps and opened the sinuses. The study did not report participants’ gender, disease severity, study length, location, or funding, and it did not provide data on survival. We do not know whether adding sinus surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers antibiotic use, decreases pulmonary exacerbations, or improves lung function. One bleeding episode occurred during surgery and was managed without further problems.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is very limited because it comes from a single, small study. The study does not represent all people with CF, nor does it cover all outcomes we were interested in. Consequently, we have low confidence in the results.  \n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe searches were last run in September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
