    "output": "Does an exercise programme for heart failure patients (exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation) improve survival, lower hospital admissions, and enhance quality of life in adults?\n\nWhat are the main findings?  \n- Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation, a supervised exercise programme for people with heart failure, does not change the chance of dying.  \n- The programme probably reduces hospital admissions and improves health‑related quality of life; no harmful effects were reported.  \n- The evidence is modest, so we have only moderate confidence in these conclusions.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why does it matter?  \nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood as well as it should. This leads to shortness of breath, tiredness and fluid buildup, making everyday activities difficult. People with heart failure often have limited ability to exercise, a lower health‑related quality of life (HRQoL), a higher risk of death, and frequent hospital admissions. These problems also increase health‑care costs.\n\nWhat is exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation and how is it usually delivered?  \nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise programme for heart failure) uses activities such as walking, cycling or resistance training to improve heart function and overall wellbeing. We can deliver the programme in a clinic or hospital (centre‑based) or at home, sometimes with digital support. Some programmes include only exercise, while others add education, psychological support or medication advice. Most previous studies enrolled men with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF – the heart’s pumping ability is below 45%). Women, older adults and people with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF – the heart pumps normally but fills poorly) have been under‑represented.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether taking part in exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation, compared with usual care that does not include exercise, changes the risk of death, the chance of being admitted to hospital, and the health‑related quality of life for adults living with heart failure. We also examined whether the setting (centre‑based vs home‑based) or the inclusion of additional support influences these outcomes.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the evidence?  \nWe searched six databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science) up to 13 December 2021. We included randomised controlled trials that compared exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation with usual care in adults (≥ 18 years) with heart failure, and that followed participants for at least six months. Two reviewers extracted data on mortality, hospital admissions and HRQoL, and we used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 60 trials involving 8 728 participants. The median follow‑up was six months. Most participants had HFrEF and were classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III. Women, older adults and people with HFpEF were less common, although newer studies are beginning to include them. Trials were conducted mainly in centre‑based settings, with an emerging group delivering the programme at home or via digital platforms.\n\n- Hospital admissions: Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of any hospital admission. For every 100 people with heart failure, about eight fewer are admitted when they join the programme (moderate certainty). It also probably reduces heart‑failure‑related admissions by roughly one fewer admission per 100 people (moderate certainty).  \n- Health‑related quality of life: The programme probably improves how participants feel about their health and daily activities (moderate certainty).  \n- Mortality: The evidence does not show a clear difference in overall death rates; the programme may make little or no difference to mortality (low certainty).\n\nThe benefits were similar whether the programme was centre‑based or home‑based, and whether it included only exercise or also education and other support.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have modest confidence in the findings because many trials were small, some participants knew which group they were in, and the evidence does not fully represent older adults, women or people with HFpEF. Few trials reported long‑term outcomes, so we cannot be certain about effects beyond the short term.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes all evidence up to December 2021."
