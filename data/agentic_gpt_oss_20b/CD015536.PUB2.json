    "output": "Is the antiviral medicine entecavir (a drug that blocks hepatitis B virus) better than no treatment or a dummy pill for children and adults with long‑term hepatitis B?\n\nKey messages\n– Current research does not show a clear benefit of entecavir (a medicine that blocks hepatitis B) compared with no treatment or a dummy pill. The trials reported no deaths and gave very uncertain information about serious side‑effects.  \n– The studies also did not report how entecavir affects daily life (quality of life).  \n– Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we need larger, well‑designed studies that follow patients for longer periods to determine whether entecavir improves survival, reduces serious side‑effects, or enhances quality of life.\n\nWhy is chronic hepatitis B a major health problem?\nHepatitis B is a virus that infects the liver. When the infection lasts a long time (called chronic hepatitis B), it can cause serious liver damage, liver cancer, and death. Around one‑third of the world’s population has been exposed to the virus, and millions live with chronic infection, often feeling well for years while the virus silently harms the liver.\n\nWhat is entecavir and how is it used to treat hepatitis B?\nEntecavir belongs to a group of medicines called nucleos(t)ide analogues – drugs that look like the building blocks of viral DNA and stop the virus from copying itself. Because it works well and is usually safe, many clinical guidelines recommend entecavir as a first‑choice treatment for chronic hepatitis B in both children and adults. Patients take the tablet by mouth to keep the virus at low levels and reduce liver damage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether taking entecavir is beneficial and safe compared with receiving no treatment or a placebo. We looked at both children and adults, regardless of whether they were positive or negative for hepatitis B e‑antigen (HBeAg – a marker that shows how active the infection is). We focused on three important outcomes: death from any cause, serious side‑effects, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched several databases and trial registries for randomised trials that compared entecavir with no treatment or placebo in people with chronic hepatitis B. We combined the results where possible and used the GRADE system to rate how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 22 randomised trials that together enrolled 2,940 participants with chronic hepatitis B. All trials compared oral entecavir with either no treatment or a placebo for periods ranging from 5 weeks to 228 weeks. Twelve trials used no treatment as the comparator and ten used a placebo. Fourteen trials gave the same additional care to both groups. Most participants were adults; one trial enrolled only children and another enrolled people aged 14‑55 years. No trial reported quality‑of‑life outcomes. We could not estimate the effect on death because no deaths occurred in either group. We are very uncertain about the evidence for serious side‑effects because only a few events happened and many trials had problems with how they were done (risk‑of‑bias concerns).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because some participants may have known which treatment they received, many trials were small, and several did not provide data for the outcomes we wanted.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur search covered studies published up to July 2024, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time."
