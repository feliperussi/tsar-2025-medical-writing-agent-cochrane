    "output": "\"Is silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that stops cavities) effective for preventing and treating tooth decay in children and adults?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new cavities on the roots of teeth (cavities on the roots of teeth, below the gum line) and may stop existing cavities in baby teeth from getting worse.\n– When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish (a protective fluoride coating applied to teeth), we find little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes.\n– The studies were small and often did not report important side effects such as tooth staining, so we need better research to know the true benefits and harms of SDF.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?  \nDental caries, also called tooth decay, is the most common disease worldwide. Bacteria produce acids that wear away the hard parts of a tooth, creating a cavity. If a cavity is left untreated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, lower confidence, and lead to more serious health problems. Caries can affect baby teeth (primary dentition) and adult teeth (permanent dentition). Cavities may appear on the visible crown of the tooth (coronal? Actually keep as is) or on the root that lies below the gum line (root caries).\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how might it help?  \nSDF is a liquid that contains two active ingredients: silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which helps rebuild enamel. We can paint SDF directly onto a cavity or onto a tooth at risk of developing a cavity. Because it is easy to apply and does not require drilling, SDF offers a low‑cost, simple option for preventing new cavities or stopping existing ones, especially for people who have limited access to dental care.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF works better, the same, or worse than doing nothing, using a placebo, or using other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants (protective coatings on chewing surfaces), or atraumatic restorative treatment (ART – a simple filling). We also examined whether SDF caused side effects, pain, or unwanted tooth staining.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised trials that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the results and rated and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 29 trials that together included 13,036 participants (about 12,000 children and 1,000 older adults). All trials applied SDF to teeth and compared it with doing nothing, a placebo, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or ART.\n\nWe found that SDF probably reduces new root cavities and may also stop existing cavities in baby teeth from getting worse. When we compared SDF with fluoride varnish, we found little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth. We are very uncertain about any other differences because the studies were small and gave mixed results. We do not know if one way of applying SDF works better than another. We are also uncertain whether SDF (SDF) is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART for stopping cavities in baby teeth.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany participants knew which treatment they received, the trials were small, and they involved different types of people and delivery methods. Important outcomes such as tooth staining were reported in only a few studies, so we cannot be confident about harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to June 2023."
