    "output": "Do preventive antibiotics (antibiotics given before a miscarriage procedure) lower the risk of infection after the procedure?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may lower the chance of a uterine infection, but the overall evidence is uncertain; high‑quality studies suggest a 43 % reduction.\n– Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are not sure whether they increase allergic reactions.\n– Evidence is very uncertain about whether antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be needed during procedures for early pregnancy loss?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (also called a miscarriage), doctors often need to remove any remaining tissue from the uterus. This procedure is called a uterine evacuation. Removing tissue can let bacteria enter the uterus and cause a serious infection. If a woman already shows signs of infection (for example fever or pain), doctors give antibiotics to treat it. It is unclear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful. Giving antibiotics to prevent infection is called prophylactic (preventive) use.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?\nWe wanted to know whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a harmless pill (placebo) or no treatment. We also looked at whether routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases and trial registers for studies up to October 2023. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted the data, and used a simple system called GRADE (which helps us judge how confident we are in the results) to assess our certainty. All the included studies were randomised controlled trials – a type of study that randomly assigns participants to receive either the antibiotic or a harmless placebo (or no treatment).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies. In total, they included 4 371 women who had a surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. All the studies only included women who did not have any signs of infection.\n\n– Overall, routine antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection (low‑certainty evidence).  \n– When we looked only at the three studies judged to be at low risk of bias, antibiotics reduced infections by about 43 % (high‑certainty evidence).  \n– Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate‑certainty evidence) or diarrhoea (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n– They may increase allergic reactions, but the evidence is of low certainty.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for additional antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection (very low certainty).\n\nWhat are the evidence’s limitations?\nWe have little confidence in the results because some studies were unblinded (participants knew which treatment they received), not all outcomes were reported, the participants and methods varied, and only a few studies were available.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
