    "output": "Is video laryngoscopy (using a camera to view the airway) more effective than direct laryngoscopy (looking directly with a tube) for inserting breathing tubes in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages\n– Using video laryngoscopy may increase the chance that the first attempt to place a breathing tube succeeds and may reduce the total number of attempts.\n– Video laryngoscopy does not clearly shorten the time needed to achieve a successful tube placement.\n– Video laryngoscopy probably lowers the risk of airway injury, but we are uncertain whether it changes low‑oxygen episodes (desaturation) or slow heart rate (bradycardia). The overall evidence is limited because the studies were small and had design problems.\n\nWhy is securing the airway in newborn babies a critical problem?\nWhen a baby is born, especially if it is very small or ill, clinicians may need to help the baby breathe by inserting a tiny tube into the windpipe – a procedure called endotracheal intubation. The tube keeps the airway open so the baby can receive oxygen. Delays can cause low oxygen levels, a slow heart rate, or other serious complications. The traditional method uses a direct laryngoscope, a metal blade that the clinician looks through directly. A video laryngoscope adds a small camera that shows a live video of the airway on a screen, which may give a clearer view of the vocal cords and make tube placement easier and safer.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared video laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy to see which method works better and is safer for newborns aged 0‑28 days. Specifically, we asked whether the video device reduces the time needed to place the tube, lowers the number of attempts required, and increases the chance of success on the first attempt. We also examined whether the video method leads to fewer episodes of low oxygen (desaturation), slow heart rate (bradycardia), or injury to the airway.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries for randomized (or quasi‑randomized) trials that compared video laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in newborns. We combined the results for success rates, number of attempts, and time taken, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials that together reported 759 intubation attempts in newborns of either sex. The studies used video devices such as C‑MAC, Airtraq, or Glidescope.\n\n– Time to successful intubation: Video laryngoscopy made little or no difference compared with direct laryngoscopy, and the evidence is uncertain.\n– Number of attempts: Video laryngoscopy probably reduced the number of attempts. About 14 more infants per 100 were successfully intubated on the first try, although this benefit is small and uncertain.\n– First‑attempt success: The video device likely increased the chance of success on the first attempt.\n– Airway injury: Video laryngoscopy probably lowered the risk of injury, with roughly 4 fewer infants per 100 experiencing trauma.\n– Desaturation or bradycardia: The effect on low‑oxygen episodes or slow heart rate is very uncertain.\n– Lowest oxygen saturation recorded: Video laryngoscopy may make little or no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings because many studies were small and clinicians knew which device they were using, which can introduce bias.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to November 2022.\n\nWhat should future research address?\nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that confirm the potential benefits of video laryngoscopy, assess safety outcomes more comprehensively, and explore whether any advantages persist over time."
