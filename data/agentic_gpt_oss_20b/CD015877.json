    "output": "Are personalized nutrition plans (precision nutrition) more effective than standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight?\n\nKey messages – Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of personalized nutrition over standard diet advice for weight loss in children and teenagers.  \n– No side effects were reported, but the certainty of the evidence is very low because only a few small studies exist.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials that also measure mental‑health outcomes and follow participants for longer are needed.\n\nWhy is obesity in children and teenagers a health problem?  \nBeing overweight or obese means having excess body fat for one’s height and age. In people up to 19 years old this can lead to type‑2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, joint problems and lower self‑esteem. It also raises the chance of staying overweight in adulthood. Most current approaches – general diet advice, physical‑activity programmes, medication or surgery – are the same for every child, a “one‑size‑fits‑all” strategy.\n\nWhat is meant by “precision nutrition” and how might it differ from usual diet advice?  \nPrecision nutrition tries to tailor diet recommendations to each child’s unique characteristics. This can include genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the microbiome), health status, socioeconomic background and activity level. Computer‑based decision‑support tools combine this information and then give a diet plan that is specific to the individual, rather than giving the same advice to everyone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether precision‑nutrition interventions help children and adolescents with overweight or obesity lose weight or improve body‑mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) compared with usual, non‑personalised diet advice or no special intervention. We also looked at effects on overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life and any side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched many databases up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared precision‑nutrition interventions with usual care in children (0‑9 years) or adolescents (10‑19 years) who were overweight or obese. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). We combined the results using a simple statistical method that treats the studies as similar.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two trials (105 participants) from Ukraine and Greece. One trial enrolled 35 children aged 0‑9 years and the other enrolled 30 adolescents aged 10‑19 years; data from 65 participants were used for the main outcomes.  \n\nIn children aged 0‑9 years, the personalized nutrition programme may have lowered BMI by about 1.4 kg/m² and weight by about 2.6 kg, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n\nIn adolescents aged 10‑19 years, the same programme may have raised BMI by about 3.0 kg/m² and weight by about 11.4 kg, again with very uncertain evidence.  \n\nWe did not find any adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe studies were very small and only two trials are available, so we cannot be confident in the results. Follow‑up was short and the outcomes reported were limited.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence is current to July 2024."
