    "output": "Do self‑management programs (teaching people to manage their vision loss) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment?\n\nKey messages\n– Current research shows that self‑management programs probably make little or no difference to overall quality of life (how a person feels and functions day‑to‑day) or to vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities) for adults with visual impairment, and we found no evidence of increased harmful side effects. The evidence is limited and uncertain.  \n– Most studies involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration, and none examined people who have both sight and hearing loss, so the findings may not apply to all groups with visual loss.  \n– More high‑quality research is needed. Future studies should use more sensitive ways to measure quality of life, include a broader range of participants, and follow people for longer periods.\n\nWhy is visual impairment a health concern for many adults?  \nLoss of vision (significant loss of sight) affects more than 2.2 billion people worldwide, most of them older adults. When vision worsens, everyday tasks such as reading, cooking, or moving around become harder. This can reduce independence, lower mood, and lower overall well‑being, making visual impairment a major public‑health problem.\n\nWhat are self‑management interventions for people with visual impairment?  \nSelf‑management interventions are programmes that teach people how to cope with their vision loss on their own. They may include training in low‑vision aids (devices that help people see better), strategies to stay active, problem‑solving skills, and emotional support. The goal is to help individuals maintain daily activities and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether these self‑management programmes actually improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared the programmes with doing nothing (a wait‑list) or with usual care, looking at two outcomes: health‑related quality of life (how health affects everyday life) and vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities and well‑being). We also checked whether the programmes caused any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases and trial registries up to May 2024 for randomised trials that compared self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with visual impairment. We combined the quality‑of‑life results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 20 randomised trials that enrolled 3 151 older adults (mean age 60–84 years) with visual impairment, most often caused by age‑related macular degeneration. The programmes were multi‑component and aimed to improve daily functioning and well‑being. Compared with wait‑list or usual‑care controls, the programmes probably make little or no difference to health‑related or vision‑related quality of life, and they do not increase the risk of side effects. The evidence is of low certainty because the studies were small and varied in participants and delivery methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and used different participants and delivery methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence we summarised is current to May 2024, the date of our most recent search."
