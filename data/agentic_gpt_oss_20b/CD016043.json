    "output": "What are the different ways to deliver eye‑care services (vision tests and glasses) in community settings and primary‑care clinics?\n\nKey messages\n- We found several ways to provide eye‑care outside hospitals. In community settings the most common were school‑based programmes (services delivered at schools), pharmacy‑based services (offered in drugstores), and mobile outreach teams that travel to villages. In primary‑care clinics the main approaches were vision centres (dedicated eye‑exam rooms within health facilities), health‑centre‑based vision services, and door‑to‑door delivery (eye‑care brought directly to people’s homes).\n- We did not find any harmful effects, but only a few studies measured how well these models work. Evidence is especially limited in the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n- Future research should test each model’s impact on access, quality of vision testing, and any unintended consequences so that WHO member states and other stakeholders can make informed decisions.\n\nWhy is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\nMany people cannot see clearly because the shape of their eyes does not focus light properly – this is called a refractive error (think of a camera that is out of focus). When the error is not corrected, it becomes a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Glasses or contact lenses can fix most cases, yet millions of people, especially in low‑resource communities, lack eye tests or affordable spectacles. This limits learning, work, and daily activities and makes it harder to meet the World Health Assembly target to increase the number of people receiving effective eye care by 40 percentage points by 2030. Effective coverage means the share of people who need glasses and actually receive the right prescription and suitable spectacles.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to map all the ways eye‑care services – from vision testing to providing glasses – are delivered outside hospitals. Specifically we looked at community settings (schools, pharmacies, mobile outreach) and primary‑care settings (health‑centre vision clinics or door‑to‑door visits). We also examined how researchers have evaluated these delivery models and where evidence gaps exist.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched four major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health), grey literature, and reports from organisations that work on eye‑care. We included studies, reports, and website records published between Jan 2002 and Nov 2022 that described refractive or optical services for children or adults in community or primary‑care settings. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and resolved disagreements through discussion.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe screened 402 records that met our criteria: 175 primary studies, 146 organisational reports, and 81 website records. The most common community models were school‑based programmes, pharmacy‑based services, and outreach teams that travel to villages. In primary‑care clinics, the main approaches were vision centres, health‑centre‑based vision services, and door‑to‑door delivery.\n\nRegional patterns emerged. School‑based and outreach models were frequent in the African region, outreach dominated in the Americas, and very few models were reported from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Only a small number of studies actually evaluated the effectiveness of these models, so we cannot say which improve vision outcomes. We did not find any harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because few studies measured outcomes and the data do not cover all populations of interest. Many records omitted details such as total participant numbers, ages, genders, or severity of refractive error.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched for evidence up to November 2022, so the review reflects the literature available at that time."
