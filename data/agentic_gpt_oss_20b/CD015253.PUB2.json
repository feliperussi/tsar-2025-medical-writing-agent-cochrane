    "output": "Is using a nasal balloon (autoinflation) better than doing nothing for children with fluid‑filled ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n\nKey messages\n- Autoinflation (blowing into a small nasal balloon to create pressure) may give a modest boost to ear‑related quality of life and may slightly lower the number of children who still have fluid in the middle ear.\n- The evidence does not show a clear benefit for restoring normal hearing, and we are not sure whether autoinflation increases ear pain.\n- The studies were small and short‑term, so our confidence in these findings is low.\n\nWhat is otitis media with effusion and why does it matter for children?  \nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a build‑up of fluid in the middle part of the ear. It is very common in young children. The fluid can block sound, causing temporary hearing loss. When hearing loss lasts, children may find it harder to pay attention, may develop behavioural problems, and may fall behind in language development. The middle‑ear space connects to the back of the nose through the Eustachian tube. If this tube does not open properly, fluid can stay trapped.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about autoinflation for OME?  \nWe wanted to know whether autoinflation is an effective and safe way to treat OME in children. Specifically, we looked at whether the technique helps children:\n- regain normal hearing,\n- improve ear‑related quality of life,\n- experience less pain or distress, and\n- clear middle‑ear fluid more quickly.\nWe compared autoinflation with doing nothing (watchful waiting) or with other non‑surgical treatments and we recorded any harms such as ear pain or eardrum damage.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and other sources up to 20 January 2023. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that enrolled children aged 6 months to 12 years with OME. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 11 trials that enrolled 1 036 children. All trials compared a self‑administered autoinflation method (nasal balloon or handheld device) with no treatment. Children performed autoinflation two to three times a day for 2–12 weeks. Outcomes were measured soon after treatment; the longest follow‑up was 11 weeks.\n\n- Hearing: The evidence does not show a clear benefit of autoinflation for restoring normal hearing.\n- Quality of life: Autoinflation may lead to a modest improvement in ear‑related quality of life.\n- Ear pain: The evidence is of very low certainty, and one small study suggested that ear pain might be more common with autoinflation, but we are not sure.\n- Fluid persistence: The evidence suggests that autoinflation might slightly lower the number of children who still have fluid in the middle ear, but we do not know whether this small difference matters in practice.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe trials were small, used different devices, and mostly included children older than infants. Because the studies varied and followed participants for only a short time, our confidence in the results is low.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?  \nYes. Our search covered studies published up to January 2023, so the summary reflects the most recent research available at that time."
