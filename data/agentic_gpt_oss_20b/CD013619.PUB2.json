    "output": "Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental health problems?\n\nKey messages\n- Small studies suggest that letting relatives watch emergency resuscitation (CPR) may lower later symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD – a condition that can cause flash‑backs, anxiety and trouble sleeping), as well as reduce anxiety, depression and intense sorrow (complicated grief). The studies were few, small and had design problems, so we cannot be sure the results are reliable.  \n- One small pilot study also looked at whether family presence changed how long resuscitation lasted or added stress for health‑care staff; it found no clear differences.  \n- Because the existing trials have important limitations, we need larger, well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.\n\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?\nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as a heart stop, families often wish to stay close. They may want to help with treatment decisions, to say goodbye, or simply to offer support. Health‑care teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside because they fear that seeing the emergency procedures (called resuscitation – attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting. Understanding how family presence influences stress reactions helps us create policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to answer two main questions. First, we wanted to know whether offering a relative the choice to watch resuscitation reduces the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms. Second, we examined whether family presence changes other outcomes:\n- mental‑health of relatives (anxiety, depression, complicated grief);\n- patient health (how sick they become – morbidity – and whether they survive – mortality);\n- how emergency care is delivered;\n- stress levels and attitudes of health‑care professionals.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We included randomised trials that compared family presence during resuscitation with usual practice, either in emergency departments or in pre‑hospital (before the patient reaches the hospital) settings. Two reviewers extracted the data and we combined the results narratively because a meta‑analysis was not possible.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised trials involving 595 adult relatives (ages 19‑78, 56‑64 % women).  \n- A large cluster‑randomised trial (a study where whole groups, such as ambulance teams, are assigned together) in France (2013) offered relatives a systematic option to witness CPR in pre‑hospital ambulance teams and followed them for up to one year.  \n- A small pilot trial in the United Kingdom (1998) compared family presence with usual practice in an emergency department.  \n\nBoth trials measured PTSD symptoms. After 12 months, relatives who watched CPR reported fewer PTSD symptoms, lower anxiety, lower depression and less intense sadness. The UK pilot found no difference in resuscitation duration or staff stress. Because the studies were small and had methodological problems, we judged the overall certainty of the evidence as very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nParticipants knew whether they were present, which may have influenced how they reported feelings. The trials were small, had risk of bias and did not report all outcomes we were interested in. These weaknesses mean we cannot be confident in the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were up to date as of March 2022. New studies may have been published since then."
