    "output": "Is bronchoscopy (a lung‑looking procedure that collects fluid)‑guided antibiotic treatment better than standard throat‑swab‑based treatment for children with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n– Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment (using fluid collected from the lower airways) does not show clear advantages over standard treatment based on throat swabs for children with cystic fibrosis; lung function, CT scan scores (detailed lung images), quality of life and bacterial clearance are similar, while the invasive procedure may lead to more hospital stays and temporary worsening of cough.  \n– The findings come from two small randomised trials that enrolled preschool‑aged children; the bronchoscopy procedure can cause a short‑term increase in cough and, in rare cases, rapid clinical deterioration shortly after the test.  \n– Because the evidence is limited, we need larger, longer‑term studies that include older children, adolescents and adults to determine any long‑term benefits, costs and safety of bronchoscopy‑guided treatment.\n\nWhy is treating lung infections in cystic?  \nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that makes thick, sticky mucus build up in the airways. The mucus creates a niche where bacteria thrive, leading to chronic lung infections that damage lung tissue over time. Early detection and targeted antibiotics are essential to preserve lung function. Many young children cannot produce sputum (spit) samples, which are the usual source for identifying the infecting bacteria. When sputum is unavailable, clinicians often rely on oropharyngeal (mouth‑throat) swabs, which may miss bacteria living deeper in the lungs and result in suboptimal antibiotic choices.\n\nWhat is bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and how might they improve infection detection?  \nBronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which a flexible tube (bronchoscope) is passed through the nose or mouth into the lower airways. During bronchoscopy, clinicians introduce a small amount of sterile fluid into a lung region and then recollect it; this process is called bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The recovered fluid contains cells and microbes directly from the lower respiratory tract, providing a more accurate snapshot of the bacterial population than upper‑airway samples. Using BAL results to guide antibiotic selection—referred to as a bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy—has the potential to target the true pathogens more precisely.\n\nWhat did the systematic review aim to determine about bronchoscopy‑guided therapy?  \nWe set out to evaluate whether choosing antibiotics based on BAL findings leads to better clinical outcomes than selecting drugs based on symptoms and oropharyngeal cultures. We focused on lung function, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung symptoms), quality of life, adverse events and healthcare costs in children and adults with CF.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, three study registries and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest search was on 1 November 2023. Two reviewers independently selected randomised controlled trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two randomised controlled trials that together enrolled about 200 children with CF.  \n\n– One large trial followed 170 infants (under 6 months old) from birth until age five, providing complete data for 157 children.  \n– The smaller trial randomised 30 children aged 5–18 years.\n\nBoth trials compared BAL‑guided therapy with standard care based on clinical signs and throat or oropharyngeal cultures.  \n\nLung function  \nBoth groups had similar forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) after two years and after five years. This indicates that bronchoscopy‑directed therapy made little or no difference to lung function at both time points.\n\nOther outcomes  \n– CT scan scores (detailed lung images) were similar between groups.  \n– Quality‑of‑life measures showed no difference.  \n– Bacterial clearance was comparable.  \n– The bronchoscopy group experienced more hospital admissions per year.  \n– About 29 % of bronchoscopy procedures were followed by a temporary increase in cough.  \n– In rare cases (≈5 % of procedures) children showed rapid clinical deterioration within 24 hours of BAL.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence because the trials were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, some data were missing, and the studies involved different ages and interventions. These factors limit how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to November 2023."
