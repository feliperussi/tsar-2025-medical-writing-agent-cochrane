    "output": "\"Is magnetic seizure therapy (a brain‑stimulation treatment) as effective and safer than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\"\n\nKey messages\n– The only study we found did not show a clear advantage for magnetic seizure therapy (MST) over electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in overall schizophrenia symptoms. MST might cause fewer problems with delayed memory (trouble remembering things later) and could improve thinking abilities (cognitive function), but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n– The review is based on a single small trial that had several design problems, so our confidence in the findings is low.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatments) are needed to determine whether MST truly offers any benefit over ECT.\n\nWhy is schizophrenia a challenging health problem?  \nSchizophrenia is a common, serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves. It can cause hearing voices, holding strange beliefs and losing interest in everyday activities. These symptoms often make work, study and relationships difficult, leading to high disability. Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and why might it help?  \nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive brain‑stimulation technique. It uses brief, strong magnetic pulses to create a short seizure in the brain, similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) but without the electric currents that can cause more side‑effects. Researchers hope MST can improve schizophrenia symptoms while causing fewer memory and other cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether MST is effective and safe for people with schizophrenia. Specifically we compared MST (alone or added to standard care – the usual treatment a person receives) with ECT or other treatments. We looked at overall mental state, positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations), negative symptoms (e.g., reduced motivation), thinking abilities, side‑effects and how many people stopped treatment early.\n\nHow did we search for studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s register (which includes CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed and WHO ICTRP) up to 6 March 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared MST with other treatments in schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified one four‑week randomised trial that enrolled 79 adults experiencing a severe flare‑up of schizophrenia (called “acute schizophrenia”). The study compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The report did not say where the trial was done, who funded it, or details about the participants such as age or gender.  \n\nThe results were uncertain. We could not tell whether MST improved overall condition, symptom scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, delayed‑memory problems, overall thinking ability, any cognitive improvement, or whether people left the study early for any reason, because of side‑effects, or because the treatment seemed ineffective, when compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the findings because participants likely knew which treatment they received, the study was small, and it did not report all outcomes we wanted.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to the March 2022 search."
