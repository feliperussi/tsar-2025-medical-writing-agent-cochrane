    "output": "Does giving sweet sugar solution (sucrose) reduce pain from heel‑prick tests in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving a small dose of sucrose probably lowers pain scores when we compare it with no treatment or water. The evidence is of moderate certainty and no serious side effects were reported.  \n– When we compare sucrose with other soothing methods such as non‑nutritive sucking (a pacifier without milk), breastfeeding, glucose, or skin‑to‑skin care, the evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot tell which method works best.  \n– Future research should look at longer‑term outcomes, include both term and pre‑term infants, and directly compare sucrose with other pain‑relief approaches.\n\nWhy does heel‑lance pain matter for newborn babies?  \nClinicians often need a tiny drop of blood to check a baby’s health. They obtain the sample by quickly pricking the heel – a procedure called a heel‑lance. Even though the needle is small, the prick can cause noticeable pain and distress in full‑term and pre‑term infants. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby’s comfort, sleep, and later pain responses. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, clinicians use pain‑rating tools such as the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP – a scale that looks at facial expression, crying, and heart rate) and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS – a similar tool) to measure pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving a tiny dose of sucrose (table sugar) before a heel‑lance reduces a baby’s pain. We compared sucrose with no treatment, water, or placebo, and also with other soothing methods such as non‑nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, glucose, expressed breast milk, skin‑to‑skin contact, laser acupuncture, and facilitated tucking. We examined immediate pain scores and any longer‑term outcomes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science) and three trial registries up to February 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared sucrose with any of the listed alternatives in newborns undergoing heel‑lance. Two reviewers extracted data and used the GRADE approach to rate confidence in the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 55 trials that together enrolled 6 273 newborn babies. Twenty‑nine trials enrolled only full‑term infants, 22 enrolled only pre‑term infants, and four included both groups. All babies underwent a heel‑lance; some trials also looked at other minor painful procedures.\n\n– **Sucrose vs no treatment or water**: Moderate‑certainty evidence shows that sucrose probably reduces PIPP scores by about 1.7 points at 30 seconds and by about 2.1 points at 60 seconds after the prick.  \n– **Sucrose vs non‑nutritive sucking (NNS)**: The evidence is very uncertain; we cannot say whether sucrose is better, worse, or the same as NNS.  \n– **Sucrose vs glucose, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care with water**: The evidence suggests little or no difference in pain scores (low to very low certainty).  \n– **Sucrose vs breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking**: The evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot determine which method works best.  \n– **Sucrose combined with NNS vs NNS alone**: The evidence is very uncertain about any added benefit.\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported in any trial.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the overall findings, but the trials differed in the types of babies studied, the exact dose and timing of sucrose, and the way pain was measured. This variability reduces our certainty for some comparisons.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nOur search covered studies published up to February 2022. Any trials published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat should happen next?  \nFuture studies should use well‑designed randomised trials that follow babies for longer periods, include both term and pre‑term infants, and directly compare sucrose with other soothing techniques. This will help clinicians choose the most effective and safest method to ease heel‑lance pain in newborns."
