    "output": "Is a minimally invasive repair with a graft that has holes (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery or watchful waiting for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulging of the main abdominal artery)?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a graft with holes to keep blood flowing to important arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR – a traditional operation that opens the abdomen) or watchful waiting (also called conservative management) because no randomised trials comparing these approaches were found, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.\n- Research on complex AAAs is difficult. The condition is rare and the aneurysms vary a lot in shape and location, making it hard to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.\n- Future work should focus on well‑designed randomised trials that compare FEVAR with OSR or watchful waiting and that follow patients for longer periods to assess survival, complications and quality of life.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a concern?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall stretches, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs need treatment. Complex AAAs are those that are close to the kidney arteries (renal arteries), making repair more difficult.\n\nWhat are the usual ways to treat AAAs?\n- Open surgical repair (OSR): a surgeon makes a large cut in the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube. This works well but involves a big operation and a long recovery.\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR): a less‑invasive method where a thin, tube‑like graft is threaded through the blood vessels to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows (fenestrations) that line up with the renal arteries (the blood vessels that supply the kidneys), allowing blood to keep flowing to the kidneys without opening the abdomen.\n- Watchful waiting (also called conservative management): we monitor the aneurysm without surgery, usually when the risk of an operation outweighs the benefit.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether FEVAR is a safer or more effective option compared with OSR or with watchful waiting. Specifically, we looked for randomised trials that reported:\n- Death within 30 days and after one year (overall and aneurysm‑related)\n- Length of hospital stay after the procedure\n- Kidney injury, need for additional procedures and whether the graft stays open\n- Patient‑reported outcomes such as quality of life and side‑effects\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. We screened all records, applied our inclusion criteria and extracted any relevant data.\n\nWhat did we find?\nNo eligible trials were found, so we could not combine results or judge how reliable the evidence is. Because no studies met our criteria, no participants were enrolled and we have no information about study size, funding, participant characteristics, settings or details of the interventions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it does not cover the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are too few studies to be certain about any result.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
