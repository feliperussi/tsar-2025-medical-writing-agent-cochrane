    "output": "What are the benefits and challenges of healthcare workers using their personal mobile phones (their own phones) and other devices to support their work?\n\nKey messages\n– Using a personal phone lets staff be more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients, and can keep some patient information out of weak official systems.  \n– Personal phone use can cost workers money, add work after hours, risk patient privacy and create inequities, especially for lower‑level staff.  \n– In many settings the practice has become normal, creating pressure to be constantly reachable, causing distractions and a hidden “shadow IT” system – that is, unofficial technology that stores and shares information outside the official health records.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones and other devices at work?  \nIn many facilities the official ways to communicate and share information are missing, broken or too slow. Front‑line staff – doctors, nurses, community health workers and others who see patients every day – have to make important decisions with limited tools. To fill the gap between what is expected of them and what the workplace provides, they often reach for phones, tablets or other gadgets they already own. A personal device can make them more flexible, allow quicker answers to patients and help keep sensitive information out of unreliable official systems.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about these informal mobile‑device practices?  \nWe wanted to understand how healthcare workers, their managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal mobile phones and other devices to support daily work. By gathering qualitative studies from around the world, we aimed to identify the benefits, the challenges and the broader implications of these unofficial, innovative solutions for staff and patients.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined informal mobile‑device use. After extracting the findings and grouping similar ideas, we assessed how confident we are in each result using a straightforward rating system (GRADE‑CERQual) that shows the strength of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and professional groups. Most reports focused on personal mobile phones rather than tablets.  \n\nOur findings show that using their own phones makes healthcare workers more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Personal devices also help workers keep some patient information out of unreliable official systems and allow more personal, socially appropriate communication with colleagues and patients.  \n\nAt the same time, personal phone use creates new problems. Workers often have to pay for calls or data themselves, and lower‑paid staff feel a heavier financial burden. Storing patient information on a personal phone can put privacy at risk and may keep that information out of official records, creating a hidden “shadow IT” system. Using phones after hours adds extra workload and makes it hard to ignore work calls at home. Frequent alerts can also distract staff from patient care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nAll of the evidence comes from qualitative studies, which may not capture every perspective. Many primary reports omitted details such as participants’ ages, genders or exact numbers, so we could not assess how representative the findings are across all health‑worker groups.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe ran our searches in August 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date."
