    "output": "Do primary health workers (clinic staff) and community health workers (local volunteers) prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\n\nKey messages\n– Primary‑level and community‑worker programmes can produce small improvements in anxiety, stress‑related symptoms, depression, quality of life and daily functioning; no harmful effects were reported.  \n– The studies are few and many have methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in these modest benefits is limited.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm benefits, check for possible harms and identify the best ways to deliver these programmes.\n\nWhy is mental health a concern in low‑ and middle‑income countries?  \nMany people in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience stress, anxiety, depression or other mental‑health problems, but they often cannot reach professional services. There are not enough trained doctors or psychologists, resources are unevenly distributed, and stigma – the fear of being judged for having a mental‑health issue – can stop people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, preventing mental disorders and promoting well‑being before problems become severe is especially important.\n\nWhat are primary‑level and community‑worker interventions?  \nPrimary‑level workers are health staff who work in basic health centres, such as nurses or general practitioners. Community workers are local volunteers, teachers or lay health aides who receive training to deliver health programmes. Using these workers to deliver mental‑health programmes is called “task‑shifting” – moving tasks from scarce specialists to a broader workforce. This approach can help reach more people with preventive support and early treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several databases for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) of primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention programmes in LMICs. We pooled the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias (how likely a study’s results are affected by problems in how it was done) and GRADE criteria (a system we use to judge how confident we can be in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 113 studies that together involved 32 992 participants. Researchers carried out the trials in low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income settings. Both adults (83 studies) and children (30 studies) took part. Primary‑level workers delivered the programmes in 38 studies, community workers in 71 studies, both types in 2 studies, and the provider was not reported in 2 studies. The programmes fell into three categories:  \n\n– universal promotion (offered to everyone, 22 studies)  \n– selective prevention (targeting people at higher risk, 36 studies)  \n– indicated prevention (targeting people who already show early signs of a disorder, 55 studies)  \n\nWe usually compared the programmes with usual care and evaluated outcomes at three time‑frames: 0‑1 month, 1‑6 months and 7‑24 months after the intervention.\n\nMain results  \n\nAdults  \n– Universal promotion probably reduced anxiety a little (moderate confidence).  \n– Universal promotion may have reduced distress or PTSD symptoms slightly (low confidence).  \n– Selective prevention probably reduced depressive symptoms a little (moderate confidence).  \n– Indicated prevention probably reduced functional impairment (difficulty with daily activities) a little (moderate confidence).  \n\nChildren  \n– Universal promotion may improve quality of life slightly (low confidence).  \n– Universal promotion may reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms a little (low confidence).  \n– Selective prevention probably reduced depressive symptoms a little (moderate confidence).  \n– Indicated prevention may reduce functional impairment slightly (low confidence).  \n\nNo study reported any harmful effects.\n\nHow sure are we about these findings?  \nWhen we say the evidence “probably” shows an effect, we have moderate confidence that the effect is real. When we say it “may” show an effect, our confidence is lower and the evidence is less certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies did not blind participants to their group, some did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies varied in the people they included and how the programmes were delivered. These issues lower our confidence in the size of the benefits.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to November 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat does this mean for future research?  \nFuture work should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up to confirm the benefits, check for any possible harms and identify the most effective ways to implement worker‑delivered interventions in different settings."
