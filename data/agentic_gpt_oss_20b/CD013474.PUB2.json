    "output": "Is continued (maintenance) treatment better than just watching (observation) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?\n\nKey messages  \n– Maintenance therapy after remission does not seem to make people live longer, but it probably keeps the disease from getting worse for a longer time (progression‑free survival).  \n– Anti‑CD20 antibodies (lab‑made proteins that target cancer cells, such as rituximab or ofatumumab) and lenalidomide (a drug that modifies the immune system) both delay disease progression, yet each raises the chance of serious side‑effects and of any side‑effects overall. Lenalidomide may also slightly increase treatment‑related deaths (deaths that occurred because of side‑effects from the maintenance drug).  \n– Evidence on newer targeted drugs is very limited, and we have little information about patients’ day‑to‑day wellbeing (health‑related quality of life).\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?  \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults. It occurs when a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte grows out of control and builds up in the blood, bone‑marrow and sometimes the spleen. Current treatments cannot cure CLL, and each new line of therapy tends to work for a shorter time before the disease returns. After an initial treatment many people enter remission – a period when the disease is not actively growing. Because remission often does not last long, doctors sometimes use maintenance therapy – a lower‑intensity, ongoing treatment given after remission to try to keep the disease under control for a longer time. Options include monoclonal antibodies (lab‑made proteins that target specific markers on cancer cells, such as CD20 or CD52), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system, e.g., lenalidomide), and newer targeted drugs that block signals the cancer cells need to survive.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about maintenance therapy for CLL?  \nWe wanted to know whether maintenance treatments – anti‑CD20 antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, anti‑CD52 antibodies, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, or B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (BCL‑2) inhibitors – improve important outcomes for people with CLL. Specifically we looked at overall survival (how long people live), progression‑free survival (how long the disease stays stable before it gets worse), health‑related quality of life (day‑to‑day wellbeing), and the frequency of side‑effects or harms.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers. We looked for randomised trials that compared a maintenance treatment with simply watching the disease (observation) or with another maintenance option. We extracted data on survival, disease progression, side‑effects and quality of life, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search covered studies published up to January 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eleven randomised trials that together enrolled 2,393 participants with CLL. Most participants were men (about 60%) and their ages ranged from 54 to 72 years. The trials examined three kinds of maintenance treatment:  \n– Anti‑CD20 antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation (7 trials, 1,679 participants)  \n– Lenalidomide versus placebo or observation (3 trials, 693 participants)  \n– Alemtuzumab (an anti‑CD52 antibody) versus observation (1 small trial, 21 participants)  \n\nNo trials evaluated newer targeted agents such as BTK or BCL‑2 inhibitors.  \n\nOur analysis shows that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably do not change overall survival – they likely make little or no difference to how long people live. Both treatments probably increase progression‑free survival, meaning the disease stays stable for a longer period before getting worse. Each treatment also probably raises the risk of serious side‑effects and of any side‑effects overall. Lenalidomide may slightly increase treatment‑related deaths. Evidence on alemtuzumab’s effect on disease progression remains very uncertain, and we found almost no data on quality of life.\n\nHow certain are we about these findings?  \nWe have moderate confidence in the results. Some trials were small, participants often knew which treatment they received, and the study populations varied. These limitations mean the true effect could differ from our estimates.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?  \nWe last searched the literature in January 2022, so the summary reflects studies published up to that date. Newer trials may have been reported since then."
