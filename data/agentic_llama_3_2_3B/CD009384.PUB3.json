    "output": "Zinc supplements may help reduce the risk of diarrhea and support growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, but the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure. There is no clear evidence that zinc supplements cause serious harm in children. More research is needed to investigate the effects of zinc supplements on children with chronic diseases or conditions, and on children who are hospitalized. Future studies should focus on the long-term effects of zinc supplements and how they work in different populations, including children with zinc deficiency.\n\nZinc supplementation probably has little to no effect on all-cause mortality in children aged 6 months to 12 years. It may reduce deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and malaria, but the evidence is unclear, and it likely increases the risk of vomiting slightly. Zinc probably reduces the incidence of all-cause diarrhea and probably has little to no impact on morbidity from lower respiratory infections. Additionally, zinc supplementation probably leads to a small increase in children’s height.\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.\n\nZinc supplementation in children 6 months to 12 years provides a protective effect against mortality and diarrheal disease and yields modest gains in linear and ponderal growth. The evidence supports incorporating zinc into child health and nutrition programs, especially in settings with high zinc deficiency risk.\n\nKey Messages:\n- Zinc supplements may help reduce the risk of diarrhea and support growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to say for sure, and more research is needed.\n- Zinc supplementation probably has little to no effect on all-cause mortality in children aged 6 months to 12 years.\n- It may reduce deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and malaria, but the evidence is unclear, and it likely increases the risk of vomiting slightly.\n- Zinc probably reduces the incidence of all-cause diarrhea and probably has little to no impact on morbidity from lower respiratory infections.\n- Additionally, zinc supplementation probably leads to a small increase in children’s height.\n- We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small.\n- The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.\n- Zinc supplementation in children 6 months to 12 years provides a protective effect against mortality and diarrheal disease and yields modest gains in linear and ponderal growth.\n- The evidence supports incorporating zinc into child health and nutrition programs, especially in settings with high zinc deficiency risk."
