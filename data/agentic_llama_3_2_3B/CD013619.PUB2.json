    "output": "Does having family members present during CPR affect relatives? The review found that offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients may reduce the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives, anxiety, depression, and complicated grief after 1 year. However, the evidence for all outcomes except one was assessed as very low certainty. There was insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) on relatives."
