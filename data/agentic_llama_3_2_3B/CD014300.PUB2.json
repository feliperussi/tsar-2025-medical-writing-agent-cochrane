    "output": "I can help you with that. Here is the revised text in a plain language summary format:\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nPeople living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises are at risk of mental health problems due to wars, conflicts, persecutions, human rights violations, and humanitarian crises. Psychosocial interventions may be helpful to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning, ...\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting mental health versus control conditions (no intervention, intervention as usual, or waiting list) in people living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review directly addresses the aims, summarizing the core actions taken by the authors, and notes the study design only in a brief parenthetical explanation.\n\n**Study Characteristics**\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations, indicating that the process did not converge or lacked a proper termination condition. This typically occurs when the agent is caught in a loop or when the iteration limit is set too low for the task at hand.\n\n**Findings Summary**\nThe intervention appears to have little or no effect on mental well-being for both adults and children at the study endpoint, and also little or no effect on children’s prosocial behaviour. However, it probably leads to a large reduction in functioning. Data on acceptability (drop-out rates) were not reported, and the evidence for medium-term effects on mental-well-behaviour is very uncertain. There remains a substantial gap in research on mental health promotion in humanitarian settings.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n**The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.**"
