    "output": "**Do physical interventions (actions to stop virus spread) reduce respiratory infections?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Physical interventions (actions to stop virus spread) probably make little or no difference to the outcome of respiratory viral illness (including influenza and COVID-19) compared to not wearing masks (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Wearing N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks may be effective for clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low-certainty evidence).\n- Hand hygiene interventions probably modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but this effect was not found to be significant for laboratory-confirmed influenza.\n- There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs addressing the effectiveness of many of these interventions in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of ARIs.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nViral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat. Examples are influenza (H1N1) caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus in 2009, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) caused by SARS‑CoV‑2 in 2019. Antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread.\n\n**What do we want to find out?**\nWe want to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. Specifically, we want to know which physical interventions are most effective in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses; how well these interventions work in different settings and populations; and what factors affect their effectiveness.\n\n**Study Overview**\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We combined the results of 11 new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes, to answer our aims.\n\n**What did we find?**\nCommunity mask use likely has little or no effect on ILI/COVID-19 outcomes (moderate certainty, trivial effect). N95/P2 respirators may be more effective than surgical masks for ILI (low certainty, moderate effect). Hand hygiene probably modestly reduces respiratory illness burden (moderate certainty, small important effect), though not significant for ILI or lab-confirmed influenza.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**The evidence presented is up-to-date, reflecting the most recent data available at the time of analysis.**"
