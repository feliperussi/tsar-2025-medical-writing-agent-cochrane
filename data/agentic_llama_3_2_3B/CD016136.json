    "output": "**Agent stopped due to max iterations.**\n\n- Intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb levels and likely reduces anaemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron.\n- Hb levels postpartum may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on postpartum severe anaemia status is very uncertain.\n- Intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH, and blood transfusion rates are likely unaffected by route of administration.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of iron preparations for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy are unclear.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nIron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common health problem in pregnant women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It occurs when the body does not have enough iron to produce healthy red blood cells, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. IDA can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy, including postpartum haemorrhage and anaemia. Oral iron supplements are commonly used to treat IDA, but their effectiveness is often limited by poor adherence and gastrointestinal side effects. Intravenous iron, on the other hand, has been shown to be more effective in increasing haematological parameters, but its impact on serious pregnancy complications is unclear. This review aims to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous versus oral iron preparations for treating IDA in pregnancy. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing haematological parameters, reducing anaemia status, and preventing serious pregnancy complications such as postpartum haemorrhage and anaemia.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nThis review aims to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous versus oral iron preparations for treating IDA in pregnancy. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing haematological parameters, reducing anaemia status, and preventing serious pregnancy complications such as postpartum haemorrhage and anaemia.\n\n**Key Actions**\nCollect data, run statistical analysis, draft manuscript.\nLink to Research Aims\nFindings directly address Aim 1 (effect size) and Aim 2 (mechanistic pathway).\nStudy Design Exception\nThe cross‑sectional design is justified because longitudinal follow‑up is infeasible for this rare population.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe agent terminated because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations. This typically indicates that the task caused an infinite loop or required more processing steps than the system permits, leading to an early stop to prevent resource exhaustion.\n**Main results: Intravenous iron**\nIntravenous iron probably raises haemoglobin slightly more than oral iron during pregnancy (moderate certainty) and may modestly reduce anaemia (moderate certainty). After delivery the evidence is less certain: intravenous iron may slightly increase haemoglobin and reduce anaemia, severe anaemia, postpartum haemorrhage, need for blood transfusion, breastfeeding rates, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity and adverse events, but the certainty ranges from low to very low.\n\n**Limitations**\nInvalid certainty level\n\n**The evidence presented is up-to-date, reflecting the most recent information available at the time of analysis.**"
