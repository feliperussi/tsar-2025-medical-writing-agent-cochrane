    "output": "Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes\n\nPeople with CKD and diabetes often have poor adherence to their treatment regimens, which can lead to complications and reduced quality of life. Education programmes can help improve adherence by providing intensive education and behavioural counselling.\n\nWhat do people with CKD and diabetes need to know?\n\nTo manage their condition effectively, people with CKD and diabetes need to know about their disease, medication schedules, dietary recommendations, blood glucose monitoring, and kidney function monitoring.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe evaluated the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. Our results show that education programmes probably lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with CKD and diabetes (large effect, moderate certainty).\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nEducation programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear.\n\nLimitations\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nWhat are the implications of this review?\n\nMore randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nLimitations of the
