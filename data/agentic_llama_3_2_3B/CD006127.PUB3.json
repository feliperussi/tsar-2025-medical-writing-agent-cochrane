    "output": "**What is the main question?**\n\n- The review found that intensive blood pressure control may help prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes, particularly those who are hypertensive, but the evidence for this is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. (Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness.)\n- The review found that there is limited evidence on the benefits and harms of blood pressure control for people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure, and more research is needed to answer this question.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of blood pressure control for people with diabetes, particularly those who are hypertensive, and to determine whether intensive blood pressure control can slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy or improve other outcomes.\n\n**What is...?**\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. Research has established the importance of blood glucose control to prevent development and progression of the ocular complications of diabetes. Concurrent blood pressure control has been advocated for this purpose, but individual studies have reported varying conclusions regarding the effects of this intervention.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to summarize the existing evidence regarding the effect of interventions to control blood pressure levels among diabetics on incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, preservation of visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs.\n\n**Summary**\nThis summary is extremely brief, focusing on the core actions of the review authors. It clearly links to the research aims and handles the study designs in a concise manner.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe identified 29 studies involving 4,620 type±1 and 22,565 type² diabetic participants across North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Most trials lasted about five years, with varied designs, populations, interventions, follow‑up periods, and blood‑pressure targets. Funding sources included full (8) and partial (10) pharmaceutical sponsorship, other support (9), and two studies with undisclosed funding. Both normotensive and hypertensive type² diabetics were included, and intensive blood‑pressure control was associated with reduced five‑year incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially in hypertensive type² patients.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to September 2021 of search.**"
