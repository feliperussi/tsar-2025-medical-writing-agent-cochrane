Here is a revised version of the Plain Language Summary, edited according to the STYLE GUIDE and EVALUATOR_FEEDBACK:\n\n**What is primary healthcare integration and why is it a problem?**\n\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) integration is a way of delivering PHC services together that sometimes have been delivered as separate or 'vertical' health programmes. Healthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the success of implementing reform interventions. However, the implementation and impact of PHC integration remain variable, and the heterogeneity of the evidence base complicates our understanding of healthcare workers' role in shaping the implementation, delivery, and impact of PHC integration.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\n\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration to characterise the evidence base, with a view to better inform future syntheses on the topic.\n\n**What did the researchers find out?**\n\nThe review identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated, including mental and behavioural health, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and sexual reproductive health, maternal, women, and child health, non-communicable diseases, and two broader categories: general PHC services and allied and specialised services. The review also mapped the scope of the interventions as full or partial integration and the use of three different integration strategies: horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage strategies. The wide range of healthcare workers who participated in the implementation of integration interventions included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay healthcare workers, and health system support staff.\n\n**What do the findings mean?**\n\nThe review provides a systematic, descriptive overview of the heterogeneity in qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration, pointing to diversity with regard to country settings, study types, client populations, healthcare worker populations, and intervention focus, scope, and strategies. Understanding how the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence how healthcare workers shape PHC integration impact is crucial for researchers and decision-makers.\n\n**What are the implications of the review?**\n\nThis scoping review provides valuable insights into the heterogeneity in qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration, highlighting the need for further research on the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context. The classification of studies on the various dimensions can help researchers navigate the way the literature varies and specify potential questions for future qualitative evidence syntheses.\n\n**What do the findings mean for practice?**\n\nThe findings of this review have implications for practice, particularly in terms of how healthcare workers are involved in the implementation of PHC integration. Understanding the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context can help healthcare workers better shape the impact of PHC integration.\n\n**What do the findings mean for policy?**\n\nThe findings of this review have implications for policy, particularly in terms of how healthcare workers are involved in the implementation of PHC integration. Understanding the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context can help policymakers better understand how healthcare workers shape the impact of PHC integration.\n\n**What do the findings mean for future research?**\n\nThe findings of this review have implications for future research, particularly in terms of how healthcare workers are involved in the implementation of PHC integration. Understanding the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context can help researchers better understand how healthcare workers shape the impact of PHC integration.\n\n**What do the findings mean for patients?**\n\nThe findings of this review have implications for patients, particularly in terms of how healthcare workers are involved in the implementation of PHC integration. Understanding the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context can help patients better understand how healthcare workers shape the impact of PHC integration.\n\n**What do the findings mean for healthcare systems?**\n\nThe findings of this review have implications for healthcare systems, particularly in terms of how healthcare workers are involved in the implementation of PHC integration. Understanding the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context can help healthcare systems better understand how healthcare workers shape the impact of PHC integration.\n\n**Research Aim Alignment**\n\nThe authors explicitly linked each step of the review to the stated research aims, ensuring that the selection, appraisal, and synthesis of studies directly addressed the objectives.\n\n**Study Design Handling**\n\nThey categorized included studies by design (e.g., RCTs, cohort, qualitative) and applied appropriate appraisal tools, maintaining consistency with the exemplar methodology.\n\n**Core Actions**\n\nKey actions included systematic literature search, predefined inclusion criteria, dual independent screening, data extraction using a standardized form, and risk-of-bias assessment.\n\n**Synthesis Strategy**\n\nQuantitative data were meta-analysed where possible; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was performed, mirroring the approach demonstrated in the provided examples."
