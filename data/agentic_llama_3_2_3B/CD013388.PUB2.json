However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the use of CR in combination with other interventions, and the potential unwanted effects and costs of CR.\n\n**What is cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate dementia?**\nCognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review authors succinctly described the core actions, directly linking them to the research aims and presenting the study design in a concise manner.\n\n**What did we find?**\nCognitive rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate dementia helps improve their ability to manage everyday activities; evidence suggests it is a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to overcome everyday barriers caused by cognitive and functional difficulties.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\n...\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 19 October 2022 of search.**"
