    "output": "I can help you with that. Here is the revised Plain Language Summary:\n\nIs using a video camera to see a baby's vocal cords better than the traditional method for placing breathing tubes in newborns?\n\nWhat are the main take-away messages?\n- Using a video camera to see a baby's vocal cords may increase the chance of successful intubation on the first attempt. It may also reduce the number of attempts needed. However, it does not appear to shorten the time required for a successful intubation (low-certainty evidence).\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy in neonatal intubation.\n\nWhat is the health problem?\nEstablishing a secure airway is a critical part of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room and the neonatal intensive care unit. Neonates who have difficulty establishing a secure airway are at risk of desaturation, bradycardia, and other complications. Current methods for establishing a secure airway, such as direct laryngoscopy and bag-valve-mask ventilation, can be associated with adverse effects like airway trauma and desaturation.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe researchers aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in neonates (0 to 28 days of age). Specifically, they wanted to determine whether videolaryngoscopy can reduce the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation, increase the success rate of intubation on the first attempt, and minimize adverse effects like desaturation and airway trauma.\n\nHow was the review conducted?\nThe review aimed to assess the effectiveness of videolaryngoscopy on neonatal intubation outcomes. The authors performed a systematic literature search, screened studies against inclusion criteria, and extracted and synthesized data using meta-analysis. All included studies were randomized controlled trials, and the review followed PRISMA guidelines.\n\nWhat did we find?\nVideolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in neonates may increase first-attempt success and reduce the number of attempts, is unlikely to shorten the time required for successful intubation, and likely lowers the incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew their treatment and the studies were small. There were no data available on other adverse effects of videolaryngoscopy. We found a high risk of bias in areas of allocation concealment and performance bias in the included studies.\n\nIs the evidence current?\nThe evidence is current up to November 2022.\n\nWhat are the implications of the findings?\nVideolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (low-certainty evidence). Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy in neonatal intubation.\n\nThis review found that videolaryngoscopy may be more effective and potentially reduce harm when compared to direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in neonates. However, the evidence is currently low-certainty, and more research is needed to confirm these findings. Well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy in neonatal intubation."
