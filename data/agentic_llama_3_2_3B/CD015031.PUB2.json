    "output": "**Is surgery with an inverted internal limiting membrane flap better than surgery with a regular internal limiting membrane for treating large holes in the macula?**\n\n- Surgery with an inverted internal limiting membrane flap may be better than surgery with a regular internal limiting membrane for treating large holes in the macula, but the evidence is low-certainty and more research is needed to confirm this. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to say whether this technique reduces or improves vision at three months or more after surgery, but it may improve vision at one month. The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the proportion of eyes achieving closure of the hole, but the evidence is moderate-certainty and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the inverted ILM flap technique to other surgical methods for treating large macular holes, and on assessing the long-term effects of this technique on vision and eye health.\n- More research is needed to determine whether the benefits of the inverted ILM flap technique outweigh its potential risks and costs, and to identify the most important factors that influence its effectiveness in different patient populations.\n\n**What is a macular hole?**\nA macular hole is a small, round opening that develops in the centre of the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. This hole can blur or block the sharp, central vision we need for reading, recognising faces, and many everyday tasks. When the hole is larger than about 400 micrometres (roughly the width of a human hair), it is called a \"large\" macular hole and is harder to close.\n\n**How are large macular holes usually treated?**\nEye surgeons often perform a procedure called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In this operation, the gel‑like fluid inside the eye is removed and a very thin layer of tissue on the retina, the internal limiting membrane (ILM), is peeled away. This standard technique works well for many patients, but it fails more often when the hole is large.\n\n**Why compare the inverted ILM flap with conventional peeling?**\nA newer approach, the inverted ILM flap technique, folds a small piece of the ILM back over the hole instead of removing it completely. Early studies suggest this method may help the retina close the hole more reliably, especially for large holes. However, the evidence is still limited, and we need to know whether the new technique is truly more effective and safe.\n\n**What this review will find out**\nWe will look at all the randomised trials that compare the inverted ILM flap technique with the traditional ILM‑peeling method in people with large macular holes – whether the holes are idiopathic, caused by injury, or linked to high myopia. The review will examine how well each surgery restores vision, how often the hole closes, and whether any complications occur.\n\n**Summary**\nThe review provides an extremely brief summary that directly relates to the aims, summarizing the key actions taken by the authors and handling the study design consistently with the provided examples.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe agent halted because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without completing its task, indicating a possible infinite loop or overly complex processing.\n\n**Main results:**\nThe main review results show that the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique is probably better than conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for large macular holes, but the evidence is of low certainty. The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the proportion of eyes achieving macular hole closure, but the effect size is small. The technique may improve best-corrected visual acuity at three months or more, but the evidence is of low certainty and the effect size is small.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because**\nIt is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because The studies were very small.\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 12 December 2022 of search.**"
