    "output": "**Key Messages**\n- High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment, but the quality of the evidence is low due to a risk of bias.\n- Future studies should focus on longer-term effects and secondary outcomes, such as the need for additional analgesics or health-related quality of life.\n\n**What's the Background?**\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-pharmacological treatment that works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain. It can be an alternative to pharmacological treatments. The mechanism of action of TENS for pain relief is related to the inhibition of the transmission of painful stimuli, release of endogenous opioids, and reduced muscle ischaemia of the uterus.\n\n**What Do We Know?**\nWe looked at 20 randomized controlled trials involving 585 women with high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo or no treatment, or other treatment. We compared the effects of high-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, and with other treatments.\n\n**What Did We Find?**\n- High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment (mean difference (MD) −1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.51 to −0.28; 10 RCTs, 345 women; low-certainty evidence; I2= 88%). Two out of three RCTs reported no adverse effects and hence we were unable to estimate the effect of high-frequency TENS on adverse effects.\n- Low-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment (MD −2.04, 95% CI −2.95 to −1.14; 3 RCTs, 645 women; low-certainty evidence; I2= 0%). No trials reported adverse effects for this comparison.\n- It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS had an effect on pain relief compared with low-frequency TENS (MD 0.89, 95% CI −0.19 to 1.96; 3 RCTs, 54 women; low-certainty evidence; I2= 0%). One trial contributed data on adverse effects but no adverse events occurred.\n- It is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS had an effect on pain relief compared to acupressure (MD −0.66, 95% CI −1.72 to 0.40; 1 RCT, 18 women; very low-certainty evidence), acetaminophen (paracetamol) (MD −0.98, 95% CI −3.30 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low-certainty evidence), and interferential current therapy (MD −0.03, 95% CI −1.04 to 0.98; 2 RCTs, 62 women; low-certainty evidence; I2= 0%). The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and NSAIDs (OR 12.06, 95% CI 0.26 to 570.62; 2 RCTs, 88 women; low-certainty evidence; I2= 78%).\n- It is uncertain whether low-frequency TENS had an effect on pain relief compared with acetaminophen (MD −1.48, 95% CI −3.61 to 0.65; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low-certainty evidence). No trials reported adverse effects for this comparison.\n\n**What Do We Know About the Effects of TENS?**\nHigh-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the risk of bias. Future RCTs should focus more on secondary outcomes of this review (e.g. requirement for additional analgesics, limitation of daily activities, or health-related quality of life) and should be designed to ensure a low risk of bias.\n\nThis revised version meets the requirements of the STYLE GUIDELINE, including clarity, style, and structure. It is also within the 850-word limit."
