    "output": "**What is the health problem?**\n\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a common fertility treatment that can increase the chances of pregnancy. However, women who undergo FET may be unsure about which cycle regimen is best for them. This is because FET is performed using different cycle regimens: spontaneous ovulatory (natural) cycles; cycles in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by oestrogen and progesterone hormones, commonly known as hormone therapy (HT) FET cycles; and cycles in which ovulation is induced by drugs (ovulation induction FET cycles). HT can be used with or without a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa).\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\n\nThe researchers wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of natural cycle FET, HT cycle FET, and ovulation induction cycle FET, and compare subtypes of these regimens.\n\n**Aims**\n\nThe review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different FET cycle types on pregnancy rates.\n\n**Core Actions**\n\nAuthors systematically searched databases, screened studies, extracted data, and performed meta-analysis.\n\n**Study Design**\n\nOnly randomized controlled trials meeting predefined criteria were included, adhering to critical appraisal rules.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe main review results show that natural cycle FET is probably as effective as HT FET in terms of live birth rates, but may have a slightly higher risk of multiple pregnancies. The use of GnRHa suppression in HT FET cycles may reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies, but the evidence is uncertain. The review also found that HT FET may have a slightly lower risk of miscarriage than modified natural cycle FET, but the evidence is very low-certainty.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited by a small number of trials, short follow-up periods, and variability in study quality, which reduces confidence in the effect estimates. Many studies had unclear risk of bias, and the participant populations were often narrow, limiting generalisability to broader patient groups. Additionally, inconsistent reporting of outcomes and potential publication bias further weaken the strength of the conclusions presented in the Cochrane Plain Language Summary.\n\n**The evidence is current as of the latest available data up to October 2025.**\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- The review found that the effectiveness of different frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle types in achieving pregnancy rates is unclear due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- The certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low, and the confidence intervals were wide, making it difficult to determine whether one cycle regimen is more effective and safer than another.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as the use of foam or air‑filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body, and the unwanted effects and costs associated with different cycle regimens."
