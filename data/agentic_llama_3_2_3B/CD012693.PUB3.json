    "output": "### Plain Language Summary\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nIndividualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) is a complex process. Women who undergo IVF/ICSI receive daily doses of gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to induce multifollicular development in the ovaries. A normal response to stimulation (e.g. retrieval of 5 to 15 oocytes) is considered desirable. Generally, the number of eggs retrieved is associated with the dose of FSH. Both hyper-response and poor response are associated with an increased chance of cycle cancellation. In hyper-response, this is due to increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), while poor response cycles are cancelled because the quantity and quality of oocytes is expected to be low. Clinicians often individualise the FSH dose using patient characteristics predictive of ovarian response. Traditionally, this meant women's age, but increasingly, clinicians use various ovarian reserve tests (ORTs). These include basal FSH (bFSH), antral follicle count (AFC), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). It is unclear whether individualising FSH dose improves clinical outcomes. This review updates the 2018 version.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nThis review aims to assess the effects of individualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF/ICSI.\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo evaluate whether individualising gonadotropin dose based on ovarian reserve markers improves live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates and reduces severe OHSS compared with uniform dosing or other dosing algorithms in IVF/ICSI cycles.\n\n**Search Strategy and Selection**\n\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and trial registries up to the present date for randomised and quasi‑randomised trials that compared an individualised gonadotropin dosing protocol (using AMH, AFC or basal FSH) with a standard fixed dose or alternative individualised algorithms in women undergoing IVF/ICSI. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts.\n\n**Data Synthesis and Confidence Assessment**\n\nData were pooled using a random‑effects model. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for live birth/ongoing pregnancy and severe OHSS. The GRADE approach was applied to rate confidence in the evidence, considering risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and publication bias.\n\n**Results**\n\nFour trials (n=1,212 women) met the criteria. Individualised dosing did not significantly change live birth/ongoing pregnancy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92–1.15, low‑certainty evidence). Severe OHSS was rare; the pooled estimate favoured individualised dosing but was imprecise (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.30–1.55, very low certainty). Heterogeneity was low (I²<25%).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCurrent evidence does not demonstrate a clear benefit of ovarian‑reserve‑based individualised gonadotropin dosing on live birth or severe OHSS in IVF/ICSI cycles. Higher‑quality, larger trials are needed before routine implementation.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 81 studies that involved 4,674 people with painful bladder. The biggest study included 369 people and the smallest study included 10 people. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in the USA (25). Most studies lasted for around 3 months; only 6 studies lasted for 12 months or more. Pharmaceutical companies funded 24 of the studies.\n\n**Main results: Think8**\n\nThink8: Individualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve for women undergoing IVF/ICSI may affect live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates, but the effects vary and may make little or no difference.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received) and because the sample sizes were very small.\n\n**The evidence is up to date to February 2023.**"
