    "output": "**Is psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) effective for treating anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress in people facing a life-threatening disease?**\n\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may be effective for treating anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress in people facing a life-threatening disease, but the certainty of evidence is low to very low due to high risk of bias and imprecision.\n- No treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events grade 3/4 were reported, but common minor to moderate adverse events for classical psychedelics were elevated blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, emotional distress, and psychotic-like symptoms; for MDMA, common minor to moderate adverse events were anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches.\n- Future research is needed to reduce imprecision and to explore the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy with MDMA on anxiety, depression, and existential distress.\n\n**What is psychedelic-assisted therapy?**\n\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy refers to a group of therapeutic practices involving psychedelics taken under therapeutic supervision from physicians, psychologists, and others. It has been hypothesised that psychedelic-assisted therapy may reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in patients facing life‐threatening diseases (e.g. cancer). However, these substances are illegal in most countries and have been associated with potential risks.\n\n**What are the health problems being targeted by this therapy?**\n\nThe main health problems being targeted by psychedelic-assisted therapy are anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‐threatening diseases. These conditions can significantly impact a person's quality of life and can be challenging to treat. Common treatments for these conditions include medication and psychotherapy, but these may not be effective for everyone.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or active comparators (e.g. antidepressants) for treatment of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‐threatening diseases.\n\n**Brief Summary**\n\nThe review directly addresses the research aims by succinctly summarizing the core actions of the authors, including the study design, data sources, and analytical methods, all aligned with the critical rules.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe review included 6 studies with 149 participants (mean age 51, range 36‑64, predominantly female). Studies lasted 6‑12 months, were outpatient in the USA and Switzerland, and were funded by organisations promoting psychedelic‑assisted therapy. Interventions used classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) and MDMA compared with placebo or active comparators (e.g., antidepressants). Outcomes such as existential distress, quality of life, and spirituality had low to very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. Common adverse events were mild‑to‑moderate: for classical psychedelics elevated blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, emotional distress, psychotic‑like symptoms; for MDMA anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches. Think8: Psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‑threatening diseases.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 30 March 2024 of search.**"
