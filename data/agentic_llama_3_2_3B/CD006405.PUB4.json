    "output": "**Is nasal high-flow therapy better or worse than other breathing support methods for preterm babies?**\n\n- Nasal high-flow therapy may result in little to no difference in death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) compared to other breathing support methods for preterm babies, but may increase treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry.\n- Nasal high-flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and likely a reduction in pneumothorax compared to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).\n- More research is needed to determine the effects of nasal high-flow therapy on extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation.\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy?**\n\nNasal high flow (nHF) therapy provides heated, humidified air and oxygen via two small nasal prongs, at gas flows of more than 1 litre/minute (L/min), typically 2 L/min to 8 L/min. It is commonly used for non-invasive respiratory support in preterm neonates. nHF may be used in this population for primary respiratory support (avoiding, or prior to the use of mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube) for prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).\n\n**What is the problem with nasal high flow therapy?**\n\nRespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common condition in preterm infants, which can lead to serious complications and even death. nHF therapy is used to support preterm infants with RDS, but there is ongoing debate about its effectiveness compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of nHF for primary respiratory support in preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention X, systematically searched relevant databases, screened studies against predefined criteria, extracted data, and performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Findings were synthesized to address the research question and inform practice.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nNasal high flow therapy for primary respiratory support in preterm infants was studied in 13 trials involving 2,540 infants. The trials lasted for varying durations, but most were less than 72 hours. The studies were conducted in multiple countries, with no specific country dominating the results. The trials compared nasal high flow therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The population studied consisted of preterm infants born before 37 weeks of gestation. The studies found that nasal high flow therapy may result in little to no difference in death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to CPAP or NIPPV. However, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry. Nasal high flow therapy was also found to reduce the risk of pneumothorax and nasal trauma compared to CPAP. The evidence for the use of nasal high flow therapy in extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks of gestation is lacking. No studies were found to compare nasal high flow therapy with ambient oxygen or low-flow nasal cannulae.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes, lack of longitudinal data, potential selection bias, and reliance on self-reported measures, which together constrain the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\n**Evidence Currency**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
