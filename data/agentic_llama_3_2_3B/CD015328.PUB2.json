Interventions that aim to prevent obesity involve behavioural change strategies that promote healthy eating or 'activity' levels. There is uncertainty over which approaches are more effective.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compare diet or activity interventions with no intervention, usual care, or another eligible intervention in children aged 5 to 11 years. The identified results were combined, and the confidence in the evidence was assessed.\n\n**What did we find?**\nStudy name: Think8; Parameters: input=\"To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels.\"\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence presented is limited by its reliance on self-reported data, small sample sizes, and a lack of longitudinal follow-up, which together constrain the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n- To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels, or a combination of both, on changes in BMI, zBMI score and serious adverse events.\n\n**Methods Summary**\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was February 2023.\n\n**What did we find?**\nStudy name: Think8; Parameters: input=\"To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels.\"\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence presented is limited by its reliance on self-reported data, small sample sizes, and a lack of longitudinal follow-up, which together constrain the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n- To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels, or a combination of both, on changes in BMI, zBMI score and serious adverse events.\n\n**Methods Summary**\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods.
