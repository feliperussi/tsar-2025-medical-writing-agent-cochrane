    "output": "**Is individual-level stress management better than no intervention or other types of stress management for reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers?**\n\n- Individual-level stress management interventions may reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers, with effects lasting up to a year after the end of the intervention.\n- A combination of individual-level interventions may be beneficial for reducing stress symptoms in the short term, but long-term effects are unknown.\n- More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of individual-level stress management interventions, particularly in terms of their impact on work-related risk factors.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nHealthcare workers can suffer from work-related stress as a result of an imbalance of demands, skills and social support at work. This may lead to stress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration of service provision. Stress, burnout and psychosomatic problems can have serious consequences for healthcare workers and the quality of care they provide. Common treatments for work-related stress include stress management training, time management training, and employee assistance programs. However, these interventions may not be effective for all healthcare workers, and more research is needed to understand what works best.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of stress-reduction interventions targeting individual healthcare workers compared to no intervention, wait list, placebo, no stress-reduction intervention or another type of stress-reduction intervention in reducing stress symptoms. They wanted to know whether individual-level stress interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress, can reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They also wanted to know whether a combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. Additionally, they wanted to assess the long-term effects of individual-level stress management interventions on stress symptoms. The researchers also aimed to identify the best ways to give stress-reduction interventions and what aspects of stress-reduction interventions help someone to stop smoking.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nIndividual-level stress interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers were evaluated in a review of 27 studies involving 2,845 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries, including the USA, and lasted from a few months to over a year. The interventions targeted individual healthcare workers and focused on either the experience of stress, stress disengagement, work-related risk factors, or a combination of these. The review found that individual-level stress interventions may reduce stress symptoms in the short and medium term, but the long-term effects are unknown. A combination of interventions may also be beneficial in the short term. However, the evidence is generally low-certainty, and more studies are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence.\n\n**Main results: Reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers**\n\nIndividual-level stress interventions may reduce stress symptoms in the short and medium term, but the long-term effects are unknown.
