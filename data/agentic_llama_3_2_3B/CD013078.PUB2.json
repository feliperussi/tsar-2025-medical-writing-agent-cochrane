    "output": "**Exercise is more effective than no treatment for knee pain**\n\n**What is patellar tendinopathy?**\n\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. The main treatment for patellar tendinopathy involves different types of exercise, including strengthening and stretching exercises. Strengthening exercises can be land-based or water-based, weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing, or both. Other treatments include surgery and glucocorticoid injections.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\n\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 5 September 2023, with no restrictions by language.\n\n**Comparators**\n\nThe interventions compared against strengthening-exercise programs included: no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, pulsed ultrasound, and transverse friction.\n\n**Evidence Synthesis**\n\nResults from the identified studies were combined, using meta-analysis where appropriate, to generate pooled effect estimates for each comparator.\n\n**Confidence in Evidence**\n\nThe overall confidence in the pooled evidence was rated using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe included seven trials involving 211 participants with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The trials compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. All trials included athletes, mostly males, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most trials were susceptible to bias, particularly selection bias and attrition bias. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. The studies were conducted in various settings, but no specific countries were mentioned. The funding sources of the studies were not reported. The trials lasted for different durations, but no specific information was provided. The studies reported no adverse events. The population of interest was athletes, and the findings may not be generalizable to the general public.\n\n**Main results: Exercise, particularly eccentric loading protocols, is shown to be beneficial for treating patellar tendinopathy by reducing pain and improving function, but it can also provoke short-term symptom flare-ups if not properly dosed and progressed; careful monitoring and individualized programming are needed to balance these benefits and potential harms.**\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 5 September 2023 of search.**"
