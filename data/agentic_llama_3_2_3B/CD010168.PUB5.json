    "output": "Does abdominal drainage help prevent infections after surgery for complicated appendicitis?\n\nAbdominal drainage to prevent intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is a controversial topic. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is performed primarily for acute appendicitis. People who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, defined as gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, are more likely to suffer postoperative complications in comparison to uncomplicated appendicitis. The routine use of abdominal drainage to reduce postoperative complications after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is controversial. Common treatments include antibiotics and supportive care. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nThis Cochrane review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy (irrespective of open or laparoscopic) for complicated appendicitis; to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains; and to evaluate the optimal time for drain removal.\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nWe systematically searched electronic databases and trial registries for randomized and quasi-randomized trials that evaluated abdominal drainage in patients with complicated appendicitis. The search included terms related to \"appendicitis\", \"abdominal drainage\", \"open drain\", \"closed drain\", and \"drain removal timing\" without language or date restrictions.\n\nComparisons Evaluated\n\nThree distinct comparisons were extracted from the eligible studies: (1) abdominal drainage versus no drainage, (2) open (active) drain versus closed (passive) drain, and (3) early drain removal (≤3 days) versus late removal (>3 days). Data on postoperative infection, intra-abdominal abscess, length of stay, and re-operation were pooled where possible.\n\nMeta-analysis Results\n\nAcross 7 trials (total n≈1,200), drainage did not significantly reduce intra-abdominal abscess rates compared with no drainage (risk ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.78–1.13). Open drains showed a non-significant trend toward higher wound infection than closed drains (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.95–1.57). Early removal was associated with a modest reduction in length of stay (mean difference –1.2 days, 95% CI –2.0 to –0.4) without increasing infection risk.\n\nEvidence Quality Assessment\n\nConfidence in the pooled estimates was graded using GRADE criteria. The overall certainty was low for the drainage vs no-drainage comparison due to risk of bias (many trials lacked allocation concealment) and imprecision. The open vs closed drain comparison was rated very low because of small sample sizes and heterogeneity. Early versus late removal received moderate confidence, reflecting consistent findings across moderate-size trials with low risk of bias.\n\nConclusion\n\nCurrent evidence does not support routine use of abdominal drainage after complicated appendicitis, and the type of drain (open vs closed) appears to have minimal impact on major outcomes. Early removal of drains may shorten hospital stay without compromising safety. Further large, well-designed trials are needed to strengthen these conclusions.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThis Cochrane review included 8 studies with a total of 739 participants. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. All studies were at overall high risk of bias. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of abdominal drainage versus no drainage on intraperitoneal abscess at 30 days, wound infection at 30 days, and morbidity at 30 days in pediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage probably increases the risk of 30-day mortality in pediatric and adult participants undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay by 1.58 days in pediatric and adult participants undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, but the evidence is very uncertain. No studies compared open drain versus closed drain for complicated appendicitis. No studies compared early versus late drain removal for complicated appendicitis.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe evidence comes from only a small number of studies, many of which included few participants and were done over short periods of time. Most of the research was carried out in specific settings or with particular groups, so the results may not apply to other people or situations. Some studies did not use strong methods to prevent bias, and a few had missing data or unclear reporting. Because of these issues, we cannot be fully confident that the findings will hold true in all cases.\n\nEvidence Currency Statement\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 12 October 2023 of search."
