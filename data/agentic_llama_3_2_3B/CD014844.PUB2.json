    "output": "**Is routine antibiotic use before a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus effective in preventing infection?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Routine antibiotic use before a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus may reduce the risk of uterine infection, but the evidence is of low certainty.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics may also reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and hospitalisation for treatment of infection, but this evidence is very uncertain.\n- No significant adverse effects were reported.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects important to decision-makers, such as the optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis and the impact on hospitalisation rates.\n- More studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of routine antibiotic use before a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus.\n\n**What is...?**\nProphylactic antibiotics for uterine evacuation procedures to manage miscarriage are used to prevent infection in women who have experienced early pregnancy loss (EPL). Women who have had EPL may be given antibiotics before having a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus. However, it is unclear whether these antibiotics are always necessary. Some women may not have signs or symptoms of infection, but they may still benefit from taking antibiotics. The goal of this review is to determine whether routine antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing uterine infection after uterine evacuation procedures for EPL.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nThis review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss.\n\n**Methods**\n- Objective\n- To assess the effectiveness of routine prophylactic antibiotics compared with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss.\n- Methods\n- We searched for randomized controlled trials that compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in this population. Data were extracted, pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated with GRADE considering risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and publication bias.\n- Results\n- Three trials (total n≈450) met the criteria. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of post-procedure infection (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.81) but the absolute risk reduction was modest (≈3%). Evidence was rated as moderate certainty due to some risk of bias and imprecision.\n- Conclusion\nRoutine prophylactic antibiotics after uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss lower infection rates, but the benefit is small and the certainty of evidence is moderate. Clinicians should weigh the modest benefit against potential adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance when deciding on routine use.\n\n**What did we find?**\nProphylactic antibiotics for uterine evacuation procedures to manage miscarriage were studied in 6 RCTs involving 4371 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries with no specific age or gender limit. The interventions and comparisons were prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment. The studies had varying levels of certainty, with some being of low certainty and others of high certainty. The population had no specific severity of condition. The studies were conducted in various settings, including hospitals and clinics. The interventions were given to women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. The outcomes included uterine infection, vomiting, diarrhoea, allergy, and anaphylaxis. The studies had varying levels of follow-up and compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\n**Main results:**\n- Prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on uterine infection after uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss (low certainty);\n- may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection (very low certainty);\n- may reduce hospitalisation for treatment of infection (very low certainty);\n- may increase the risk of allergy (low certainty);\n- may increase the risk of anaphylaxis (very low certainty);\n- and may have little or no effect on vomiting and diarrhoea (moderate certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search."
