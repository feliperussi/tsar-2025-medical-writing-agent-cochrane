    "output": "Is physical exercise better than no exercise for people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that affects the veins in the legs and can cause swelling and pain)?\n\nDue to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of physical exercise in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency are unclear. We need more research to understand the effects of physical exercise on people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)?\n\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair quality of life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful to reduce CVI symptoms.\n\nWhat are the aims of this review?\n\nThis review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThis review included 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 146 participants, all investigating physical exercise programmes versus no structured exercise in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The trials were conducted in unspecified countries and settings, lasted six months, and did not report participant ages, disease severity, or funding sources. No data were available on outcomes such as incidence of venous leg ulcers, surgical interventions, quality of life, ankle joint mobility, plantar flexion, muscle strength, exercise capacity, venous refilling time, ejection fraction, venous clinical severity score, disease sign intensity, or health-related quality of life.\n\nMain results: Physical exercise probably makes little to no difference to disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, ankle mobility, and may make little to no difference to muscle strength and plantar flexion in the short term.\n\nDespite the breadth of data collected, the evidence is limited by its reliance on self-reported measures, a relatively short follow-up period, and a sample that may not be representative of the broader population, which together constrain the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 28 March 2022 of search."
