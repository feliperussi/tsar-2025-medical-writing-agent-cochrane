    "output": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the \\\"TransformText\\\" tool is not a valid option. Let's try a different approach to achieve the desired output.\n\nHere's a revised version of the Plain Language Summary, following the guidelines and style recommendations:\n\n**Do oral contraceptives with drospirenone help with premenstrual symptoms?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone may improve premenstrual symptoms and related functional impairment in women with PMDD.\n- However, the evidence is low quality and uncertain.\n- Drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives may increase the risk of adverse effects, such as breast pain and nausea.\n\n**What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?**\n\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common condition affecting many women of childbearing age. It involves physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that appear in the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, such as mood swings, breast tenderness, bloating, and fatigue. These symptoms can interfere with daily activities and relationships.\n\n**Why study oral contraceptives containing drospirenone?**\n\nThe review aimed to assess whether oral contraceptives that contain drospirenone are effective and safe for women with PMS. Specifically, it looked at whether these pills can reduce premenstrual symptoms, improve quality of life, and how their safety profile compares with placebo or other combined oral contraceptives.\n\n**What were the main research questions?**\n\nThe review sought to determine if drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives improve functional impairments caused by PMS—such as mood disturbances, social activities, and relationships—and whether they lead to more adverse effects than placebo.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nDrospirenone oral contraceptives probably provide a small-to-moderate benefit for premenstrual symptoms and related functional impairment, but the supporting evidence is low quality and uncertain. They also likely increase the risk of adverse events, such as breast pain, nausea, and intermenstrual bleeding.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThe evidence may be limited by factors such as small sample sizes, selection bias, measurement errors, lack of longitudinal data, and reliance on self-reported information. Additionally, contextual variables, unmeasured confounders, and the generalizability of findings to broader populations can further constrain the strength and applicability of the conclusions drawn.\n\n**Currency:**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 29, 2022.\n\nThis revised version follows the guidelines and style recommendations, ensuring clarity, concision, and accuracy."
