    "output": "Do self-management programs for people with visual impairment really improve their quality of life?\n\nWe aimed to assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions. We found low-certainty evidence that multifaceted self-management interventions have little or no effects on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment. Research is needed to develop more sensitive measures of quality of life and to assess the benefit of such interventions across a broader demographic, including different stages of vision impairment and people with dual-sensory impairment."
