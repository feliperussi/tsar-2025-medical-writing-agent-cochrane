    "output": "**Plain Language Summary**\n\n**What is IgA Nephropathy?**\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common primary glomerular disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage to the kidney tissue. If left untreated, IgAN can progress to kidney failure, which can have severe consequences for the patient's quality of life.\n\n**What is Non-immunosuppressive Treatment?**\nNon-immunosuppressive treatment is a type of treatment that does not involve the use of immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide. Instead, it focuses on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression through lifestyle changes, medications, and other interventions.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nThe review aims to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for IgAN in adults and children. Specifically, we want to examine the effectiveness of various non-immunosuppressive therapies, such as antihypertensives, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines, in managing IgAN symptoms and preventing disease progression.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe review included 80 studies that involved 4856 participants with IgA nephropathy. The studies were conducted in Japan. The studies lasted for varying durations, with most being under 25 years. No information is available on the funding sources of the studies. The studies examined the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments such as antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines on IgA nephropathy. The studies focused on outcomes such as proteinuria, kidney failure, doubling of serum creatinine, remission of haematuria, relapse of proteinuria, and death. The population studied included adults and children with biopsy-proven IgAN. No information is available on the study settings outside of Japan. The studies were mostly of low to moderate quality, with high or unclear risk of bias in many of the assessed methodological domains. The results of the studies were expressed as mean differences and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals using random-effects meta-analysis. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\n\n**Main results: Non-immunosuppressive treatment probably reduces the risk of kidney failure (large effect, high certainty) and probably reduces proteinuria (moderate effect, moderate certainty). It may slightly reduce the risk of kidney failure (small, important, moderate certainty) and may make little to no difference to kidney function (trivial, low certainty). Tonsillectomy probably increases remission of proteinuria (large effect, low certainty) and remission of microscopic haematuria (moderate effect, low certainty). It may slightly reduce the risk of relapse of proteinuria (small, important, low certainty) and may make little to no difference to the risk of relapse of haematuria (trivial, low certainty).**\n\n**Limitations**\nWhile the available studies provide valuable insights, they are limited by small sample sizes, short follow‑up periods, and a reliance on self‑reported outcomes, which may introduce bias and reduce the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**evidence_currency_statement:** The evidence is up to date to December 2023 of search."
