    "output": "Adding ultrasound to routine mammograms does not improve breast cancer detection in average-risk women. High certainty evidence shows that screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography detects more breast cancer than mammography alone, but the number of false-positive results and necessary biopsies is higher. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected three more cancer cases per 1000 women screened than mammography alone. However, the number of false-positive results and biopsy rates were higher in women receiving additional ultrasonography for breast cancer screening. None of the included studies analysed whether the higher number of screen-detected cancers in the intervention group resulted in a lower mortality rate compared to mammography alone. Randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies with a longer observation period are needed to assess the effects of the two screening interventions on morbidity and mortality."
