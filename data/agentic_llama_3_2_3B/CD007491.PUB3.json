    "output": "**Is admission of older people to hospital at home (active care in their own home) better than hospital care for those who are mostly older and have acute medical conditions?**\n\n**Key Messages:**\n- Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference on mortality at six months' follow-up for older people with acute medical conditions (risk ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.13; P = 0.30; I2= 0%; 5 trials, 1502 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference on the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital after discharge from hospital at home or inpatient care within 3 to 12 months' follow-up (risk ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.34; P = 0.11; I2= 41%; 8 trials, 1757 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Admission avoidance hospital at home probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care at six months' follow-up (risk ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.69; P < 0.001; I2= 67%; 4 trials, 1271 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Hospital at home probably results in little to no difference in patient's self-reported health status (2006 patients; moderate-certainty evidence).\n- Satisfaction with health care received may be improved with admission avoidance hospital at home (1812 participants; low-certainty evidence).\n- Hospital at home reduced the initial average hospital length of stay (2036 participants; low-certainty evidence), which ranged from 4.1 to 18.5 days in the hospital group and 1.2 to 5.1 days in the hospital at home group.\n- Admission avoidance hospital at home probably reduces costs to the health service compared with hospital admission (2148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), though by a range of different amounts and using different methods to cost resource use, and there is some evidence that it decreases overall societal costs to six months' follow-up.\n- Admission avoidance hospital at home, with the option of transfer to hospital, may provide an effective alternative to inpatient care for a select group of older people who have been referred for hospital admission.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: the impact of admission avoidance hospital at home on patient outcomes for those with different types of acute medical conditions; the effects of admission avoidance hospital at home on caregiver burden and support; and the long-term effects of admission avoidance hospital at home on patient health outcomes and healthcare costs.\n\n**Introduction/Aims:**\n**Background**\nAdmission‑avoidance Hospital at Home is a model of care where health‑care professionals deliver active treatment in a patient’s own home instead of admitting them to an acute hospital. It is used for conditions that can be safely managed outside the hospital but still need professional monitoring and support. By treating patients at home, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary hospital stays, which can be costly and stressful. However, many patients are still sent to hospital because clinicians may lack clear information about which conditions are suitable for home‑based care, leading to avoidable admissions.\n**Aims**\nThe purpose of this review is to evaluate whether Admission‑avoidance Hospital at Home is effective and affordable compared with traditional inpatient care. Specifically, we will examine if this model improves clinical outcomes, lowers health‑care costs, and increases patient satisfaction when patients receive treatment at home instead of in the hospital.\n\n**Methods:**\n**Search Strategy**\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared admission avoidance hospital‑at‑home with acute hospital inpatient care.\n**Evidence Synthesis**\nThe results from the identified studies were combined, and the confidence in the overall evidence was rated using appropriate assessment criteria.\n\n**Results:**\n**What did we find?**\nThink8: Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to patient health outcomes; may improve satisfaction; probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care; and probably decreases costs.\n**Main results:**\nThink8: Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference to patient health outcomes; may improve satisfaction; probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care; and probably decreases costs.\n\n**Limitations:**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency:**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search."
