Sealants are products that can be applied to help stop this bleeding, but it's not clear how well they work in patients undergoing these procedures.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe aimed to assess whether using sealants as an additional measure during vascular surgery reduces bleeding and improves outcomes, and to identify any potential harms associated with their use.\n\n**Search Strategy**\nWe performed a systematic...
