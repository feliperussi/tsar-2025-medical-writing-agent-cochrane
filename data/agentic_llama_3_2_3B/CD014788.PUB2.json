    "output": "**Is GnRH analogues (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues) effective and safe for treating endometriosis pain and bone mineral density in women?**\n\n- GnRH analogues may be slightly effective in reducing overall pain in women with endometriosis, but the evidence is very low to low quality due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. There may be a slight decrease in bone mineral density when women are treated with GnRHas, compared to gestrinone. However, the review found no studies that compared GnRHas to other treatments, and the evidence for the benefits and harms of GnRHas is limited.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the effects of GnRHas on bone mineral density and the potential harms of long-term treatment.\n- Due to the limited and low-quality evidence, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.\n\n**The Review Aims to Assess the Effectiveness of GnRH Analogues on Endometriosis Pain and Bone Mineral Density**\n\n**Aim**\nThe review aimed to assess the effectiveness of GnRH analogues on endometriosis pain and bone mineral density.\n\n**Methods**\nAuthors performed a systematic search of databases, screened studies, and extracted data from randomized controlled trials.\n\n**Findings**\nThe synthesis indicated a modest benefit of GnRH analogues, with consistent results across studies.\n\n**What Did We Find?**\nGnRHas probably makes a slight difference in reducing pain for women with endometriosis, but may slightly decrease bone mineral density and increase hot flushes. All effects are small but important, and the certainty of the evidence is low.\n\n**Limitations of the Evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**The Evidence is Up to Date to May 2022 of Search**"
