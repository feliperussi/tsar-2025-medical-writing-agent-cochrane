    "output": "Are antibiotics before surgery helpful in preventing infection after a miscarriage?\n\nWe looked at whether giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (a surgery to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus) can help prevent infection. \n\n- Overall, the evidence was uncertain about whether giving antibiotics before surgery prevents infection. However, when we looked only at the highest-quality studies, the evidence was clearer, showing that antibiotics reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%.\n- Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n- We are uncertain about side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, or allergic reactions from these antibiotics because the evidence was limited.\n\nWhat is a miscarriage? \nA miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. To manage this, a procedure may be needed to remove any pregnancy tissue left in the womb (uterus), sometimes called a uterine evacuation. While it's clear that women with signs of infection need antibiotics, it's less clear whether those without signs of infection need antibiotics to prevent an infection from starting.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent infection reduces the risk of uterine infection and other problems for women who have this procedure after a miscarriage. We also wanted to know if antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.\n\nWhat did we do? \nWe searched for studies that compared giving antibiotics to giving a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment to women who were having this procedure after a miscarriage. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 6 studies involving 4371 women. The studies showed that antibiotics may have little or no effect on uterine infection, but the evidence is uncertain. When we looked at the three strongest studies, the evidence was clearer: giving antibiotics beforehand reduced the risk of uterine infection by 43%. The review also looked at side effects but found little to no difference in the risk of vomiting or diarrhea. The evidence about allergic reactions was very uncertain. Women who received antibiotics beforehand may have been less likely to need more antibiotics or to be admitted to the hospital for an infection, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had weaknesses, such as many participants not finishing the study. Also, in some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023."
