    "output": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- Therapy using psychedelic drugs may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough for us to be certain about this.\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and harms of this therapy. Future studies should look at its effects on quality of life and spirituality. This research must also solve the problems found in the current studies, like their small size and the difficulty in preventing people from knowing which treatment they received.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should work to reduce biases and improve the quality of evidence.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We aimed to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants' data being analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. \nThe researchers compared two types of psychedelic-assisted therapy to a placebo or other treatments. One type used classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD. The other type used MDMA, also known as 'Ecstasy'. \nPsychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. The treatment seems to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies included only a small number of people. Second, it was hard to prevent people from knowing if they were getting the real drug or a placebo, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
