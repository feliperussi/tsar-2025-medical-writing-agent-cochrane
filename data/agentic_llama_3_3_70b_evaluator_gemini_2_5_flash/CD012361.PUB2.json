    "output": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation?\nWe investigated whether dexmedetomidine can sedate and relieve pain in newborn babies who need help breathing with a machine. \n- We found no completed studies to include in our review, so we cannot say if dexmedetomidine is effective and safe for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on breathing machines.\n- We identified four ongoing studies that may provide evidence for dexmedetomidine's efficacy and safety in the future, including comparisons with other medicines like fentanyl and morphine.\n- Future studies should investigate how effective and safe dexmedetomidine is, and what its long-term effects are when used to sedate and relieve pain in newborn babies.\n\nWhy do babies on breathing machines need sedation and pain relief?\nNewborn babies who require mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe) often need sedation (to help them relax) and analgesia (pain relief) to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that works differently from opioids. It is thought to be safer because it has less effect on a baby's heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine how well dexmedetomidine works and if it is safe for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies. We also wanted to know how it compares to other medicines, like morphine, and if it has any side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebos in newborn babies on breathing machines. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that will compare dexmedetomidine with other medications, such as fentanyl and morphine, in newborn babies requiring mechanical ventilation or surgery. Because we found no studies, we cannot report on the people involved, the treatments compared, how long studies lasted, or who funded them. There is not enough information to support routinely using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on breathing machines. There is limited information on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no data on its long-term effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is that we found no completed studies to include. This means there is no evidence to answer our review question.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023."
