    "output": "Can anti-VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment before or during vitrectomy may improve outcomes for people with complications from diabetic retinopathy by reducing the risk of bleeding in the eye and improving vision.\n- Anti-VEGF treatment reduces the incidence of retinal breaks during surgery, but its effect on the need for further surgery is uncertain and needs more research.\n- Further studies are needed to fully understand the effects of anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy complications, including its potential benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Common treatments for PDR include vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel and blood from the eye, and laser photocoagulation, which uses a laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels.\n\nWhat are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how do they work?\nAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medications that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. They work by blocking a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the growth of new blood vessels. Anti-VEGF agents can be injected into the eye to reduce the amount of bleeding and scarring caused by PDR.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents in combination with vitrectomy can improve the outcomes of people with PDR. We looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications, as well as the need for further surgery.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that people who received an anti-VEGF injection in the eye along with surgery had better vision six months later than people who only had surgery. The treatment also lowered the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation. We found strong evidence that anti-VEGF treatment reduces the risk of tears in the retina (retinal breaks) during surgery. The treatment may also reduce the need for more surgery later, but this finding is uncertain and needs more research.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
