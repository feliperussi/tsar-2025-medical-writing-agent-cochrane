    "output": "Is magnetic seizure therapy a safe and effective alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for schizophrenia? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\n- Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for improving symptoms in people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- MST may cause fewer unwanted effects, such as memory problems and cognitive issues, compared to ECT, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- We need more well-designed studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of MST for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for schizophrenia?\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, for people who do not respond to antipsychotics, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used. Researchers wanted to know if a newer treatment, magnetic seizure therapy (MST), could be a safer or more effective alternative to ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MST for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to ECT or other interventions.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared MST to other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that compared MST to ECT in 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and found that MST may be as effective as ECT for improving the overall symptoms of schizophrenia. However, because of the study's limitations, the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because the only study we found was small. There were also flaws in the study's design that could have influenced the results. For example, it's possible the participants knew which treatment they were receiving. This lack of blinding, along with other issues like not all outcomes being reported and the small sample size, means we cannot be sure of the true effects of MST.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
