    "output": "Can cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities by improving their ability to perform specific tasks, with benefits seen in goal attainment and satisfaction with performance, and no reported harmful effects?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that cognitive rehabilitation is helpful for people with mild or moderate dementia. It improves their ability to do specific tasks they work on, and they report feeling more satisfied with what they can do. No harmful effects were reported.\n- We need more research to find ways to make this therapy more effective and to improve daily life and well-being more broadly.\n- More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen confidence in these findings and to explore the long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, as well as its effects on different subgroups of people with dementia.\n\nWhat is dementia and why is it a problem?\nDementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behavior, making everyday activities challenging. It can be caused by different conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. People with dementia often have problems with thinking and memory, which can make it harder for them to do everyday tasks and live independently. Currently, there are treatments available, but researchers are looking for new approaches to manage the condition.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation and how does it relate to dementia?\nCognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that helps people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence. It is not a cure but rather a way to enable individuals to adapt to their condition. Researchers have studied cognitive rehabilitation as a possible way to improve the lives of people with dementia.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia manage their everyday tasks, what makes it work well, and how it affects care partners. Overall, we wanted to learn if it is a useful tool for helping people with dementia.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with other approaches, such as usual care or no extra therapy. We then summarized the results and rated how certain we are about the evidence. This helps us understand the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday abilities and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80, and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants were diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. We measured the main effect on everyday tasks by looking at whether people achieved the specific goals they set during the therapy. We compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild or moderate dementia improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably helps people achieve the personal goals they set during therapy. For example, people were much more likely to succeed at tasks like learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication. It may also slightly improve their confidence and their ability to remember things right away. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, quality of life, and general functional ability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is that our findings are based on only a few studies, and one large, high-quality study had the biggest impact on the results. This means we are less certain if the results apply to everyone. Also, in these types of studies, people knew they were getting the therapy, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
