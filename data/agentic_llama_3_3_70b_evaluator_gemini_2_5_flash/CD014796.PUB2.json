    "output": "What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different groups, such as healthcare providers and clients, view these checks?\n\nKey messages:\n- People value general health checks for motivation and reassurance, even though they may not reduce deaths or illness.\n- Easy access to health checks and knowing they are available can influence whether people get them.\n- Clearly explaining test results and providing recommendations are important parts of general health checks.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are tests to check the overall health of people who feel well and have no symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the risk of developing diseases and to detect any potential health problems early on. They are usually offered through national programs or commercial providers and may include tests for various diseases and risk factors.\n\nWhy are general health checks a problem?\nDespite being widely used, general health checks have been found to have little effect on reducing deaths or illness. This makes it important to understand why health checks are offered, how they are carried out, and why people decide to get them. General health checks can also lead to unnecessary tests, treatments, and anxiety for individuals.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand how different groups, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. We also wanted to learn what affects why health checks are offered, how they are done, and why people choose to get them.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched online medical databases and other reports to find studies that used interviews or surveys to understand people's experiences with general health checks. We considered studies from any country, setting, and language.\n\nHow did we combine the study findings?\nWe reviewed the studies and pulled out the main ideas about what people thought of health checks. We then combined similar ideas from different studies to find common themes, such as the benefits, the problems, and suggestions for improvement.\n\nWhat did we find about general health checks?\nWe found 146 relevant studies and chose 36 of them for our analysis. These studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most being done in high-income countries in Europe, and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n- People value health checks for motivation and reassurance, even if they have little effect on overall death rates.\n- Fear of bad results or waiting for symptoms to appear can stop people from getting a check.\n- People felt it was important that health checks were easy to get and that providers were skilled and understood their cultural background.\n- Clearly explaining test results and providing recommendations are key elements of general health checks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, which means we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
