    "output": "Can psychostimulants help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy? We looked at the evidence to find out. Myotonic dystrophy is a condition that affects muscles and causes muscle wasting. One common symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness, which can make daily life hard. We wanted to know if psychostimulants, which are medications that increase alertness, can help. We searched for studies that tested psychostimulants in people with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness. We found six studies with 136 people. The studies were short, lasting up to four weeks, and included only adults. Five of the studies compared psychostimulants to a dummy pill. We found that psychostimulants may help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness, but the evidence is not strong. They may also increase the risk of side effects like headaches or nausea. The evidence is limited because the studies were small and different from each other. We need more research to understand the benefits and risks of psychostimulants for people with myotonic dystrophy. The key messages are: psychostimulants may help with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the evidence is not strong; we do not know the long-term effects of psychostimulants; and more research is needed to find out which psychostimulants work best and are safest."
