    "output": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\nKey messages\n- Closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery may help prevent internal hernias (where part of the intestine bulges through a hole), but the evidence is not strong.\n- Closing these defects may reduce the risk of internal hernias, but it probably makes little to no difference to the risk of complications or death after surgery.\n- More high-quality research is needed to provide more certain evidence.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after gastric bypass surgery?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after gastric bypass surgery. It happens when a part of the intestine bulges through a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall, which can cause bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about preventing internal hernia after gastric bypass surgery?\nWe aimed to investigate whether closing defects in the abdominal wall during gastric bypass surgery can help prevent internal hernia. We looked at how often internal hernias, complications after surgery, and deaths occurred. This helped us understand if closing the defects was effective and safe.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after gastric bypass surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with 3010 people who had gastric bypass surgery. The studies compared closing the holes with not closing them. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited mainly because it is based on only three studies. When findings come from a small number of studies, we are less certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024."
