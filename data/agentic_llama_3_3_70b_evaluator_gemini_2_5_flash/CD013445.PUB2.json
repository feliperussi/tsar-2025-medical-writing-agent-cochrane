    "output": "Which surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: PCNL or RIRS?\n\nThis review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One surgery involves making a small cut in the back to remove the stones, called percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The other surgery involves passing a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones, called retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. We compared the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nCompared to RIRS, PCNL appears to be better at clearing stones completely and reducing the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments. However, people who have PCNL may spend about one extra day in the hospital. The risk of serious side effects was similar for both procedures. The risk of developing a ureteral stricture (a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney) appears to be similar for both procedures.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. In most studies, both the patients and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This is a limitation because knowing the treatment could have influenced how they reported outcomes like pain or satisfaction, which can affect the reliability of the results. Finally, most studies did not report where their funding came from.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- PCNL may be better than RIRS at clearing stones and may reduce the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments.\n- PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious side effects but may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- The evidence is not very certain, so more research is needed to confirm these findings."
