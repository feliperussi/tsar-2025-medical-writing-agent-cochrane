    "output": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- Our confidence in this result is low because the studies were small and tested many different types of programs, which makes it hard to compare results and draw firm conclusions.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This major health concern can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. We teach people skills to manage their condition through self-management programs. These programs aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program. We then combined the results and judged how certain the evidence made us.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that in 20 studies, self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and very different from each other. For example, they included people at different stages of visual impairment and used a wide variety of teaching methods, which makes their results difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024."
