    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer) may help people live longer without their cancer getting worse (progression-free survival). However, we are unsure if it helps people live longer overall. It may also lead to more unwanted effects, such as serious side effects (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).\n- Different types of maintenance therapy, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, have varying benefits and harms. For instance, both improved progression-free survival but also increased side effects. More research is needed to fully understand their long-term effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia, and bleeding. Treatment for CLL usually involves chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of both. However, as the disease progresses, the treatment becomes less effective, and the risk of complications increases. We need new and effective treatments to manage CLL.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy involves using drugs to kill cancer cells, while targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically target cancer cells. Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory agents, and targeted therapies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and targeted therapies. They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, with placebo or observation. The median follow-up duration was 12.4 to 73 months. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not reported. We did not find any studies on novel small molecular inhibitors. Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably improves progression-free survival, but may increase adverse events. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival. For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but may also cause more unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search."
