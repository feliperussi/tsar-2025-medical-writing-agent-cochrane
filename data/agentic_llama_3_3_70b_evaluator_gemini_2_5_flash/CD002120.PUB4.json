    "output": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in your period), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick).\n- We are confident in the evidence that the pill reduces pain, but we are less confident about the evidence for side effects and for comparing different types of pills.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of using combined oral contraceptive pills for dysmenorrhoea and compare them directly to other treatments.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, or painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue that affects many women. It's characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Painful menstrual cramps are usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to treat painful menstrual cramps. We also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens to find the best treatment options for women with painful menstrual cramps.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials, where treatments are given to people at random. We looked for trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with a placebo (a dummy pill) or other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce painful menstrual cramps in women more effectively than a placebo. However, they also increase the risk of side effects. For example, the evidence shows that for women who have an 18% chance of irregular bleeding without treatment, taking the pill increases that risk to between 39% and 60%. \n\nWhat about comparing one type of OCP to another?\nWe found that continuous use of OCPs may reduce painful menstrual cramps in women more effectively than the standard regimen. However, there's insufficient evidence to determine if one type of OCP is better than another.\n\nWhat about comparing OCPs to NSAIDs?\nThere's insufficient data to determine whether OCPs are more effective than NSAIDs for pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has some limitations. Many studies were small. In some studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting (this is called a 'lack of blinding' and can affect results). The studies also differed in the types of women included and how the treatments were used, which made them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
