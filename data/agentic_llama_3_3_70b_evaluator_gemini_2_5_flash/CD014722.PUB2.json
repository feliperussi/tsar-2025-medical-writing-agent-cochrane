    "output": "Can primary healthcare workers help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries? We think they can. \nKey messages: \n- Primary healthcare workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, possibly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, we are not confident in this evidence because of flaws in the studies we found.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of these interventions, explore ways to reduce bias, and examine their cost-effectiveness to help inform policy decisions.\nWhat is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries? \nMental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide. People in these countries often face unique challenges. There may not be enough trained health workers, resources are not always shared fairly, and there can be stigma around mental health.\nWhat are the common interventions for preventing mental disorders? \nInterventions for preventing mental disorders can be categorized into three types: universal prevention (targeting the general population), selective prevention (targeting high-risk groups), and indicated prevention (targeting individuals with early signs of mental illness). These interventions can be delivered by primary-level workers, such as community health workers, and may include strategies like counseling, education, and support groups.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if programs run by local health workers could help prevent mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries. We examined the impact of these interventions on mental health outcomes, resource use, and costs. We also sought to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and identify areas for future research.\nWhat search strategy did we use? \nWe searched major medical databases for studies that looked at mental health programs run by local health workers in low- and middle-income countries.\nHow did we synthesize the data? \nWe summarized the results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. Most studies included adults, while 30 studies focused on children. The studies employed various types of primary-level workers and interventions. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, we are not very confident in these results because many of the studies had flaws in their methods and the results from different studies varied a lot.\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, some did not report all outcomes of interest, the populations and delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were small.\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021."
