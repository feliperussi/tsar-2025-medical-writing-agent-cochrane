    "output": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive breathing support methods for preterm infants. These methods include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which gently pushes air into the baby's lungs to keep them open, and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which gives small puffs of air to help with breathing. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy is more likely to fail within 72 hours, meaning the baby might need to switch to a different type of breathing support. But it likely reduces the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n- We need more research to fully understand the benefits and risks of nasal high flow therapy, especially for extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation).\n\n**What is nasal high flow therapy and why is it important for preterm infants?**\nNasal high flow therapy is a way to help premature babies breathe without using a breathing tube. It gently provides warm, moist air and oxygen through two small prongs in the baby's nose. Preterm infants often have trouble breathing soon after birth, which can lead to serious health problems. We treat preterm infants with breathing problems using CPAP or mechanical ventilation. But these treatments have risks, like injuring the baby's lungs or needing a breathing tube put down their throat. Nasal high flow therapy helps preterm infants breathe more easily.\n\n**What did we want to find out about nasal high flow therapy?**\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for preterm infants. We compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP or NIPPV. We wanted to see if nasal high flow therapy reduces the risk of death or long-term lung problems (called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD). We also looked at whether it could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or other treatments.\n\n**How did we do this review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, including CPAP and NIPPV. Compared to these other methods, nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD). It may increase the risk of not working well enough within 72 hours, but it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Nasal high flow therapy likely reduces nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Some studies had weaknesses in their methods, which means we can't be certain the results were caused by the treatments alone. The studies also used different devices and settings, making them hard to compare. Very few of the babies in the studies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks), so the results may not apply to them.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
