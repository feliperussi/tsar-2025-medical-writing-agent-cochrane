    "output": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease.\n- Both types of rehabilitation improve clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n- We need more research to determine the long-term effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It includes conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. For example, a heart attack happens when a lack of blood flow damages the heart muscle. A stroke happens when a lack of blood flow damages the brain.\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nWe define centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes as supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. In home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, people rehabilitate at home with support from healthcare staff. These programmes can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure or cholesterol, in patients with heart disease.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence. This helped us understand how well the programs improved people's health and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only 3 studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. We found that home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes for people who have had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, the studies included a small number of people, which can make the results less reliable. Some studies did not report on all the results we were looking for. Also, in some studies people knew which type of rehabilitation they were getting (this is called not being 'blinded'). Knowing which treatment they received could have influenced how they reported their health and quality of life.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the effectiveness of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease."
