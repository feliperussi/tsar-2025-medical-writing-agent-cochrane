    "output": "Is hospital care at home as effective as hospital care for older adults with acute medical conditions?\n\nKey messages:\n- For older adults with acute medical conditions, hospital care at home probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death) or the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital, but it probably reduces their likelihood of needing to move into residential care.\n- Hospital at home may improve patient satisfaction and probably reduces costs to the health service, however, this is based on low-to-moderate certainty evidence.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of hospital at home and compare different models of care.\n\nWhat is hospital care at home?\nHospital care at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require a hospital stay. This approach is used for a limited time period and is an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care.\n\nWhy is hospital care at home important?\nHospital care at home is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with hospital care at home compared to inpatient hospital care. We aimed to find out whether hospital care at home is a viable alternative to traditional hospital care.\n\nHow did we find the information?\nWe searched for studies that compared hospital care at home with inpatient hospital care. We found 20 studies involving 3100 people, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\nThe review found that for older people, hospital care at home:\n- probably makes little or no difference to mortality (death) or the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital;\n- probably reduces the likelihood of needing to move into residential care;\n- may improve satisfaction with care; and\n- probably reduces costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, many of the studies were small, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. Because the people and the types of 'hospital at home' care were different across the studies, it was difficult to compare their results directly.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
