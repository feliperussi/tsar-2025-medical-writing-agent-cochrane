    "output": "Is intravenous iron (given through a vein) better than oral iron (taken by mouth) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women?\n\nKey Messages\n- Compared to iron taken by mouth, iron given through a vein likely leads to slightly higher levels of hemoglobin (a protein that carries oxygen in the blood). This means fewer pregnant women had anemia when they were treated with intravenous iron.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether intravenous iron increases or decreases the risk of unwanted effects such as severe infections, prolonged hospital stays, or admissions to intensive care units.\n- Future research should look at the long-term effects of both treatments, focus on results that matter most to mothers and babies, and clearly report any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy?\nIron deficiency anemia is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of hemoglobin (a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen). Pregnant women need more iron to help their baby grow, which can lead to iron deficiency anemia. If left untreated, iron deficiency anemia can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy?\nThe common treatments are oral iron supplements (taken by mouth) and intravenous iron preparations (given through a vein). Oral iron supplements are typically the first line of treatment, but doctors may use intravenous iron if oral iron does not work well or causes uncomfortable side effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well intravenous iron works and how safe it is compared to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We aimed to find out whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing hemoglobin levels, reducing anemia, and improving pregnancy outcomes.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing intravenous iron to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 3939 people with iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. Intravenous iron probably slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hemoglobin levels after birth may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on severe anemia after birth is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may make little to no difference in the risk of serious bleeding after birth. It also likely makes little to no difference to the need for a blood transfusion.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies included different types of people and gave the iron treatments in different ways. Also, some studies were very small, and some did not report all their results, which makes the evidence less reliable.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.\n\nFunding\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding."
