    "output": "Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n\n- We found that digital health tools used with standard care may have a small, short-term beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents with obesity. However, the effect on other outcomes like weight loss is unclear. The studies did not report on any potential harmful effects.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in young people. This is partly because the studies were small and did not last very long.\n- We think future studies should investigate the long-term effects of digital health tools, report results for different ages and groups of people, and look at important outcomes like adverse events. This will help us better understand how these tools can be used to help children and teenagers with obesity.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases (long-term health issues). In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how safe and effective digital health tools (like mobile apps and telehealth) are for helping children and teenagers manage obesity. We compared these tools against standard care and looked at their effects on body mass index (a measure of body fat), physical activity, and mental well-being.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with 9 classified as short duration (less than 6 months) and 6 as long duration (6 or more months). Digital health tools combined with standard care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to standard care alone. However, the effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting. This can affect the results because people might change their behavior if they know they are receiving a new treatment. Not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025."
