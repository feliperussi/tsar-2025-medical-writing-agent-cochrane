    "output": "Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n\nWe have three key messages:\n- We are unsure if high-protein formula affects an infant's risk of undernutrition (when a person does not get enough nutrients), overweight, or obesity compared to standard-protein formula, due to a lack of strong evidence.\n- High-protein formula may have little to no effect on side effects like diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements) or vomiting compared to standard-protein formula, but we are not confident in this finding because the evidence is not strong.\n- Future research should focus on the long-term effects of high-protein versus standard-protein formula on infant health, including undernutrition, overweight, obesity, and side effects, to provide clearer guidance for parents and healthcare providers.\n\nWhy is the amount of protein in baby formula important?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth. Some formulas have a high protein content to speed up weight gain during the first year of life. We need to understand the effects of different protein levels in infant formula on the health of formula-fed term infants.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a high-protein formula instead of a standard one affects a healthy infant's risk of undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there is a difference in the risk of side effects like diarrhea or vomiting.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing higher and lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. We looked at studies from high-income countries that lasted up to 11 years.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants. Our main findings were:\n- High-protein vs. standard-protein formula: We are uncertain if high-protein formula affects an infant's risk of undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. It may have little to no effect on side effects, but the evidence for this is not strong.\n- Standard-protein vs. low-protein formula: We are also uncertain about the effect on undernutrition when comparing standard to low-protein formulas. There may be little to no difference in the risk of side effects between the two formulas.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for several reasons:\n- The groups of infants in the studies were very different from each other.\n- The studies were small.\n- The studies were not 'blinded', meaning researchers and parents likely knew which formula infants received. This knowledge could have biased the results, as it might have influenced how the infants were cared for or how the results were interpreted.\nThe studies also did not report on all the health outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
