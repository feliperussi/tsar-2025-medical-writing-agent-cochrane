    "output": "Is using ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body) better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) for giving regional anesthesia (a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body) to adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Using ultrasound guidance for regional anesthesia in adults reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time.\n- It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success.\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is regional anesthesia and why is it important?\nRegional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body, often for surgery. It involves an injection near the nerves in your back. Getting the injection in the right place on the first try is important to reduce problems and improve a patient's experience.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if ultrasound guidance is safer and works better than anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults. We looked at whether it can help patients have a better experience, reduce the number of attempts and the time needed for the procedure, and reduce technical problems, pain, or other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia. We then summarized and combined their results and rated how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. We found strong evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. We also found moderate evidence that it increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. The effect of ultrasound guidance on pain and adverse events is unclear.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are less certain about some findings because:\n- In some studies, patients and doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n- Many of the included studies were small.\n- The studies included different groups of people and used ultrasound in different ways. These differences made it harder to combine the results.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the comparison between ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks for regional anesthesia in adults."
