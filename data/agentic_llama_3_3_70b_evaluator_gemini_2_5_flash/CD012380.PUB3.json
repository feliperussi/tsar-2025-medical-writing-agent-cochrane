    "output": "How can kidney disease be prevented or reduced in people with sickle cell disease?\nWe wanted to know if any treatment can prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood and can cause severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. \n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a severe genetic disorder that affects the blood. It can cause severe pain, significant organ damage, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This condition can lead to serious problems, like having too much protein in the urine (proteinuria) or the kidneys not working well over the long term (chronic kidney insufficiency). \n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include:\n- Red blood cell transfusions: a procedure where healthy red blood cells are given to a person.\n- Hydroxyurea: a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises.\n- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): medicines that help lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys.\nThese treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if any treatment could prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We examined various interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effects on kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. Unfortunately, we found no studies on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nOur main findings were:\n- For hydroxyurea: We are not sure if it improves overall kidney function in children, but it may help their kidneys concentrate urine.\n- For ACEIs: We are not sure if they help prevent or reduce kidney problems in either adults or children.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the current state of knowledge on preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease."
