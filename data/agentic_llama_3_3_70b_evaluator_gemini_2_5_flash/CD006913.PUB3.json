    "output": "Do therapy and counseling improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety for people with inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Talking treatments, like therapy and counseling, probably lead to slight improvements in quality of life and feelings of depression and anxiety for adults with inflammatory bowel disease. No harmful effects were reported.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited, especially for children and adolescents.\n- More research is needed on the long-term effects of these treatments and to compare different types of therapy to help doctors and patients make the best decisions.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression (a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest) and anxiety (a feeling of worry or fear). While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the mental and emotional sides of the condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if talking treatments and other psychological support (like relaxation techniques) could improve quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms for people with IBD.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched major medical research databases for studies that tested talking treatments for people with IBD. We then gathered and combined the results from these studies to understand the effects on quality of life, mood, and disease symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with IBD, including 6111 adults and 294 children and teenagers. Most studies combined different types of support, such as talk therapy and relaxation techniques, and compared these treatments to no therapy, a pretend therapy (also called a sham therapy), or other active treatments. For adults, we found that talking treatments probably slightly improve quality of life and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children and teenagers, talking treatments also appeared to improve their quality of life. However, we found that these psychological treatments may have little to no effect on the physical symptoms of the disease.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence is limited because: \n- The studies were very small.\n- The therapies and people involved varied a lot.\n- People often knew which treatment they were getting, which could affect results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
