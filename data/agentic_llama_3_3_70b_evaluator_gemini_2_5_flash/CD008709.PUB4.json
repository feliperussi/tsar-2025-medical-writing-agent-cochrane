    "output": "Are single-incision sling operations as effective as other types of sling operations for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings (a sling passed behind the pubic bone) and are as effective as transobturator slings (a sling passed through the inner thigh) for treating stress urinary incontinence. However, we are uncertain how they compare with autologous fascial slings (made from the woman's own body tissue).\n- Single-incision slings probably reduce the risk of patient-reported pain after surgery compared to transobturator slings.\n- We concluded that more long-term research is needed to find out how safe and effective single-incision slings are compared to other mid-urethral slings.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. This condition can have a major impact on a person's health, well-being, and finances. Common treatments include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the urethra.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women. We combined and summarized the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other treatments such as autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to other sling types, we found:\n- Transobturator slings: Single-incision slings are just as effective at improving incontinence. They probably cause less long-term pain after surgery. The risk of the mesh material causing complications was similar for both types.\n- Retropubic slings: Single-incision slings may be as effective at improving incontinence, but we are less certain. We are also uncertain about the risk of mesh complications or other complications.\n- Autologous fascial slings: We did not find enough evidence to compare them with single-incision slings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have less confidence in the evidence because in some studies, women and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting, which can bias the results. Also, some studies were very small and did not always measure the long-term outcomes that are most important to patients.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 20 September 2022."
