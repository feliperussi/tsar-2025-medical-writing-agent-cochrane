    "output": "Can changing the schedule of shift work improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers? Here are the key messages from this review:\n- Changing the schedule of shift work may help workers feel less sleepy, but the evidence is uncertain - it is not clear if changing schedules improves how well people sleep, and some changes, like rotating shifts faster, might even reduce how long people sleep.\n- Limiting shift duration to 16 hours may increase sleep duration and reduce sleepiness during shifts, but the evidence for other shift schedule changes is very uncertain.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies to better understand the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem? \nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the bodyâ€™s natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may experience negative effects on their occupational health and safety, including increased risk of accidents and errors.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to know if changing shift work schedules can improve how well and how long workers sleep, and make them feel less sleepy. We looked at different types of changes, such as \n- how quickly shifts rotate \n- the length of each shift \n- the amount of time off between shifts \n- whether workers had a say in their schedules\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 11 studies that involved 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedules. We found that limiting shifts to 16 hours may help workers sleep longer and feel less sleepy. Rotating shifts faster may reduce sleepiness but might also reduce how long people sleep. Changing shift length or compressing the work week seemed to have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness. For most of these findings, the evidence was very uncertain.\n\nHow did we find this information? \nWe searched for studies that changed shift work schedules, then collected and analyzed their results on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness. We also evaluated how well the studies were done to judge how reliable the evidence is.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. Most studies were small and did not always report all their results. The people in the studies and the schedule changes were very different, which makes it hard to compare findings. In some studies, workers knew which schedule they were on, which might have influenced their answers."
