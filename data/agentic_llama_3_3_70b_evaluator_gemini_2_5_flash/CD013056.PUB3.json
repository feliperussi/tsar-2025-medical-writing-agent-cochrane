    "output": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic ear discharge? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotics applied directly to the ear (topical antibiotics) may stop discharge better than antiseptic treatments, but we are uncertain because the evidence is of low quality.\n- Antibiotics called quinolones, when applied to the ear, are likely better at stopping ear discharge within two weeks compared to boric acid (an antiseptic). For every four people treated with these antibiotics instead of boric acid, one extra person's ear discharge will stop.\n- We need more high-quality research to be certain about the best treatment for long-term ear infections with discharge. Future studies should measure important outcomes like quality of life and report on any harmful effects, which were often missing in the studies we found.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum does not heal, which can lead to ear discharge and hearing loss. The infection is often caused by several different types of germs (micro-organisms).\n\nWhat are the common treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media?\nCommon treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically (directly to the ear) or taken systemically (orally or by injection). Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of these treatments is to kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing ear pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nWhat evidence did we find?\nWe searched for studies published up to June 2022 and found 15 relevant trials that included 2371 people with CSOM. The studies compare different types of antibiotics and antiseptics applied directly to the ear.\n\nWhat were the main findings of the review?\nTopical quinolones are likely to increase the resolution of ear discharge compared to boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or antiseptics.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited for a few reasons. The studies included were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect results. Also, the studies did not always report on important outcomes like quality of life or side effects.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
