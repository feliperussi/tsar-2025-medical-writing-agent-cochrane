    "output": "Does controlling blood pressure help prevent or slow down diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that controlling blood pressure may help prevent diabetic retinopathy, especially in people with high blood pressure (hypertension) and type 2 diabetes. \n- The benefits of blood pressure control for preventing diabetic retinopathy seem to be greater for people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. \n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy and other related outcomes.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can cause vision loss and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to bleed or leak fluid. \n\nWhat are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how can blood pressure control help?\nCurrent treatments for diabetic retinopathy include laser surgery, injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications, and vitreoretinal surgery. Controlling blood pressure has been shown to be important in preventing the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure helps prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes. We looked at the effects of more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, and the use of different classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy. Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021."
