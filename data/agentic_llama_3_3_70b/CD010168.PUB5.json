    "output": "# Does using a surgical drain after an operation to remove the appendix help prevent infection and other complications in people with complicated appendicitis (a serious condition where the appendix is gangrenous or has a hole in it)?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Using a surgical drain after an operation to remove the appendix (a procedure known as appendectomy) for complicated appendicitis (a serious condition where the appendix is gangrenous or has a hole in it) may not prevent infection or other complications, but the evidence is very uncertain and does not clearly show benefits or harms, including unwanted effects such as increased risk of mortality.\n- The current evidence does not support the use of abdominal drainage in preventing intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, highlighting the need for larger, well-designed studies to determine the effects of drainage on outcomes such as mortality.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger studies to more reliably determine the effects of abdominal drainage on important outcomes, including mortality, and to address the significant uncertainty surrounding the use of surgical drains in people with complicated appendicitis undergoing appendectomy.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why is it a problem?\nComplicated appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous or perforated, leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, people who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications, such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, and morbidity.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. They also aimed to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains and to determine the optimal time for drain removal. Additionally, they sought to investigate whether abdominal drainage can prevent intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\n\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registries for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared abdominal drainage with no drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. No language restrictions were applied and the search was updated to June 2024.\nEligibility Criteria\nWe included studies enrolling patients undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated or gangrenous appendicitis where postoperative abdominal drainage was either placed or omitted. Trials had to report at least one clinical outcome such as intra‑abdominal abscess, wound infection, length of stay, or mortality.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); for continuous outcomes we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. Meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model.\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nRisk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for randomized trials and ROBINS‑I for non‑randomized studies. Domains assessed included randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting.\nConfidence in the Evidence\nThe overall certainty of the evidence was graded using GRADE. For the primary outcome (post‑operative intra‑abdominal abscess) the evidence was rated moderate due to imprecision and heterogeneity across studies. Other outcomes were rated low to very low because of limited sample sizes and risk of bias.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal. This Cochrane review was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, Medical Research Projects of Chongqing, and the Kuanren Talents Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The use of abdominal drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis may increase the risk of mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if abdominal drainage has an effect on intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the studies involved different types of participants and varied delivery methods, creating heterogeneity.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023."
