    "output": "Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey messages:\n- Favipiravir, an antiviral drug (a type of medicine that fights viruses), may not have a clear benefit for treating COVID-19. \n- The use of favipiravir may lead to an increase in adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects). \n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in knowledge about favipiravir's effectiveness and safety for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. It has spread rapidly around the world, causing a pandemic that has challenged healthcare systems and societies globally. COVID-19 can cause a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, and can lead to serious health problems, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about favipiravir?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of favipiravir, an antiviral medication, in people with COVID-19. We compared favipiravir to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatments. We evaluated its impact on outcomes such as all-cause mortality (death rate), progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (a life-support treatment that helps people breathe), need for hospital admission, time to clinical improvement, and incidence of adverse events.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease and were under 60 years of age. The studies were conducted in 13 countries. Favipiravir may not significantly reduce all-cause mortality. It also may not impact the need for mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, or the time it takes to see clinical improvement. However, it may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023."
