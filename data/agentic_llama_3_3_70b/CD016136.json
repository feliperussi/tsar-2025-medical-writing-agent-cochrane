    "output": "# Is intravenous iron (given through a vein) better than oral iron (taken by mouth) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women?\n**Key Messages**\n- In pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron (given through a vein) likely slightly increases hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) levels and reduces anemia compared to oral iron (taken by mouth), but the evidence about its effects on serious pregnancy complications is uncertain.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether intravenous iron increases or decreases the risk of unwanted effects such as severe infections, prolonged hospital stays, or admissions to intensive care units, and more research is needed to understand its safety and effectiveness fully.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of intravenous versus oral iron, focus on outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as the impact on maternal and infant health, and improve the reporting of adverse events to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n**Introduction**\n## What is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\nIron deficiency anaemia is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of haemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to different parts of the body. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia can occur due to the increased demand for iron to support the growth of the baby. This condition can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications for both the mother and the baby. Common treatments for iron deficiency anaemia include oral iron supplements and intravenous iron therapy.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. They aimed to find out whether intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron in increasing haemoglobin levels, reducing anaemia, and improving outcomes for mothers and babies. They also wanted to assess the potential risks and side effects associated with intravenous iron therapy.\n**Methods**\n## Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing intravenous iron to oral iron for treating iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 3939 people with iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. The studies were mainly conducted in India and Africa. The gestational age at baseline ranged from 13 to 37 weeks, and Hb levels ranged from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most frequently compared preparations were intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate. Most RCTs were at low risk of bias. This Cochrane Review was partially funded by the WHO and was supported by the UK Medical Research Council funding. Intravenous iron probably slightly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces anemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Intravenous iron may slightly increase hemoglobin levels postpartum, but its effect on postpartum severe anemia is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may make little to no difference in postpartum hemorrhage and blood transfusion rates. The effects of intravenous iron on maternal mortality and admissions to the intensive care unit are very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
