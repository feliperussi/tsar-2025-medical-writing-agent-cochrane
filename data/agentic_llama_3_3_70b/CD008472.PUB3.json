    "output": "Is remote ischaemic preconditioning (a technique where blood flow to a limb is temporarily blocked to protect against tissue damage during surgery) effective in reducing complications during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures?\n\nKey messages:\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably leads to little or no difference in reducing complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke, during major vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n- The quality of evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer, and more research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of remote ischaemic preconditioning.\n- Future studies should investigate remote ischaemic preconditioning further, focusing on important outcomes for patients and healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it important for people undergoing vascular surgery?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where blood flow to a part of the body, such as an arm or leg, is temporarily blocked and then restored. This process has been shown to protect tissues from damage caused by lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery can be risky and may lead to serious complications, including death. RIPC has the potential to reduce the risk of these complications by protecting the tissues from damage.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke, in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. They also wanted to know if RIPC has any effect on the length of hospital stay and operating time.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant populations and intervention delivery methods, and a high risk of exaggerating benefits.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022."
