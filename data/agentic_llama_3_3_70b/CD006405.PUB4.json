    "output": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\n- We compared nasal high flow therapy with other non-invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (a treatment that delivers air into the airways to keep them open) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (a treatment that delivers bursts of air into the airways to help breathing), for helping preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) breathe. \n- Nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as these methods, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy may result in more treatment failures (when the treatment does not work and the baby needs more intensive care) within 72 hours. \n- However, it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose).\n\nWhat is nasal high flow therapy and how is it used in preterm infants?\n- Nasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. \n- We use it to help preterm infants breathe, either to avoid or before using mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube. \n- This is for prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (a condition that can cause breathing difficulties in preterm infants due to a lack of surfactant, a substance that helps lungs expand and contract properly).\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?\n- While nasal high flow therapy may be beneficial, it also carries potential risks. \n- For instance, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours. \n- But it may also reduce the risk of nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support like CPAP or NIPPV.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?\n- The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy for primary respiratory support in preterm infants. \n- They compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. \n- Specifically, they wanted to assess its effectiveness in reducing the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (a condition that can cause breathing difficulties in preterm infants), and other complications.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\n- We searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. \n- We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\n- We found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. \n- These studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP and NIPPV. \n- The population characteristics included preterm infants born less than 37 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress soon after birth.\n\nMain results: Nasal high flow therapy for preterm infants\n- Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. \n- However, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours. \n- Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n- The evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different delivery methods. \n- They were very small and not randomized, so any observed differences could be due to differences between participants rather than the interventions themselves.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n- This review updates our previous review. \n- The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
