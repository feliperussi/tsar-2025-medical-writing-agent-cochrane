    "output": "Are single-incision sling operations as effective as other surgical methods for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as other surgical methods, such as retropubic slings (which go behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (which go through the obturator membrane), for treating stress urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine, often during physical activity) in women.\n- Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings.\n- Future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings.\n\n**What is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?**\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nWe wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women. We compared the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects) and longer-term outcomes.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe found that the evidence is limited by potential bias, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity in populations, interventions, and comparators. Many studies are small, involve few cases, or are insufficient in number, reducing confidence in the overall findings.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
