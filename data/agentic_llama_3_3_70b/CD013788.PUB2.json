    "output": "Is removing the urinary catheter early or late better for preventing infections after a kidney transplant (a surgery where a person receives a new kidney)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if removing the urinary catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes a difference in preventing infections, including urinary tract infections (infections of the system that produces, stores, and carries urine).\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and harms of early versus late removal of the urinary catheter.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality, well-designed studies that compare early and late catheter removal after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is it important?\nKidney transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves replacing a diseased or damaged kidney with a healthy one from a donor. It is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease, which is a condition where the kidneys are no longer able to function properly. During the operation, a catheter (a tube that allows fluid to drain) is introduced into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, and the longer they remain in place, the greater the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\nWhat are the potential complications of urinary catheter use after kidney transplantation?\nThe use of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation can lead to complications such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can be symptomatic (causing symptoms) or asymptomatic (without symptoms). Symptomatic UTIs can cause symptoms such as pain, fever, and discomfort, while asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to the presence of bacteria in the urine without any symptoms. Other potential complications include major urological complications, such as anastomotic breakdown (a breakdown of the connection between the kidney and the bladder), which can require intervention and treatment.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the effectiveness of early versus late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. They aimed to find out whether removing the catheter early (less than 5 days after surgery) or late (5 days or more after surgery) made a difference in the incidence of symptomatic UTIs, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and major urological complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing early and late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 197 people who underwent kidney transplantation. The studies were conducted to compare the effectiveness of early versus late removal of urinary catheters post-transplant. It is uncertain whether removing the urinary catheter early or late after kidney transplantation has an effect on the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. We do not know if early or late removal of the urinary catheter has an effect on the incidence of urinary tract infections or major urological complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
