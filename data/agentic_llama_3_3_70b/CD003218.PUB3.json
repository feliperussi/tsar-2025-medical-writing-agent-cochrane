    "output": "Psychostimulants may reduce daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy, though evidence is limited\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychostimulants may help reduce daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy - a condition where muscles have difficulty relaxing after contraction. However, we need more research to confirm this.\n- We do not know the long-term effects of psychostimulants on daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy.\n- Future studies should look at how well psychostimulants work and how safe they are in the short and long term.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. This condition can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with myotonic dystrophy. We aimed to determine whether psychostimulants can improve daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, for studies evaluating psychostimulants in myotonic dystrophy patients with excessive daytime sleepiness. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional reports.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them for up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. The studies evaluated the effects of psychostimulants, such as modafinil, compared to a placebo or no treatment. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is uncertain. They may also increase the risk of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations with different methods of delivering the intervention. This reduces confidence in the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023."
