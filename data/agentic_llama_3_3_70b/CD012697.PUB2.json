    "output": "Is magnetic seizure therapy as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?\nWe looked at whether magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) is as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia.\n\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia, but the current evidence is based on only one study and has significant limitations.\n- The available study suggests that magnetic seizure therapy might cause fewer unwanted effects, such as delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration, compared to ECT.\n- More well-designed studies are needed to determine the true effects and potential benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It can cause hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there), delusions (believing things that are not true), disorganized thinking, and a lack of motivation, making everyday life challenging. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics (the main treatment for schizophrenia) and need to seek other treatment options.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy (how well a treatment works) and tolerability (how well a treatment is accepted by patients) of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) for people with schizophrenia. They aimed to compare MST with other treatments, such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), to see if it can improve symptoms and quality of life for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, and the study did not report all the outcomes. The small sample size of the trial also reduces statistical power and precision.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.\n\nWe need more well-designed studies to determine the true effects and potential benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia. The current evidence is not reliable enough to inform treatment decisions."
