    "output": "Is a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane flap better than the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes?\n- We compared a surgical technique using an internal limiting membrane (a thin layer of tissue in the eye) flap to the standard peeling method for treating large macular holes (a condition where there is a hole in the part of the eye responsible for central vision). The evidence suggests that the internal limiting membrane flap technique may be better for improving vision and closing the hole, but the quality of the evidence is not strong.\n- The internal limiting membrane flap technique may have benefits over the standard peeling method, including better vision outcomes at three or more months after surgery and a higher rate of macular hole closure. However, harmful effects were not well reported in the studies.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies that compare these two techniques directly and measure outcomes over a longer period, including potential harmful effects, to provide clearer answers for people with large macular holes and their healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a full-thickness defect in the central portion of the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye) that causes loss of central vision. This can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces difficult. Macular holes can be classified based on their size, with large macular holes having a diameter greater than 400 µm at the narrowest point. The standard treatment for macular holes is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, but this technique has a higher failure rate for large macular holes compared to smaller ones.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy with the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique compared to pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for treating large macular holes. They aimed to determine if the inverted ILM flap technique is superior to conventional ILM peeling in terms of anatomical and functional outcomes, such as mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular hole closure rates.\n\nHow did the authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies comparing pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique versus conventional ILM peeling in patients with large macular holes (≥400 µm). Keywords included \"macular hole\", \"pars plana vitrectomy\", \"internal limiting membrane flap\", and \"ILM peeling\" and were combined with Boolean operators. No date or language restrictions were applied.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nWe included randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts, and retrospective comparative studies that reported anatomical closure rates or best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) outcomes for large macular holes treated with either the ILM flap or conventional peeling. Studies lacking a comparator group, not reporting relevant outcomes, or focusing on holes <400 µm were excluded.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found four studies that involved 275 people with large macular holes. The studies were conducted in countries such as India, Poland, and Mexico, with most participants being women and of older age, ranging from 59.4 to 66 years. The maximum follow-up ranged from 3 months to 12 months. No studies reported conflicts of interest or disclosed financial support. All four studies compared conventional pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling versus pars plana vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting membrane flap techniques for treating large macular holes. The new surgical method might help improve vision a bit and could increase the chances of closing the hole in the macula compared to the usual method.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants knew their treatment), they were very small, and they involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, leading to a high risk of bias and limited generalizability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- The internal limiting membrane flap technique may be better than the standard peeling method for improving vision and closing large macular holes.\n- The internal limiting membrane flap technique may have benefits over the standard peeling method, including better vision outcomes at 3 or more months after surgery and a higher rate of macular hole closure.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies that compare these two techniques directly and measure outcomes over a longer period, including potential harmful effects."
