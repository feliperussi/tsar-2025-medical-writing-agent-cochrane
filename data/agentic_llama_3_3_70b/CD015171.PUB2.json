    "output": "Benefits and side effects of betahistine and other drugs for Ménière’s disease\n\nWhat are the key messages from this review?\n- We are not confident about the benefits and risks of betahistine and other drugs for Ménière’s disease because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n- There are few high-quality studies that compare these drugs to a placebo or no treatment, and the evidence we have is not reliable.\n- Future research should focus on what is important to patients and doctors, such as the benefits and harms of different treatments, and should use standardized measures to guide studies.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nMénière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. Various treatments, such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids, have been used to manage the condition. However, it is unclear how well these treatments work in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of drugs compared to a placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in improving vertigo, reducing symptoms, and enhancing quality of life, while also considering potential adverse effects.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared drugs with a placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Ménière's disease. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. The studies were conducted for a duration of 3 to 12 months or more, with some studies reporting outcomes at 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months, and > 12 months.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all the people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
