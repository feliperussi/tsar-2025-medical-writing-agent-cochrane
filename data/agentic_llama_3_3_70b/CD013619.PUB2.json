    "output": "Does having family members present during resuscitation (when medical staff are trying to save a patient's life) help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\nKey messages:\n- We think family presence during resuscitation may help reduce stress and anxiety in family members, but the current evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the benefits and potential harms.\n- The available studies had significant limitations, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of family presence during resuscitation on relatives' psychological outcomes, as well as on patient care and healthcare professionals' experiences.\n- Future studies should investigate the impact of family presence during resuscitation with more robust methods and larger participant groups to provide clearer answers about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation (FPDR) refers to the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. This practice involves a relationship between the healthcare professionals, the relatives, and the patient. FPDR is based on the principle that patients and their relatives often want to be actively involved in treatment decisions, even during critical care situations like resuscitation (resuscitation: helping someone who is very sick or injured to recover).\n\nWhy is family presence during resuscitation important?\nFPDR is important because it addresses the emotional and psychological needs of both the patients and their relatives during a critical and potentially traumatic event. The presence of relatives can provide emotional support to the patient and help relatives cope with the situation, potentially reducing stress and anxiety. However, it also raises concerns about the impact on healthcare professionals, patient care, and the relatives' own psychological well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation affects the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives. They also wanted to explore the impact of FPDR on other psychological outcomes in relatives, patient morbidity (morbidity: the state of being diseased) and mortality (mortality: death rate), medical treatment and care during resuscitation, and the personal stress experienced by healthcare professionals.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies on family presence during resuscitation and summarized their results. We rated our confidence in the evidence to understand its effects on relatives' psychological outcomes and patient care.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for different durations, with one study having a 1-year assessment. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of PTSD-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and had methodological flaws. The studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the participants may have known their treatment.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
