    "output": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey messages:\n- Myotonic disorders cause muscle stiffness - we found that mexiletine, a medicine that blocks sodium channels, likely reduces muscle stiffness in people with non-dystrophic myotonia.\n- However, its effectiveness in people with myotonic dystrophy is less clear - mexiletine may cause unwanted effects like gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache.\n- Lamotrigine, another medicine tested, may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with myotonic disorders, but the evidence is not as strong as for mexiletine.\n\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, causing stiffness, cramps, and pain. It can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders. Myotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias and cataracts.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe investigated the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. We wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind randomized controlled trials involving a total of 392 participants. We found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia and may improve quality of life. However, it is unclear if mexiletine has an effect on myotonia in people with myotonic dystrophy. Lamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence is not certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
