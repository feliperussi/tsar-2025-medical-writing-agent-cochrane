    "output": "Can hormone treatments help reduce pain in women with endometriosis, and are they safe?\n- We looked at whether hormone treatments can help reduce pain in women with endometriosis. \n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain, but hormone treatments may help reduce pain. \n- They may also cause unwanted effects such as hot flushes (a feeling of warmth spreading through the body, often accompanied by sweating and a flushed face).\n\nWhat is endometriosis and why is it a problem?\nEndometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that affects 6 to 11% of women of reproductive age. \n- It can cause painful symptoms such as dyspareunia (painful intercourse), dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation), and infertility. \n- Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of hormone treatments in the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. \n- We also aimed to determine the effects of hormone treatments on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis. \n- We compared hormone treatments with other treatment options, including placebo, danazol, analgesics, and intra-uterine progestogens.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of relevant databases to identify studies that compared hormone treatments with other treatments for endometriosis. \n- We screened eligible studies against predefined criteria and extracted data on effectiveness and safety outcomes for analysis. \n- We evaluated the risk of bias in each study and rated the overall confidence in the body of evidence using established grading methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 72 studies that involved 7355 people with endometriosis. \n- The studies compared hormone treatments with other treatment options, including placebo, danazol, analgesics, intra-uterine progestogens, oral or injectable progestogens, and gestrinone. \n- Some studies also compared hormone treatments with hormone treatments in conjunction with add-back therapy or calcium-regulating agents.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nHormone treatments may reduce overall pain in women with endometriosis, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \n- They may also cause more hot flushes. \n- The treatment may have little to no effect on bone mineral density when compared to some other treatments, but it is unclear. \n- For every 100 women treated with hormone treatments, 10 to 20 may experience a reduction in pain, compared to 5 to 10 women who receive no treatment or a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on every outcome of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022."
