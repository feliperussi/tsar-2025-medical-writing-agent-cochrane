    "output": "Is using a bronchoscope (a tube to look into the lungs) to guide antibiotic treatment more effective than standard treatment for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey messages:\n- Bronchoscopy (a procedure that uses a tube to look into the lungs) to guide antibiotic treatment may have little or no difference in effectiveness compared to standard treatment for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis, in terms of benefits and unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The current evidence does not support the routine use of bronchoscopy for diagnosing and managing pulmonary (relating to the lungs) infections in preschool children with cystic fibrosis, and there is no evidence available for adults.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of bronchoscopy-guided antibiotic treatment and compare it directly with standard care.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?\nThe main goal of treating lung infections in people with CF is to clear the infection and prevent further damage to the lungs. Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of using bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in managing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. They aimed to compare the outcomes of this approach with standard care.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to other approaches. We found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures.\n\nResults\nBronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy may make little to no difference in lung function. It may lead to more hospitalizations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023."
