    "output": "Is receiving hospital care at home as effective as being in the hospital for older adults who need acute care?\n\nKey messages:\n- Hospital at home care probably makes little or no difference in mortality or the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital for older adults who need acute care, compared to being in the hospital.\n- Hospital at home care may improve satisfaction with healthcare and probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care, as well as decreasing costs to the health service.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies to better understand the effectiveness and potential harms of hospital at home care for older adults with different conditions and needs.\n\nWhat is hospital at home care?\nHospital at home care is when healthcare professionals treat you at home for conditions that would normally need hospital care. This care is typically provided for a limited time period and can be an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care.\n\nWhy is hospital at home care important?\nHospital at home care is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce healthcare costs and improve patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if hospital at home care is as effective and cost-efficient as traditional hospital care. We aimed to determine whether this type of care can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient satisfaction.\n\nHow did we find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing hospital at home care with inpatient hospital care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with these approaches.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 3100 participants. The studies were conducted to compare hospital at home care with acute hospital inpatient care. Most studies recruited participants with a mix of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe), recovering from a stroke (a condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted), and acute medical conditions (sudden illnesses or injuries), mainly in older populations. Hospital at home care probably makes little to no difference to patient health outcomes, may improve satisfaction, probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care, and probably decreases costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
