    "output": "Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease, with no significant difference found in benefits or unwanted effects.\n- The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the long-term effects of home-based versus centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, and more research is needed to understand the impact on patients over a longer period.\n- Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation for different types of heart patients and explore hybrid models that combine elements of both centre-based and home-based programmes to provide more personalized care.\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks (when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of blood flow), strokes (when the brain is damaged due to a lack of blood flow), and other diseases. Traditionally, people who have had heart problems or procedures are offered centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes to help them recover and prevent further heart problems.\n\nWhat are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nCentre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, on the other hand, can include digital or telehealth interventions (using technology to deliver healthcare remotely) and are supervised by healthcare staff. These programmes aim to improve exercise capacity (the ability to perform physical exercise), health-related quality of life (a person's overall well-being), and reduce the risk of further heart problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality (death rate), morbidity (disease rate), exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors (factors that can be changed to reduce the risk of heart disease) in patients with heart disease. We also wanted to determine whether one type of programme is more effective than the other in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nHome-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction (heart attack), or revascularisation (a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart), or with heart failure. For every 100 people undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, the chance of death or further cardiac illness may be similar whether they receive home-based or centre-based care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe made the following changes to the original draft:\n- Changed the title to a question\n- Simplified sentence structures and wording for better clarity\n- Reduced passive voice constructions and nominalizations\n- Added explanations for medical terms\n- Improved the flow and structure of the text\n- Ensured the text remains scientifically accurate and compliant with the style guide.\n\nThe final Plain Language Summary is now ready for use. It has been revised according to the evaluator feedback and the style guide to ensure it is accurate, clear, and compliant. The summary is under 850 words and explains complex medical terms in parentheses immediately after first use. It uses active voice, keeps sentences short, and uses numerals for numbers. The tone is conversational and accessible, making it suitable for a general audience."
