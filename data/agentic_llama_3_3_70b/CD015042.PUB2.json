    "output": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\n- We found that brief counseling sessions may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy. However, the evidence is not very strong.\n- No studies were found that tested medications for treating alcohol use disorder (a condition where a person's alcohol use causes significant problems) in pregnant women.\n- More research is needed to understand how to best help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant health concern. It can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby. Despite the known risks, many pregnant women continue to drink alcohol. Globally, it's estimated that 10% of pregnant women consume alcohol, with up to 25% doing so in Europe.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nTo address this issue, various interventions have been implemented. These include counseling sessions and medications. Counseling sessions typically involve advice and support to help pregnant women reduce or stop their alcohol consumption.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in helping pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy. We looked at the effectiveness of counseling sessions and medications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. Most studies evaluated the effectiveness of counseling sessions. These sessions were mainly brief interventions. Pregnant women received the counseling session approximately at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. The outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the counseling session.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.\n\nWe used standard methods to search for and evaluate studies. We included studies that compared interventions to reduce or stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Our main outcomes of interest were abstinence from alcohol, reduction in alcohol consumption, retention in treatment, and women with any adverse event.\n\nBrief counseling sessions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the evidence is not very strong. More research is needed to understand how to best help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy. This includes studies that look at the long-term effects of different treatments and provide more detailed information about the women's alcohol use before and during pregnancy."
