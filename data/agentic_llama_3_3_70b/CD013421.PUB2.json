    "output": "Do sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) help stop bleeding faster and reduce complications during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels)?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if sealants are effective in stopping bleeding during vascular surgery. Here are the key points:\n- Sealants may help stop bleeding faster during vascular surgery, but the evidence is not strong.\n- Sealants do not seem to reduce the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to perform the surgery, or the risk of bleeding after the operation.\n- More research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the benefits and potential harms of using sealants in vascular surgery.\n\nWhat is anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery?\nDuring vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts (called anastomoses) may be necessary. These connections can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure. Stopping the bleeding (achieving hemostasis) is crucial in vascular surgery. Various surgical options are available to achieve hemostasis, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues.\n\nWhat are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?\nSealants are special materials used in vascular surgery to help stop bleeding when other methods are not working. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, the evidence for their clinical efficacy in vascular surgery patients has not been definitively established.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants as adjuncts for achieving anastomotic site hemostasis in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to compare the outcomes of sealant use with alternative interventions, such as manual compression or reversal of anticoagulation, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants who underwent vascular surgery. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding and the rate at which bleeding stops, but it is unclear if they have an effect on the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery. For every 100 people who receive sealants, 10 to 20 more may have their bleeding stopped quickly compared to those who do not receive sealants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that participants were aware of which treatment they were receiving (risk of performance bias). Not all studies reported data for all outcomes of interest, leading to incomplete information. The studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations and used different delivery methods for the intervention, reducing comparability. Sample sizes were very small, limiting statistical power. Moreover, the studies that did provide results for our review likely overestimate the benefits of the intervention because they represent only a small, possibly selective subset of the available research.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
