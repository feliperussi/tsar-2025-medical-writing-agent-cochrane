    "output": "Does exposure to the smell and taste of milk help preterm infants start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nWe looked at studies that compared preterm infants who were given the smell and taste of milk with those who were not. Here are the key messages:\n- Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time it takes for preterm infants to start sucking feeds. \n- The current evidence does not suggest significant benefits or harms of this intervention. However, the studies had limitations, such as small sample sizes and methodological issues.\n- Future research should investigate the effects of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm infants often have trouble feeding because their sucking, swallowing, and breathing muscles are not fully developed. This can lead to feeding intolerance, which means they have trouble digesting food.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to know if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed can help them start sucking feeds sooner. They also wanted to find out if this approach is safe and does not cause any harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. The studies were conducted to assess whether exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and the studies involved different types of people and used different delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
