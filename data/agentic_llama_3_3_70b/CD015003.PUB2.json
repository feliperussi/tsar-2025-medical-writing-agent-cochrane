    "output": "Can colchicine help prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had a heart problem before?\n\nWe found that colchicine may help reduce the risk of death from any cause in people who have not had a heart problem before. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. It may also increase the risk of diarrhea.\n\nWhat is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a condition where the arteries become clogged with fatty substances. This leads to chronic inflammation and potentially life-threatening complications. It is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.\n\nWhat is colchicine and how might it help with ACVD prevention?\nColchicine is a medicine with anti-inflammatory properties. It has been used for centuries. Its potential role in preventing ACVD is of interest due to its ability to reduce inflammation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the clinical benefits and harms of using colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population. We compared colchicine to placebo, immunomodulating medications, or usual care.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies comparing colchicine to other treatments for preventing cardiovascular events. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 1721 people. The studies were conducted with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks. The intervention was oral colchicine compared with placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nColchicine may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. However, it is unclear if it has an effect on non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhea. The evidence is very uncertain for all outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small. Participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment. The available data do not cover all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- Colchicine may help reduce the risk of death from any cause in people who have not had a heart problem before. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. It may also increase the risk of diarrhea.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether colchicine can prevent heart attacks or strokes in people without prior heart problems.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of colchicine on heart health in a more rigorous and unbiased manner. This will help doctors and patients make informed decisions about its use for preventing cardiovascular events."
