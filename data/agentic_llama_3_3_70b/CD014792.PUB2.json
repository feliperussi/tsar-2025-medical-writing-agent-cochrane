    "output": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and do they improve recovery?\n\nWe compared different methods of providing nutrients after pancreatic surgery. Enteral nutrition - giving nutrients directly into the gut - through a jejunostomy, likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition - giving nutrients through a vein. However, it may have little to no difference in complications after surgery.\n\nHere are the key messages from our review:\n- Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, but may have little to no difference in complications.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding and eating by mouth, shows little to no difference in hospital stay or complications, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to understand the best nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery.\n\nWhat is pancreatic surgery and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, usually due to cancer, benign tumors, or chronic pancreatitis. After this major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following pancreatic surgery, and providing appropriate nutritional support is essential to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nutritional support after pancreatic surgery?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreatic surgery. We wanted to compare the outcomes of various nutritional interventions, such as enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition, to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients after this surgery.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 17 studies that involved 1897 people who underwent pancreatic surgery. The studies compared different routes and timings of postoperative nutritional support, including enteral feeding via jejunostomy, nasojejunal tube, or gastrojejunostomy, parenteral nutrition, and oral intake.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral feeding by nasojejunal tube may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy feeding may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with oral nutrition, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, the studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
