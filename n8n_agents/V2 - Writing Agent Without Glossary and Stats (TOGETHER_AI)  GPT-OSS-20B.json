You MUST follow this structured process and all rules precisely.\n\n**Step 1: Adhere to the Core Structure**\n- You MUST create a list of **no less than 2 and no more than 3** bullet points.\n- **First Key Message:** MUST directly answer the REVIEW_QUESTION. It must include the most important findings on benefits and unwanted or harmful effects.\n    - If harmful effects were not reported, you MUST state that explicitly.\n    - If the review could not answer the question (e.g., no studies found), state this and the reason why.\n- **Second Key Message (Optional):** You may include a second message if there is another significant finding or important secondary objective to report.\n- **Final Key Message:** MUST state what should happen next.

This is non-negotiable as readers see this section first.\n- **Be Neutral and Nuanced:** Your tone must be neutral. Do not exaggerate benefits or harms. Mention if a finding applies only to a specific subgroup of the population.\n- **State Quality of Evidence:** Give the reader a sense of the quality of the evidence in simple terms (e.g., \"Due to a lack of robust evidence...\", \"We did not find enough good-quality evidence...\").\n\n**Step 3: Obey Prohibitions**\n- **DO NOT** make any recommendations for or against a treatment.\n- **DO NOT** include any statistics, numbers, confidence intervals, or GRADE jargon like \"low-certainty evidence\" or \"risk of bias\".\n\n*This is the style and quality you must emulate.*\n**Topic: comparison of different beds for treating pressure ulcers**\n- \"Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers for treating pressure ulcers are unclear.\"\n- \"Beds with an air-filled surface that applies constant pressure to the skin may be better than mattresses and toppers made of foam for ulcer healing, but may cost more.\"\n- \"Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.\"\n\n**Topic: pharmacologic interventions for mydriasis in cataract surgery**\n- \"We did not find enough good-quality evidence about the best way to deliver medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery. We found only one study that had enrolled a large enough number of people to give reliable results.\"\n- \"Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering these medicines.\"\n\n**Topic: rapid tests for strep sore throat in children**\n- \"The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics.\"\n- \"The number of children receiving unnecessary antibiotics following a rapid test is still likely to be lower than the number of children who would receive unnecessary antibiotics if the test is not used.\"\n- \"Both types of rapid tests studied in the review had similar accuracy.\"\n\n**Topic: pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis**\n- \"After six months of treatment, medicines called 'biologics' seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin.\"\n- \"Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis.\"\n- \"More studies are needed that compare these types of medicines directly against each other.\"\n\n**Topic: interleukin-6 blocking agents for treating COVID-19**\n- \"Treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin-6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment.\"\n- \"Studies of other medicines that block interleukin-6 to treat COVID-19 are under way.

Based on this analysis, decide on the best structure:\n\n    - **DEFAULT (Single Section):** If the findings are straightforward or short, combine the characteristics summary and the findings summary into a single, coherent text under the subheading \"What did we find?\".\n    - **OPTIONAL (Two Sections):** If there is a very clear and important primary outcome that deserves to be highlighted, create two separate sections: \"What did we find?\" (containing only the characteristics) and \"Main results: [subtitle]\" (containing only the findings).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Final JSON:** Create the final JSON object based on your decision, following the specified output format.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nYour response must be a single JSON object containing a key named `sections`.

The overall **level of certainty** in the evidence (e.g., \"moderate certainty,\" \"low certainty\").\n  2. The specific **technical reasons** given for that level of certainty (e.g., \"risk of bias,\" \"imprecision,\" \"inconsistency\").\n\n**Step 2: Translate and Synthesize using the Guide**\n- **Part A (The Opening Phrase):** Use the identified certainty level to find the exact starting sentence from the `certainty_wording` section of your LIMITATIONS_GUIDE.\n- **Part B (The Reasons):** For each technical reason you identified, find its exact plain language equivalent in the `reason_wording` section of the guide.\n- **Part C (Combine):** Create a single, concise paragraph by combining the opening phrase from Part A with the plain language reasons from Part B.\n\n### PROHIBITIONS (STRICTLY ENFORCED) ###\n- **DO NOT USE ANY JARGON.** You are explicitly forbidden from using the technical terms you find in the abstract in your final output. Your entire job is to translate them.\n- **FORBIDDEN WORDS INCLUDE:** `downgrading`, `very low/low/moderate/high certainty evidence`, `risk of bias`, `indirectness`, `imprecision`, `inconsistency`, `publication bias`.\n\n### EXAMPLE OF THE PROCESS ###\n- **If the abstract says:** \"The evidence was of low certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision.\"\n- **Your thought process:**\n    1.  Certainty level is \"Low certainty\". Look it up in `certainty_wording`. The phrase is: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because...\"\n    2.  Reason 1 is \"Risk of bias\". Look it up in `reason_wording`. The phrase is: \"It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\"\n    3.  Reason 2 is \"Imprecision\". Look it up in `reason_wording`. The phrase is: \"The studies were very small.\"\n    4.  Combine them.\n- **CORRECT OUTPUT:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\"\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\nYour response must be ONLY a single JSON object with one key, \"limitations_of_evidence\", containing the final paragraph as a single string.",

Title:\n   {{ $('Plain Titles Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n2. Key messages:\n   {{ $('Key messages Agent').last().json.output.key_messages.toJsonString()}}\n3. Introduction/Aims:\n   {{ $('Background Writer Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n4. Methods:\n   {{ $('Methods Summarizer Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n5.

Currency:\n   {{ $('Date Extraction Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n\n**MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE:**\n**5.2 Style**\n\n- **Conciseness:** Be concise. Replace 'wordy' phrases (e.g., 'during the course of' with 'during'; 'due to the fact that' with 'because').\n- **Active Voice:** Use active voice (e.g., 'We compared the results') not passive voice (e.g., 'The results of the studies were compared').\n- **Pronouns:** Use first-person plural ('we', 'our') for review authors.\n- **Verbs:** Use direct verbs (e.g., 'the students investigated' not 'the students conducted an investigation').\n- **Numerals:** Write numbers as numerals (1, 2, 3) not words, unless starting a sentence.\n\n**5.3 Structure**\n\n- **Subheadings:** Use subheadings to guide the reader. Phrase subheadings as questions where possible (e.g., 'What is a cataract?').\n- **Bullet points:** Use a dash or hyphen (-) to start items in a list.\n- **Paragraphs:** Keep paragraphs short. Start a new paragraph when the topic shifts.\n- **White space:** Ensure there are blank lines between paragraphs and headings to separate elements.\n\n**PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS:**\n{{ $('Get Metrics First Draft').last().json.evaluation}}\n\n### TASK\n\n**STEP 1: CRITICAL CHECKS (Must Pass)**\n1. **Completeness:** Verify all required sections are present (Title, Key Messages, Background/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency)\n2. **Title & Subheadings Format:** Confirm the main title AND all section subheadings are phrased as questions (e.g., \"What are the benefits and risks of...\", \"How up to date is this review?\")\n3. **Factual Accuracy:** Check that all numbers, findings, and key messages match SOURCE_OF_TRUTH and ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT\n4. **Word Count:** Confirm total is under 850 words\n\n**STEP 2: IDENTIFY SPECIFIC CLARITY ISSUES**\nRead the DRAFT_TEXT as a patient would. Identify the 3-5 most important issues that would confuse or frustrate readers:\n\n**Priority 1 - Critical Clarity Issues:**\n- Unexplained jargon or technical terms without definitions\n- Sentences longer than 30 words that are hard to follow\n- Missing context that leaves readers confused\n- Contradictory or unclear statements\n\n**Priority 2 - Style Issues:**\n- Excessive passive voice that obscures who did what\n- Wordy phrases that could be simplified\n- Noun-heavy sentences that should use more verbs\n- Numbers written as words instead of numerals\n\n**Priority 3 - Structure Issues:**\n- Missing paragraph breaks that create walls of text\n- Bullet points not using dashes (–)\n- Missing blank lines between paragraphs and headings\n\nFor EACH issue you identify:\n- QUOTE the problematic sentence/phrase from the draft\n- EXPLAIN why it's problematic for readers\n- SUGGEST a concrete rewrite\n\n**STEP 3: USE METRICS AS SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**\nReview the PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS. Use them to:\n- Confirm your editorial instincts (e.g., \"I noticed many passive sentences; metrics show 27 instances\")\n- Identify patterns you might have missed\n- Provide context for your suggestions\n\nDO NOT simply list metric violations. Metrics are tools to support your editorial judgment, not the primary evaluation criteria.\n\n**STEP 4: FORMULATE JUDGMENT**\n\n**APPROVED if:**\n- All critical checks pass (complete, accurate, under 850 words)\n- No major clarity issues that would confuse readers\n- Minor style issues are acceptable if they don't harm understanding\n\n**NOT_APPROVED if:**\n- Any critical check fails (incomplete, inaccurate, too long)\n- OR 3+ significant clarity issues that would confuse readers\n- OR patterns of style problems that consistently reduce readability\n\n**For NOT_APPROVED, provide:**\n1. **Critical Issues (if any):** Missing sections, factual errors, length problems\n2. **Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:** Each with:\n   - Specific quote from the draft\n   - Why it's problematic\n   - Suggested rewrite\n3. **Supporting Evidence:** Brief mention of relevant metrics (e.g., \"The draft has 27 passive constructions, which contributes to the clarity issues noted above\")\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nYour response MUST be a single JSON object:\n{\n\"grade\": \"APPROVED\" | \"NOT_APPROVED\",\n\"feedback\": \"A single string summarizing all violations and deviations from typical PLS patterns, or an empty string if approved.\",\n\"pls_evaluation_summary\": \"Brief interpretation of the PLS evaluation results including percentile ranges and metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns\"\n}\n",

          "systemMessage": "=You are a \"Cochrane Plain Language Summary Editor\". You are an expert editor who helps writers improve their Plain Language Summaries by providing specific, actionable feedback based on Cochrane guidelines.\n\nYour role is to be a HELPFUL EDITOR, not a metrics police:\n\n- Focus on clarity and readability for patients, not just numbers\n- Quote specific problematic sentences from the draft\n- Suggest concrete rewrites that the writer can use immediately\n- Prioritize issues by impact on reader understanding\n- Recognize when technical complexity is justified\n- Limit feedback to the 3-5 most important improvements\n\nYour process:\n\n1. Check factual accuracy and completeness against source material\n2. Identify specific clarity and style issues in the draft text\n3. Use linguistic metrics as supporting evidence, not primary criteria\n4. Provide concrete, actionable suggestions with examples from the text\n\n## PLS EVALUATION API INTERPRETATION GUIDE:\n\nThe PLS evaluation API returns a comprehensive evaluation with three sections:\n\n**1. WORD COUNT STATUS:** Shows if text is within 850-word PLS limit\n**2. METRIC EVALUATION:** All metrics with percentile-based ratings and direction indicators\n**3. IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:** Specific numerical targets for metrics needing attention\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERCENTILE RATINGS:**\nThese ratings represent statistical conformity with typical PLS patterns from our corpus, NOT absolute quality measures.\n\n**For metrics where LOWER values are better (marked with ↓):**\n\n- **P25:** Text falls within the best 25% of corpus (below 25th percentile)\n- **P50:** Text is in the median range (25th-50th percentile)\n- **P75:** Text is in the 50th-75th percentile range\n- **P90:** Text is in the 75th-90th percentile range\n- **BEYOND_P90:** Text deviates significantly from typical patterns (beyond 90th percentile)\n\n**For metrics where HIGHER values are better (marked with ↑):**\n\n- **P75:** Text falls within the best 25% of corpus (above 75th percentile)\n- **P50:** Text is in the median range (50th-75th percentile)\n- **P25:** Text is in the 25th-50th percentile range\n- **P10:** Text is in the 10th-25th percentile range\n- **BELOW_P10:** Text deviates significantly from typical patterns (below 10th percentile)\n\nDeviation from typical patterns (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10/BELOW_P10) suggests review is warranted but does NOT automatically indicate poor quality—it may reflect legitimate stylistic choices or specific content requirements.\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE METRICS:**\n\n**READABILITY INDICES:**\n\n- **flesch_reading_ease** (↑): Score from 0-100 measuring text difficulty. Higher scores indicate easier text. Typical PLS range: 32-48\n- **flesch_kincaid_grade** (↓): U.S. grade level needed to understand the text. Typical PLS range: 11-16\n- **gunning_fog_index** (↓): Years of formal education needed. Typical PLS range: 16-21\n- **smog_index** (↓): Grade level based on polysyllabic words. Typical PLS range: 10-15\n- **dale_chall_readability** (↓): Score based on familiar word usage. Typical PLS range: 7-9\n- **coleman_liau_index** (↓): Grade level based on characters per word. Typical PLS range: 11-15\n- **automated_readability_index** (↓): Grade level from character and word counts. Typical PLS range: 12-17\n- **lix** (↓): Readability score based on long words. Typical PLS range: 50-62\n- **rix** (↓): Long word density measure. Typical PLS range: 6-9\n\n**SENTENCE STRUCTURE:**\n\n- **words_per_sentence** (↓): Average sentence length. Typical PLS range: 19-28 words\n- **passive_voice** (↓): Count of passive voice constructions. Typical PLS range: 9-23 instances\n- **active_voice** (↑): Count of active voice constructions. Typical PLS range: 20-41 instances\n\n**VOCABULARY COMPLEXITY:**\n\n- **complex_words_dc** (↓): Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. Typical PLS range: 115-277 words\n- **complex_words** (↓): Words with 3+ syllables. Typical PLS range: 60-145 words\n- **long_words** (↓): Words with 7+ characters. Typical PLS range: 88-208 words\n- **nominalization** (↓): Noun-form verbs count. Typical PLS range: 8-27 instances\n\n**PLAIN LANGUAGE ELEMENTS:**\n\n- **pronouns** (↑): Personal pronoun usage. Typical PLS range: 8-21 instances\n- **nouns** (↓): Total noun count. Typical PLS range: 83-202 nouns\n\n**Direction Indicators:**\n\n- (↑) = Higher values are more typical of PLS texts\n- (↓) = Lower values are more typical of PLS texts\n\n**NOTE:** These metrics help identify conformity with typical PLS patterns. Deviation from typical ranges may be acceptable depending on content and context.\n\n**HOW TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON METRIC DEVIATIONS:**\n\nWhen metrics fall outside typical ranges, suggest these specific actions to the writer:\n\n**For Readability Indices showing high complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n\n- **High FKGL/ARI/CLI:** \"Reduce sentence length (aim for 15-20 words) and use shorter words (1-2 syllables)\"\n- **High GFI/SMOG:** \"Replace complex words (3+ syllables) with simpler alternatives\"\n- **Low FRE:** \"Shorten both sentences and words to improve readability\"\n- **High LIX/RIX:** \"Replace long words (7+ letters) with shorter equivalents\"\n- **High DCRS:** \"Use more common, everyday vocabulary from the Dale-Chall familiar word list\"\n\n**For Structural Issues (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10/BELOW_P10):**\n\n- **High words_per_sentence:** \"Break long sentences into shorter ones. Target 15-20 words per sentence\"\n- **High passive_voice:** \"Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., 'Researchers found' not 'It was found')\"\n- **Low active_voice:** \"Start more sentences with the subject performing the action\"\n\n**For Vocabulary Complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n\n- **High complex_words:** \"Replace technical terms with everyday language where possible\"\n- **High long_words:** \"Choose shorter synonyms (e.g., 'use' instead of 'utilize')\"\n- **High nominalization:** \"Use verbs instead of noun forms (e.g., 'decide' not 'make a decision')\"\n\n**For Plain Language Elements (P10/BELOW_P10 or P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n\n- **Low pronouns:** \"Use 'we' and 'our' when referring to the research team\"\n- **High nouns:** \"Balance noun-heavy text with more action verbs\"\n\nRemember: The goal is conformity with typical PLS patterns, not extreme optimization. Moderate adjustments are often sufficient."

Title:\n   {{ $('Plain Titles Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n2. Key messages:\n   {{ $('Key messages Agent').last().json.output.key_messages.toJsonString()}}\n3. Introduction/Aims:\n   {{ $('Background Writer Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n4. Methods:\n   {{ $('Methods Summarizer Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n5.

Currency:\n   {{ $('Date Extraction Agent').last().json.output.toJsonString()}}\n\n**MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE:**\n**5.2 Style**\n\n- **Conciseness:** Be concise. Replace 'wordy' phrases (e.g., 'during the course of' with 'during'; 'due to the fact that' with 'because').\n- **Active Voice:** Use active voice (e.g., 'We compared the results') not passive voice (e.g., 'The results of the studies were compared').\n- **Pronouns:** Use first-person plural ('we', 'our') for review authors.\n- **Verbs:** Use direct verbs (e.g., 'the students investigated' not 'the students conducted an investigation').\n- **Numerals:** Write numbers as numerals (1, 2, 3) not words, unless starting a sentence.\n\n**5.3 Structure**\n\n- **Subheadings:** Use subheadings to guide the reader. Phrase subheadings as questions where possible (e.g., 'What is a cataract?').\n- **Bullet points:** Use a dash or hyphen (-) to start items in a list.\n- **Paragraphs:** Keep paragraphs short. Start a new paragraph when the topic shifts.\n- **White space:** Ensure there are blank lines between paragraphs and headings to separate elements.\n\n**PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS:**\n{{ $('Get Metrics Last Draft').last().json.evaluation}}\n\n### TASK\n\n**STEP 1: CRITICAL CHECKS (Must Pass)**\n1. **Completeness:** Verify all required sections are present (Title, Key Messages, Background/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency)\n2. **Title & Subheadings Format:** Confirm the main title AND all section subheadings are phrased as questions (e.g., \"What are the benefits and risks of...\", \"How up to date is this review?\")\n3. **Factual Accuracy:** Check that all numbers, findings, and key messages match SOURCE_OF_TRUTH and ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT\n4. **Word Count:** Confirm total is under 850 words\n\n**STEP 2: IDENTIFY SPECIFIC CLARITY ISSUES**\nRead the DRAFT_TEXT as a patient would. Identify the 3-5 most important issues that would confuse or frustrate readers:\n\n**Priority 1 - Critical Clarity Issues:**\n- Unexplained jargon or technical terms without definitions\n- Sentences longer than 30 words that are hard to follow\n- Missing context that leaves readers confused\n- Contradictory or unclear statements\n\n**Priority 2 - Style Issues:**\n- Excessive passive voice that obscures who did what\n- Wordy phrases that could be simplified\n- Noun-heavy sentences that should use more verbs\n- Numbers written as words instead of numerals\n\n**Priority 3 - Structure Issues:**\n- Missing paragraph breaks that create walls of text\n- Bullet points not using dashes (–)\n- Missing blank lines between paragraphs and headings\n\nFor EACH issue you identify:\n- QUOTE the problematic sentence/phrase from the draft\n- EXPLAIN why it's problematic for readers\n- SUGGEST a concrete rewrite\n\n**STEP 3: USE METRICS AS SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**\nReview the PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS. Use them to:\n- Confirm your editorial instincts (e.g., \"I noticed many passive sentences; metrics show 27 instances\")\n- Identify patterns you might have missed\n- Provide context for your suggestions\n\nDO NOT simply list metric violations. Metrics are tools to support your editorial judgment, not the primary evaluation criteria.\n\n**STEP 4: FORMULATE JUDGMENT**\n\n**APPROVED if:**\n- All critical checks pass (complete, accurate, under 850 words)\n- No major clarity issues that would confuse readers\n- Minor style issues are acceptable if they don't harm understanding\n\n**NOT_APPROVED if:**\n- Any critical check fails (incomplete, inaccurate, too long)\n- OR 3+ significant clarity issues that would confuse readers\n- OR patterns of style problems that consistently reduce readability\n\n**For NOT_APPROVED, provide:**\n1. **Critical Issues (if any):** Missing sections, factual errors, length problems\n2. **Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:** Each with:\n   - Specific quote from the draft\n   - Why it's problematic\n   - Suggested rewrite\n3. **Supporting Evidence:** Brief mention of relevant metrics (e.g., \"The draft has 27 passive constructions, which contributes to the clarity issues noted above\")\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nYour response MUST be a single JSON object:\n{\n\"grade\": \"APPROVED\" | \"NOT_APPROVED\",\n\"feedback\": \"A single string summarizing all violations and deviations from typical PLS patterns, or an empty string if approved.\",\n\"pls_evaluation_summary\": \"Brief interpretation of the PLS evaluation results including percentile ranges and metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns\"\n}\n",

          "systemMessage": "=You are a \"Cochrane Plain Language Summary Editor\". You are an expert editor who helps writers improve their Plain Language Summaries by providing specific, actionable feedback based on Cochrane guidelines.\n\nYour role is to be a HELPFUL EDITOR, not a metrics police:\n\n- Focus on clarity and readability for patients, not just numbers\n- Quote specific problematic sentences from the draft\n- Suggest concrete rewrites that the writer can use immediately\n- Prioritize issues by impact on reader understanding\n- Recognize when technical complexity is justified\n- Limit feedback to the 3-5 most important improvements\n\nYour process:\n\n1. Check factual accuracy and completeness against source material\n2. Identify specific clarity and style issues in the draft text\n3. Use linguistic metrics as supporting evidence, not primary criteria\n4. Provide concrete, actionable suggestions with examples from the text\n\n## PLS EVALUATION API INTERPRETATION GUIDE:\n\nThe PLS evaluation API returns a comprehensive evaluation with three sections:\n\n**1. WORD COUNT STATUS:** Shows if text is within 850-word PLS limit\n**2. METRIC EVALUATION:** All metrics with percentile-based ratings and direction indicators\n**3. IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:** Specific numerical targets for metrics needing attention\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERCENTILE RATINGS:**\nThese ratings represent statistical conformity with typical PLS patterns from our corpus, NOT absolute quality measures.\n\n**For metrics where LOWER values are better (marked with ↓):**\n\n- **P25:** Text falls within the best 25% of corpus (below 25th percentile)\n- **P50:** Text is in the median range (25th-50th percentile)\n- **P75:** Text is in the 50th-75th percentile range\n- **P90:** Text is in the 75th-90th percentile range\n- **BEYOND_P90:** Text deviates significantly from typical patterns (beyond 90th percentile)\n\n**For metrics where HIGHER values are better (marked with ↑):**\n\n- **P75:** Text falls within the best 25% of corpus (above 75th percentile)\n- **P50:** Text is in the median range (50th-75th percentile)\n- **P25:** Text is in the 25th-50th percentile range\n- **P10:** Text is in the 10th-25th percentile range\n- **BELOW_P10:** Text deviates significantly from typical patterns (below 10th percentile)\n\nDeviation from typical patterns (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10/BELOW_P10) suggests review is warranted but does NOT automatically indicate poor quality—it may reflect legitimate stylistic choices or specific content requirements.\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE METRICS:**\n\n**READABILITY INDICES:**\n\n- **flesch_reading_ease** (↑): Score from 0-100 measuring text difficulty. Higher scores indicate easier text. Typical PLS range: 32-48\n- **flesch_kincaid_grade** (↓): U.S. grade level needed to understand the text. Typical PLS range: 11-16\n- **gunning_fog_index** (↓): Years of formal education needed. Typical PLS range: 16-21\n- **smog_index** (↓): Grade level based on polysyllabic words. Typical PLS range: 10-15\n- **dale_chall_readability** (↓): Score based on familiar word usage. Typical PLS range: 7-9\n- **coleman_liau_index** (↓): Grade level based on characters per word. Typical PLS range: 11-15\n- **automated_readability_index** (↓): Grade level from character and word counts. Typical PLS range: 12-17\n- **lix** (↓): Readability score based on long words. Typical PLS range: 50-62\n- **rix** (↓): Long word density measure. Typical PLS range: 6-9\n\n**SENTENCE STRUCTURE:**\n\n- **words_per_sentence** (↓): Average sentence length. Typical PLS range: 19-28 words\n- **passive_voice** (↓): Count of passive voice constructions. Typical PLS range: 9-23 instances\n- **active_voice** (↑): Count of active voice constructions. Typical PLS range: 20-41 instances\n\n**VOCABULARY COMPLEXITY:**\n\n- **complex_words_dc** (↓): Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. Typical PLS range: 115-277 words\n- **complex_words** (↓): Words with 3+ syllables. Typical PLS range: 60-145 words\n- **long_words** (↓): Words with 7+ characters. Typical PLS range: 88-208 words\n- **nominalization** (↓): Noun-form verbs count. Typical PLS range: 8-27 instances\n\n**PLAIN LANGUAGE ELEMENTS:**\n\n- **pronouns** (↑): Personal pronoun usage. Typical PLS range: 8-21 instances\n- **nouns** (↓): Total noun count. Typical PLS range: 83-202 nouns\n\n**Direction Indicators:**\n\n- (↑) = Higher values are more typical of PLS texts\n- (↓) = Lower values are more typical of PLS texts\n\n**NOTE:** These metrics help identify conformity with typical PLS patterns. Deviation from typical ranges may be acceptable depending on content and context.\n\n**HOW TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON METRIC DEVIATIONS:**\n\nWhen metrics fall outside typical ranges, suggest these specific actions to the writer:\n\n**For Readability Indices showing high complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n\n- **High FKGL/ARI/CLI:** \"Reduce sentence length (aim for 15-20 words) and use shorter words (1-2 syllables)\"\n- **High GFI/SMOG:** \"Replace complex words (3+ syllables) with simpler alternatives\"\n- **Low FRE:** \"Shorten both sentences and words to improve readability\"\n- **High LIX/RIX:** \"Replace long words (7+ letters) with shorter equivalents\"\n- **High DCRS:** \"Use more common, everyday vocabulary from the Dale-Chall familiar word list\"\n\n**For Structural Issues (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10/BELOW_P10):**\n\n- **High words_per_sentence:** \"Break long sentences into shorter ones. Target 15-20 words per sentence\"\n- **High passive_voice:** \"Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., 'Researchers found' not 'It was found')\"\n- **Low active_voice:** \"Start more sentences with the subject performing the action\"\n\n**For Vocabulary Complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n\n- **High complex_words:** \"Replace technical terms with everyday language where possible\"\n- **High long_words:** \"Choose shorter synonyms (e.g., 'use' instead of 'utilize')\"\n- **High nominalization:** \"Use verbs instead of noun forms (e.g., 'decide' not 'make a decision')\"\n\n**For Plain Language Elements (P10/BELOW_P10 or P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n\n- **Low pronouns:** \"Use 'we' and 'our' when referring to the research team\"\n- **High nouns:** \"Balance noun-heavy text with more action verbs\"\n\nRemember: The goal is conformity with typical PLS patterns, not extreme optimization. Moderate adjustments are often sufficient."

Explain all complex medical terms in parentheses immediately after first use.\n- **Style:** Use active voice. Keep sentences short (average 20 words). Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences). Use first-person plural ('we'). Use numerals for numbers (e.g., 3, not 'three').\n- **Structure:** The document must be structured logically with a Title, Key messages (2-3 points), and sections with clear, question-based subheadings. Use dashes (–) for lists.\n- **Constraints:** The final summary must be under 850 words. Do not add or invent information; only use what is in the original source material.\n\n### TASK ###\nYour mission is to produce a final, polished Plain Language Summary by revising the PREVIOUS_DRAFT based on the EVALUATOR_FEEDBACK. You will achieve this through an iterative editing and validation process.\n\n**STEP 1: Analyze the Feedback**\n- Read the EVALUATOR_FEEDBACK carefully.\n- Identify all specific issues mentioned (e.g., passive voice, long sentences, unexplained jargon, factual errors, missing information).\n- Prioritize issues that impact accuracy and clarity.\n\n**STEP 2: Initial Comprehensive Edit**\n- Based on the EVALUATOR_FEEDBACK, perform a complete revision of the PREVIOUS_DRAFT.\n- Fix ALL specific issues mentioned in the feedback:\n  - **Accuracy Issues:** Correct any factual errors or misrepresentations.\n  - **Style Issues:** Rewrite sentences to use active voice, break up long sentences, shorten paragraphs.\n  - **Clarity Issues:** Add explanations for medical terms, simplify complex language, improve flow.\n  - **Formatting Issues:** Fix subheading format, list formatting, number representation.\n  - **Structure Issues:** Reorganize sections if needed, ensure logical flow.\n- Apply all rules from the STYLE_GUIDE.\n- Ensure the text remains scientifically accurate.\n- This creates your revised version (`draft_v1`).\n\n**STEP 3: Validation Loop**\n- **Re-evaluate your revised draft** against the EVALUATOR_FEEDBACK:\n  - Check that each issue mentioned in the feedback has been addressed.\n  - Verify the draft follows all STYLE_GUIDE rules.\n  - Ensure word count is under 850 words.\n  - Confirm all medical terms are explained.\n  - Verify active voice is used consistently.\n  - Check sentence length (aim for 15-20 words average).\n\n- **If any issues remain unfixed:**\n  - Edit your current draft to address the remaining problems.\n  - This creates a new version of your draft.\n  - Return to the beginning of STEP 3 and re-evaluate.\n\n- **If all issues are resolved:**\n  - The current draft is ready for final output.\n\n**STEP 4: Final Quality Check**\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n- All feedback points have been addressed\n- No new errors were introduced during editing\n- The summary remains factually accurate\n- All complex terms are explained\n- Sentences are concise and clear\n- Active voice is used throughout\n- Word count is under 850 words\n- The tone is conversational and accessible\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\nYour response must be ONLY the final, validated, and fully compliant Plain Language Summary as a single block of plain text.

            "title": "Multimodal interventions for cachexia management",
            "abstract": "Background\nCachexia (disease‐related wasting) is a complex metabolic syndrome which occurs in people with chronic illnesses, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia experience unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. Multimodal interventions which work synergistically to treat the syndrome could lead to benefits.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions aimed at alleviating or stabilising cachexia in people with a chronic illness.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in July 2024, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify studies.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with or at risk of cachexia, comparing multimodal interventions combining two or more modalities (of pharmacology, nutrition, exercise) to treatment as usual, variation of the intervention, or unimodal intervention.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened potentially eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (RoB 1). Primary outcomes were physical function, strength, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were body composition and weight, quality of life (QoL), appetite, fatigue, and biochemical markers. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.\n\nMain results\nWe included nine studies with 926 adults (mean age: 63 years). Study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants. Six studies were conducted in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. There were six studies in people with cancer, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. We judged four studies to be at an overall high risk of bias, and five at an overall unclear risk. All outcomes in all comparisons had very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and/or indirectness and twice for imprecision.\nMultimodal intervention (pharmacological, nutritional, and/or exercise) compared to treatment as usual\nOne cancer study randomised 46 participants, with 41 included in all analyses except adverse events. The study assessed outcomes immediately after treatment, lasting six weeks. Compared to treatment as usual, there is no clear evidence for an effect of a multimodal intervention on: physical function (mean difference (MD) −16.10 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) −79.06 to 46.86; 41 participants); strength (MD 3.80 kg, 95% CI −3.21 to 10.81; 41 participants); adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.65; 46 participants); body composition (MD 7.89 cm2, 95% CI −10.43 to 26.21; 41 participants); weight (MD 5.89 kg, 95% CI −1.45 to 13.23; 41 participants); appetite (MD 0.68 points, 95% CI −0.60 to 1.96; 41 participants); fatigue (MD 0.12, 95% CI −1.05 to 1.29; 41 participants); and biochemical markers (MD 2%, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.01; 41 participants), but the evidence was very uncertain; QoL was not reported.\nMultimodal intervention compared to variation of the intervention\nThree cancer studies and one HIV/AIDS study randomised 192 participants. We could not use the available data, nor obtain additional data, from two studies (one in cancer, one in HIV/AIDS). The studies assessed outcomes immediately after treatment, ranging from three to seven months. Compared to a variation of the intervention, there is no clear evidence for an effect of a multimodal intervention on: physical function (MD 10.0 m, 95% CI −36.27 to 56.27; 1 study, 56 participants); strength (MD 0.7 kg, 95% CI −3.75 to 5.15; 1 study, 56 participants); adverse events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.02; P = 0.75, I2= 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); body composition (MD −2.67 kg, 95% CI −5.89 to 0.54; P = 0.10, I2= 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); weight (MD −2.47 kg, 95% CI −7.11 to 2.16; P = 0.30, I2= 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); QoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.15, 95% CI −0.55 to 0.26; P = 0.47, I2= 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); appetite (SMD −0.34, 95% CI −1.27 to 0.59; P = 0.48, I2= 79%; 2 studies, 95 participants); fatigue (MD 6.40 points, 95% CI −1.10 to 13.90; 1 study, 56 participants); or biochemical markers (MD 9.80 pg/mL, 95% CI −6.25 to 25.85; P = 0.23, I2= 73%; 2 studies, 95 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain.\nMultimodal intervention compared to unimodal intervention\nWe included six studies (802 participants) in this comparison: three cancer studies, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The studies assessed outcomes immediately after treatment, ranging from three to seven months. We could not use the available data, nor obtain additional data, from the HIV/AIDS study. Compared to a unimodal intervention, there is no clear evidence for an effect of a multimodal intervention on: physical function (SMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.22 to 0.26; P = 0.86, I2= 0%; 2 studies, 348 participants); strength (SMD 0.23, 95% CI −0.81 to 1.27; P = 0.66, I2= 0%; 2 studies, 348 participants); adverse events (RR 0.87, 95% CI −0.43 to 1.73; P = 0.68, I2= 45%; 2 studies, 395 participants); body composition (SMD 0.11, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.50; P = 0.58, I2= 74%; 5 studies, 742 participants); body weight (SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.33; P = 0.90, I2= 49%; 4 studies, 431 participants); QoL (SMD 0.22, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.73; P = 0.39, I2= 61%; 3 studies, 411 participants); appetite (SMD −0.09, 95% CI −0.58 to 0.40; P = 0.72, I2= 58%; 2 studies, 395 participants); fatigue (MD −6.80 points, 95% CI −12.44 to −1.17; 1 study, 244 participants); and biochemical markers (SMD 0.11, 95% CI −0.59 to 0.80; P = 0.76, I2= 79%; 3 studies, 411 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe review found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia. The certainty of the evidence was very low. Methodologically rigorous, well‐powered RCTs with adequate interaction times are needed to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia across chronic illnesses."

So each sentence: \"It is unclear if multimodal interventions affect physical function.\" etc.\n\nWe must not use numbers or technical jargon. Avoid \"very low certainty\". Use plain language.

          "output": "Are combined treatments (medication, nutrition, and exercise) helpful for managing cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\n**Key messages**\n- The available studies do not provide clear evidence that multimodal interventions (combined medication, nutrition, and exercise programmes) improve outcomes such as physical function (ability to move and perform daily activities), strength, weight, or quality of life for people with cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss), and the overall certainty of the evidence is uncertain.\n- Data on adverse events (unwanted side effects) from these combined programmes are sparse, and the studies did not show a consistent pattern of harm.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up periods to determine whether multimodal approaches can safely and effectively manage cachexia across different chronic illnesses.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that often develops in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It causes unintentional loss of body weight and muscle, a loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, and a poorer quality of life. Because the body’s metabolism is disturbed, simply eating more does not usually reverse the problem, and the loss of muscle can make it harder for patients to tolerate other treatments.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions for cachexia?\nDoctors and researchers have tried different ways to treat cachexia, including medicines (pharmacological), special nutrition plans, and exercise programmes. A \"multimodal\" approach means combining two or more of these strategies at the same time, hoping that they will work together (synergistically) to improve strength, weight, and overall wellbeing. For example, a patient might receive a drug to reduce inflammation, a high‑protein diet, and a supervised exercise routine all together.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether these combined (multimodal) treatments actually help people with cachexia. Specifically, they looked at randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the multimodal programme or a usual care or single‑treatment approach – to see if the combined interventions improve physical function, muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, and the presence of any harmful side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that evaluated multimodal interventions for cachexia in adults, combined their results on outcomes such as physical function, weight and quality of life, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at nine randomised controlled trials that together included 926 adults (average age 63) who had cachexia or were at risk of it. The studies covered people with cancer (six trials), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants and the trials were mainly carried out in Europe, with additional work in Turkey, New Zealand and the United States. The interventions lasted from six weeks up to seven months and all combined two or more approaches – such as medicines, nutritional support and exercise – compared with usual care, a different multimodal programme, or a single‑component treatment. The review did not report funding sources, gender breakdowns or detailed severity of cachexia. It is unclear whether these multimodal programmes improve physical function, muscle strength, body composition, body weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, biochemical markers, or the number of side‑effects or adverse events.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search."

          "draft": "Are combined treatments (medication, nutrition, and exercise) helpful for managing cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\n**Key messages**\n- The available studies do not provide clear evidence that multimodal interventions (combined medication, nutrition, and exercise programmes) improve outcomes such as physical function (ability to move and perform daily activities), strength, weight, or quality of life for people with cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss), and the overall certainty of the evidence is uncertain.\n- Data on adverse events (unwanted side effects) from these combined programmes are sparse, and the studies did not show a consistent pattern of harm.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up periods to determine whether multimodal approaches can safely and effectively manage cachexia across different chronic illnesses.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that often develops in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It causes unintentional loss of body weight and muscle, a loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, and a poorer quality of life. Because the body’s metabolism is disturbed, simply eating more does not usually reverse the problem, and the loss of muscle can make it harder for patients to tolerate other treatments.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions for cachexia?\nDoctors and researchers have tried different ways to treat cachexia, including medicines (pharmacological), special nutrition plans, and exercise programmes. A \"multimodal\" approach means combining two or more of these strategies at the same time, hoping that they will work together (synergistically) to improve strength, weight, and overall wellbeing. For example, a patient might receive a drug to reduce inflammation, a high‑protein diet, and a supervised exercise routine all together.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether these combined (multimodal) treatments actually help people with cachexia. Specifically, they looked at randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the multimodal programme or a usual care or single‑treatment approach – to see if the combined interventions improve physical function, muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, and the presence of any harmful side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that evaluated multimodal interventions for cachexia in adults, combined their results on outcomes such as physical function, weight and quality of life, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at nine randomised controlled trials that together included 926 adults (average age 63) who had cachexia or were at risk of it. The studies covered people with cancer (six trials), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants and the trials were mainly carried out in Europe, with additional work in Turkey, New Zealand and the United States. The interventions lasted from six weeks up to seven months and all combined two or more approaches – such as medicines, nutritional support and exercise – compared with usual care, a different multimodal programme, or a single‑component treatment. The review did not report funding sources, gender breakdowns or detailed severity of cachexia. It is unclear whether these multimodal programmes improve physical function, muscle strength, body composition, body weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, biochemical markers, or the number of side‑effects or adverse events.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

              "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the required subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide and makes navigation harder for readers. In addition, the text contains several clarity and readability problems:\n1. **Passive‑voice heavy** – \"The review did not report funding sources, gender breakdowns or detailed severity of cachexia.\" (Passive) → rewrite as \"We did not report funding sources, gender breakdowns, or detailed severity of cachexia.\"\n2. **Long, noun‑heavy sentences** – \"The interventions lasted from six weeks up to seven months and all combined two or more approaches – such as medicines, nutritional support and exercise – compared with usual care, a different multimodal programme, or a single‑component treatment.\" (28 words, many nouns) → rewrite as \"The interventions lasted 6 weeks to 7 months and combined at least two approaches—medicines, nutrition, or exercise—against usual care, another multimodal programme, or a single‑component treatment.\"\n3. **Excessive nominalisation** – phrases like \"the presence of any harmful side effects\" and \"the overall certainty of the evidence is uncertain\" make the text dense. Use verbs: \"we looked for harmful side effects\" and \"we are uncertain about the evidence quality.\"\n4. **Jargon without definition** – the term \"synergistically\" appears in the background but is not explained for a lay audience. Replace with \"working together to give a bigger benefit.\"\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – change each heading to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"What did we aim to find out?\", \"How did we search for studies?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\nThese changes will also address the metric deviations: the draft shows high nominalisation (25 instances, beyond the typical range), a very high noun count (202, beyond P90), and elevated lexical complexity (SMOG 15.2, complex words 162). Reducing nominalisations, shortening sentences, and using more active verbs will lower these scores and improve readability.\nOverall, the draft needs revised subheadings, more active and concise language, and simpler wording to meet the style guide and improve patient‑friendly clarity.",
              "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (659 words) but deviates on several readability metrics: nominalisation (25, beyond P90), nouns (202, beyond P90), LIX (59.6, beyond P90), RIX (8.5, beyond P90), SMOG (15.2, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall (8.6, beyond P90), complex words (162, beyond P90) and long words (238, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and lexically complex than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."

Must include Title, Key messages (2-3 points), and sections with question-based subheadings: \"What are the key messages?\" The style guide: use question-based subheadings. Use first-person plural. Use active voice. Use short sentences, average 15-20 words. Under 850 words.\n\nWe need to incorporate content from source. Ensure we explain terms: cachexia (disease-related wasting) etc. Avoid passive voice. Use numbers as numerals.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nTitle: Are combined treatments (medication, nutrition, and exercise) helpful for managing cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nKey messages: 2-3 bullet points (use dash). Must be question heading: \"What are the key messages?\" Then bullet points.\n\nSections: Introduction/Aims -> question heading: \"What is cachexia and why does it matter?\" and \"What are multimodal interventions for cachexia?\" and \"What did we aim to find out?\" Could combine but keep separate.\n\nMethods: \"How did we search for and select studies?\" (question heading)\n\nResults: \"What did we find?\" (question heading)\n\nLimitations: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" (question heading)\n\nCurrency: \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" (question heading)\n\nMake sure active voice, short sentences.\n\nLet's draft.\n\nWord count estimate: likely ~600 words.\n\nProceed.\n\nassistantfinalAre combined treatments (medication, nutrition, and exercise) helpful for managing cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- The nine trials we found do not show clear benefits of combined medication, nutrition and exercise programmes for physical function, strength, weight, or quality of life in people with cachexia, and the certainty of the evidence is very low.  \n- Reports of unwanted side effects are few and do not reveal a consistent pattern of harm.  \n- Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether multimodal approaches can safely and effectively manage cachexia across different chronic illnesses.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious syndrome that often develops in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It causes unintentional loss of body weight and muscle, loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, and a poorer quality of life. Because metabolism is disturbed, simply eating more does not usually reverse the problem, and muscle loss can make other and future treatments harder to tolerate.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions for cachexia?\nResearchers have tried medicines (pharmacological), special nutrition plans, and exercise programmes to treat cachexia. A multimodal approach combines two or more of these strategies at the same time, hoping they will work together to give a bigger benefit for strength, weight and overall wellbeing. For example, a patient might receive an anti‑inflammatory drug, a high‑protein diet, and a supervised exercise routine together.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these combined (multimodal) treatments actually help people with cachexia. Specifically, we looked for randomised controlled trials that compared a multimodal programme with usual care, a different multimodal programme, or a single‑component treatment. We examined outcomes such as physical function, muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life and any harmful side effects.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trial registers in July 2024. We also checked reference lists, performed citation searching and contacted study authors. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results for physical function, weight and quality of life, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified nine randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 926 adults (average age 63) with cachexia or at risk of it. Six trials involved people with cancer; the others involved COPD, chronic kidney disease and HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants. Interventions lasted 6 weeks to 7 months and always combined at least two components—medicines, nutrition or exercise—against usual care, another multimodal programme, or a single‑component treatment. The studies did not report funding sources, gender breakdowns or detailed severity of cachexia. Across all outcomes—physical function, muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, biochemical markers and adverse events—we found no clear evidence of benefit, and the certainty of the evidence was very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are uncertain about the results because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and several studies did not provide data for all outcomes we were interested in. The overall risk of bias was high or unclear in most trials, and the evidence does not cover all patient groups, interventions or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to the July 2024 search date."
