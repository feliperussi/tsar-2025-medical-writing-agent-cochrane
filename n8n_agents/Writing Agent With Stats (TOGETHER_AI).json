It must include the most important findings on benefits and unwanted or harmful effects.\n    - If harmful effects were not reported, you MUST state that explicitly.\n    - If the review could not answer the question (e.g., no studies found), state this and the reason why.\n- **Second Key Message (Optional):** You may include a second message if there is another significant finding or important secondary objective to report.\n- **Final Key Message:** MUST state what should happen next.

We found only one study that had enrolled a large enough number of people to give reliable results.\"\n- \"Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering these medicines.\"\n\n**Topic: rapid tests for strep sore throat in children**\n- \"The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics.\"\n- \"The number of children receiving unnecessary antibiotics following a rapid test is still likely to be lower than the number of children who would receive unnecessary antibiotics if the test is not used.\"\n- \"Both types of rapid tests studied in the review had similar accuracy.\"\n\n**Topic: pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis**\n- \"After six months of treatment, medicines called 'biologics' seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin.\"\n- \"Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis.\"\n- \"More studies are needed that compare these types of medicines directly against each other.\"\n\n**Topic: interleukin-6 blocking agents for treating COVID-19**\n- \"Treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin-6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment.\"\n- \"Studies of other medicines that block interleukin-6 to treat COVID-19 are under way.

The part in [brackets] is optional and should only be included if the review is an update.\n\n`[This review updates our previous review.] The evidence is up to date to month and year of search.` The \"This review updates our previous review.\" goes if they mentioned any previous review or some update.\n\n### EXAMPLE ###\n- If a review's main analysis is based on searches up to \"August 2021\", but a later search in \"February 2024\" found studies that are still \"awaiting classification\", the correct date for the *current evidence* is **August 2021**.\n- The correct output would be: \"The evidence is up to date to August 2021 of search.\" (Potentially with the 'update' prefix).\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\nYour response must be ONLY a single JSON object with one key, \"evidence_currency_statement\".",

WORD COUNT STATUS:** Shows if text is within 850-word PLS limit\n**2. METRIC EVALUATION:** All metrics with percentile-based ratings and direction indicators\n**3. IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:** Specific numerical targets for metrics needing attention\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERCENTILE RATINGS:**\nThese ratings represent statistical conformity with typical PLS patterns from our corpus, NOT absolute quality measures.\n\n**For metrics where LOWER values are better (marked with ↓):**\n- **P25:** Text falls within the best 25% of corpus (below 25th percentile)\n- **P50:** Text is in the median range (25th-50th percentile)\n- **P75:** Text is in the 50th-75th percentile range\n- **P90:** Text is in the 75th-90th percentile range\n- **BEYOND_P90:** Text deviates significantly from typical patterns (beyond 90th percentile)\n\n**For metrics where HIGHER values are better (marked with ↑):**\n- **P75:** Text falls within the best 25% of corpus (above 75th percentile)\n- **P50:** Text is in the median range (50th-75th percentile)\n- **P25:** Text is in the 25th-50th percentile range\n- **P10:** Text is in the 10th-25th percentile range\n- **BELOW_P10:** Text deviates significantly from typical patterns (below 10th percentile)\n\nDeviation from typical patterns (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10/BELOW_P10) suggests review is warranted but does NOT automatically indicate poor quality—it may reflect legitimate stylistic choices or specific content requirements.\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE METRICS:**\n\n**READABILITY INDICES:**\n- **flesch_reading_ease** (↑): Score from 0-100 measuring text difficulty. Higher scores indicate easier text. Typical PLS range: 32-48\n- **flesch_kincaid_grade** (↓): U.S. grade level needed to understand the text. Typical PLS range: 11-16\n- **gunning_fog_index** (↓): Years of formal education needed. Typical PLS range: 16-21\n- **smog_index** (↓): Grade level based on polysyllabic words. Typical PLS range: 10-15\n- **dale_chall_readability** (↓): Score based on familiar word usage. Typical PLS range: 7-9\n- **coleman_liau_index** (↓): Grade level based on characters per word. Typical PLS range: 11-15\n- **automated_readability_index** (↓): Grade level from character and word counts. Typical PLS range: 12-17\n- **lix** (↓): Readability score based on long words. Typical PLS range: 50-62\n- **rix** (↓): Long word density measure. Typical PLS range: 6-9\n\n**SENTENCE STRUCTURE:**\n- **words_per_sentence** (↓): Average sentence length. Typical PLS range: 19-28 words\n- **passive_voice** (↓): Count of passive voice constructions. Typical PLS range: 9-23 instances\n- **active_voice** (↑): Count of active voice constructions. Typical PLS range: 20-41 instances\n\n**VOCABULARY COMPLEXITY:**\n- **complex_words_dc** (↓): Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. Typical PLS range: 115-277 words\n- **complex_words** (↓): Words with 3+ syllables. Typical PLS range: 60-145 words\n- **long_words** (↓): Words with 7+ characters. Typical PLS range: 88-208 words\n- **nominalization** (↓): Noun-form verbs count. Typical PLS range: 8-27 instances\n\n**PLAIN LANGUAGE ELEMENTS:**\n- **pronouns** (↑): Personal pronoun usage. Typical PLS range: 8-21 instances\n- **nouns** (↓): Total noun count. Typical PLS range: 83-202 nouns\n\n**Direction Indicators:**\n- (↑) = Higher values are more typical of PLS texts\n- (↓) = Lower values are more typical of PLS texts\n\n**NOTE:** These metrics help identify conformity with typical PLS patterns. Deviation from typical ranges may be acceptable depending on content and context.\n\n**HOW TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON METRIC DEVIATIONS:**\n\nWhen metrics fall outside typical ranges, suggest these specific actions to the writer:\n\n**For Readability Indices showing high complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n- **High FKGL/ARI/CLI:** \"Reduce sentence length (aim for 15-20 words) and use shorter words (1-2 syllables)\"\n- **High GFI/SMOG:** \"Replace complex words (3+ syllables) with simpler alternatives\"\n- **Low FRE:** \"Shorten both sentences and words to improve readability\"\n- **High LIX/RIX:** \"Replace long words (7+ letters) with shorter equivalents\"\n- **High DCRS:** \"Use more common, everyday vocabulary from the Dale-Chall familiar word list\"\n\n**For Structural Issues (P90/BEYOND_P90 or P10/BELOW_P10):**\n- **High words_per_sentence:** \"Break long sentences into shorter ones. Target 15-20 words per sentence\"\n- **High passive_voice:** \"Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., 'Researchers found' not 'It was found')\"\n- **Low active_voice:** \"Start more sentences with the subject performing the action\"\n\n**For Vocabulary Complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n- **High complex_words:** \"Replace technical terms with everyday language where possible\"\n- **High long_words:** \"Choose shorter synonyms (e.g., 'use' instead of 'utilize')\"\n- **High nominalization:** \"Use verbs instead of noun forms (e.g., 'decide' not 'make a decision')\"\n\n**For Plain Language Elements (P10/BELOW_P10 or P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n- **Low pronouns:** \"Use 'we' and 'our' when referring to the research team\"\n- **High nouns:** \"Balance noun-heavy text with more action verbs\"\n\nRemember: The goal is conformity with typical PLS patterns, not extreme optimization. Moderate adjustments are often sufficient."

Explain all complex terms from the DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT in parentheses.  \n- **Style:** Use active voice. Keep sentences short (avg. 20 words). Keep paragraphs short. Use first-person plural (“we”). Use numerals for numbers (e.g., 3, not “three”).  \n- **Structure:** The document must include a Title, 2–3 Key messages, and sections with clear, question-based subheadings. Use dashes (-) for lists.  \n- **Constraints:** The final summary must be under 850 words. Do not add or invent information; only use what is in the SOURCE_DATA.\n\n\n### TASK ###\nYou are the **Revision Editor**. Your mission is to apply the REVISION_FEEDBACK to the RAW_DRAFT_TEXT and deliver the final, compliant Plain Language Summary as a single block of text.\n\n**STEP 1: Read & Diagnose**  \n- Read the RAW_DRAFT_TEXT end-to-end.  \n- Read the REVISION_FEEDBACK carefully. If the feedback is JSON, prioritize keys such as “feedback”, “required_changes”, “issues”, and “suggested_edits”. If it is plain text, treat it as a list of actionable requirements.\n\n**STEP 2: Apply Feedback with Strict Priorities**  \nWhen feedback conflicts with other constraints, follow this priority order without stating it in the output:  \n1) **Factual accuracy** vs. SOURCE_DATA (never contradict or invent).  \n2) **No new information** beyond SOURCE_DATA.  \n3) **Word count ≤ 850**.  \n4) **STYLE_GUIDE** (active voice, short sentences/paragraphs, numerals, dashes for lists, question-based subheadings).  \n5) **Reviewer preferences** (apply as long as 1–4 remain satisfied).\n\n**STEP 3: Edit Pass**  \n- Implement all actionable feedback items that do not violate the priorities.  \n- Integrate plain-language explanations (from DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT) the first time complex terms appear, in parentheses.  \n- Enforce style: active voice, short sentences (≈20 words avg), short paragraphs, numerals for numbers.  \n- Improve flow and coherence while preserving meaning.  \n- Maintain the required document structure (Title, 2–3 Key messages, question-based subheadings, dashes for lists).\n\n**STEP 4: Final Consistency Check**  \n- Re-check each claim against SOURCE_DATA; remove or rephrase anything unsupported.  \n- Ensure the final text is ≤ 850 words and fully follows the STYLE_GUIDE.  \n- Do not include meta-notes, explanations, or the feedback itself in the output—only the polished summary.\n\n---\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\nReturn **only** the updated Plain Language Summary as a single block of plain text. Do not use Markdown or any additional formatting.\n",

Target 15-20 words per sentence\"\n- **High passive_voice:** \"Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., 'Researchers found' not 'It was found')\"\n- **Low active_voice:** \"Start more sentences with the subject performing the action\"\n\n**For Vocabulary Complexity (P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n- **High complex_words:** \"Replace technical terms with everyday language where possible\"\n- **High long_words:** \"Choose shorter synonyms (e.g., 'use' instead of 'utilize')\"\n- **High nominalization:** \"Use verbs instead of noun forms (e.g., 'decide' not 'make a decision')\"\n\n**For Plain Language Elements (P10/BELOW_P10 or P90/BEYOND_P90):**\n- **Low pronouns:** \"Use 'we' and 'our' when referring to the research team\"\n- **High nouns:** \"Balance noun-heavy text with more action verbs\"\n\nRemember: The goal is conformity with typical PLS patterns, not extreme optimization. Moderate adjustments are often sufficient."

It is considered a common cardiovascular condition with complex clinical management. The increasing prevalence and complexity in management underpin the need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. There is a need to systematically examine the optimal way in which clinical services are organised to deliver evidence‐based care for people with AF. Recommended approaches include collaborative, organised multidisciplinary, and virtual (or eHealth/mHealth) models of care.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of clinical service organisation for AF versus usual care for people with all types of AF.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to October 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP to April 2023. We applied no restrictions on date, publication status, or language.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published as full texts and as abstract only, involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of any type of AF. We included RCTs comparing organised clinical service, disease‐specific management interventions (including e‐health models of care) for people with AF that were multicomponent and multidisciplinary in nature to usual care.\n\nData collection and analysis\nThree review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random‐effects analyses. We then calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) using the RR. We performed sensitivity analyses by only including studies with a low risk of selection and attrition bias. We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE.\nThe primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, AF‐related emergency department visits, thromboembolic complications, minor cerebrovascular bleeding events, major cerebrovascular bleeding events, all bleeding events, AF‐related quality of life, AF symptom burden, cost of intervention, and length of hospital stay.\n\nMain results\nWe included 8 studies (8205 participants) of collaborative, multidisciplinary care, or virtual care for people with AF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse‐led multidisciplinary approach (n = 4) or management using mHealth (n = 2) compared to usual care. Only six out of the eight included studies could be included in the meta‐analysis (for all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, thromboembolic complications, and major bleeding), as quality of life was not assessed using a validated outcome measure specific for AF. We assessed the overall risk of bias as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias rating for performance bias (blinding) in particular.\nOrganised AF clinical services probably result in a large reduction in all‐cause mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; 5 studies, 4664 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 37) compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services probably make little to no difference to all‐cause hospitalisation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1340 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 2‐year NNTB 101) and may not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.19; 5 studies, 4564 participants; low certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 86) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; 3 studies, 3641 participants; high certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 28) compared to usual care.\nOrganised AF clinical services may have little to no effect on thromboembolic complications such as stroke (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.77; 5 studies, 4653 participants; low certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 588) and major cerebrovascular bleeding events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.97; 3 studies, 2964 participants; low certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 556). None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nModerate certainty evidence shows that organisation of clinical services for AF likely results in a large reduction in all‐cause mortality, but probably makes little to no difference to all‐cause hospitalisation compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events. None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events. Due to the limited number of studies, more research is required to compare different models of care organisation, including utilisation of mHealth. Appropriately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the importance of the co‐ordination of care underpinned by collaborative multidisciplinary approaches and augmented by virtual care."
