    test_text = """Rationale
Trauma systems have become the standard of care in high‚Äêincome countries, but remain uncommon in low‚Äê and middle‚Äêincome countries. High‚Äêquality evidence of effectiveness is needed to advocate for the development of trauma systems in low‚Äê and middle‚Äêincome countries, where the burden of injury is highest.

Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of organised trauma systems and designated trauma centres compared with usual care in injured patients.

Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 16 December 2023. We also searched grey literature, checked reference lists of included studies, and contacted the authors of relevant studies.

Eligibility criteria
We included randomised controlled trials, non‚Äêrandomised trials, controlled before‚Äêafter studies, and interrupted time series studies comparing organised trauma systems or designated trauma centres with usual care. We planned to include patients who had had major trauma (i.e. Injury Severity Score greater than 15), but made a post‚Äêhoc decision to include patients regardless of injury severity. Studies were considered for inclusion regardless of date, language, or publication status.

Outcomes
The critical outcomes were patient outcomes (such as mortality, survival, and recovery), and adverse effects. Important outcomes were utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, and knowledge about trauma care services. Studies only reported patient outcomes (mortality, survival); there were no reports on adverse effects, utilisation and access to services, quality of care, equity, and knowledge about trauma care services.

Risk of bias
We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool and guidance from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group to evaluate individual studies.

Synthesis methods
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We could not perform a meta‚Äêanalysis due to substantial clinical heterogeneity across studies. We re‚Äêanalysed data from individual studies so they could be presented in a standardised format as relative effect, change in level, and change in slope. We summarised findings using a narrative synthesis."""
